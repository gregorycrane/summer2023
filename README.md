* also not found (but not listed by the Fs
** Soloecist -- probably not by L and included in vol 8 of the Loeb

* ideally, we should be able to align speakers/speeches with the Greek but I imediately see that Harmon does not include speakers for the Greek of Nigrinus (although they are in the English). Jacobiwitz does include the speakers in his Greek.

* what to do about the True History citation? how do citations work? there is:

** an intro: sect 1-4
** book 1 -- starts at sect 5
** book 2 -- restarts at sect 1
