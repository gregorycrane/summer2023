<head>On the Migration of Abraham</head>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="1"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="1"/> “And the Lord said unto Abraham, Depart out

of thy land, and out of thy kindred, and out of thy father’s house, into the land which I shall shew thee; and I will make thee a great nation and will bless thee and will make thy name great, and thou shalt be blessed. And I will bless them that bless thee, and them that curse thee I will curse, and in thee shall all the tribes of the earth be blessed” (Gen. xii. 1–3).
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="2"><p>God begins the carrying out of His will

to cleanse man’s soul by giving it a starting-point for full salvation in its removal out of three localities, namely, body, sense-perception, and speech. “Land”
or “country” is a symbol of body, “kindred” of sense-perception, “father’s house” of speech. How so?</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="3"><p> Because the body took its substance out of

earth (or land) and is again resolved into earth. Moses is a witness to this, when he says, “Earth thou art and into earth shalt thou return” (Gen. iii. 19); indeed he also says that the body was clay formed into human shape by God’s moulding hand, and what suffers solution must needs be resolved into the elements which were united to form it. Sense-perception, again, is of one kin and family with understanding, the irrational with the rational, for both these are parts of one soul. And speech is our
“father’s house,” “father’s” because Mind is our

<pb n="135"/>

father, sowing in each of the parts of the body the faculties that issue from itself, and assigning to them their workings, being in control and charge of them all; house—because mind has speech for its house
<note n="4.135.a">Or “chamber,” <hi rend="italic">cf. Il.</hi> vi. 490 and elsewhere, where οἶκος is clearly the inner part of the house. For the thought that while mind has a wider range, its most intimate home is speech, cf. the explanation of τὸν ἔγγιστα as speech in <hi rend="italic">De Ebr.</hi> 71.</note>
  or living-room, secluded from the rest of the homestead. It is Mind’s living-place, just as the hearth-side is man’s.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="4"><p> It is there that Mind displays in

orderly form itself and all the conceptions to which it gives birth, treating it as a man treats a house.
And marvel not at Moses having given to speech the title of Mind’s house in man; for indeed he says that God, the Mind of the universe, has for His house His own Word.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="5"><p> It was the vision of

this Word that the Self-trainer received when he emphatically declares “This is assuredly not the House of God”
<note n="4.135.b">Or “this is not the House of God, only (yet) there is a House of God.” Mr. Whitaker defended his translation by suggesting that Philo is following the occasional use of ἀλλ᾿ ἤ in the LXX for “certainly,” e.g. 2 Chron. xix. 3. But the explanation which follows seems to me to point to the alternative translation given above, and in this case the use of ἀλλ᾿ ἤ would be something like that in Deut. iv. 12 (quoted in 48). In <hi rend="italic">De Som.</hi> i. 185 we have another way of taking the verse.</note>
  (Gen. xxviii. 17), as much as to say
“The House of God is not this that is all round me, consisting of things at which we can point or that fall under sense-perception generally, no, not such is God’s House, but invisible, withdrawn from sight, and apprehended only by soul as soul.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="6"><p>
<note n="4.135.c">Or “soul in the true sense of the word.” Philo means that he is not using the word in the wider sense of the whole soul or life of the animal, but for the mind or dominant principal. See App. p. 560.</note>
  Who, then, can

that House be, save the Word who is antecedent to all that has come into existence? the Word, which the Helmsman of the Universe grasps as a rudder to guide all things on their course? Even as, when He was fashioning the world, He employed it as His instrument, that the fabric of His handiwork might be without reproach.

<pb n="137"/>

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="7"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="2"/> We have now shewn how Moses uses “earth”

to represent the body, “kindred” to represent sense-perception, “thy father’s house” to represent speech. The words “Depart out of these” are not equivalent to “Sever thyself from them absolutely,”
since to issue such a command as that would be to prescribe death.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="8"><p> No, the words import “Make thyself a stranger to them in judgement and purpose; let none of them cling to thee; rise superior to them all; they are thy subjects, never treat them as

sovereign lords; thou art a king, school thyself once and for all to rule, not to be ruled; evermore be coming to know thyself, as Moses teaches thee in many places, saying “Give heed to thyself” (Ex. xxiv. 12), for in this way shalt thou perceive those to whom it befits thee to shew obedience and those to whom it befits thee to give commands.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="9"><p> Depart,


therefore, out of the earthly matter that encompasses thee: escape, man, from the foul prison-house, thy body, with all thy might and main, and from the pleasures and lusts that act as its jailers; every terror that can vex and hurt them, leave none of them unused; menace the enemy with them all united and combined.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="10"><p> Depart also out of sense-perception


thy kin. For at present thou hast made a loan of thyself to each sense, and art become the property of others, a portion of the goods of those who have borrowed thee, and hast thrown away the good thing that was thine own. Yes, thou knowest, even though all men should hold their peace, how eyes draw thee, and ears, and the whole crowd of thine other kinsfolk, towards what they themselves love.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="11"><p> But if thou desire to recover the self that thou

hast lent and to have thine own possessions about

<pb n="139"/>

thee, letting no portion of them be alienated and fall into other hands, thou shalt claim instead a happy life, enjoying in perpetuity the benefit and pleasure derived from good things not foreign to thee but thine own.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="12"><p>  Again, quit speech also, “thy


father’s house,” as Moses calls it, for fear thou shouldst be beguiled by beauties of mere phrasing, and be cut off from the real beauty, which lies in the matter expressed. Monstrous it is that shadow should be preferred to substance or a copy to originals. And verbal expression is like a shadow or copy, while the essential bearing of the matters conveyed by words resembles substance and originals; and it behoves the man, whose aim it is to be rather than to seem, to dissociate himself from the former and hold fast to the latter.

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="13"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="3"/> So we find


that when the Mind begins to know itself and to hold converse with the things of mind, it will thrust away from it that part of the soul which inclines to the province of sense-perception, the inclining which among the Hebrews is entitled “Lot.” Hence the wise man is represented as saying outright, “Separate thyself from me” (Gen. xiii. 9). For it is impossible for one who is possessed by love for all that is incorporeal and incorruptible to dwell together with one who leans towards the objects of sense-perception doomed to die.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="14"><p> Right well, then, did the Sacred

Guide inscribe one entire sacred book of the Lawgiving “Exagoge” or “Leading out,” for the name thus found was appropriate to the oracles contained in it. For being well qualified to train men and fully furnished for the admonition and correction of those who were capable of admonition and correction, he contemplates the task of taking out all the population

<pb n="141"/>

of the soul right away from Egypt, the body, and away from its inhabitants; deeming it a most sore and heavy burden that an understanding endowed with vision should be under the pressure of the pleasures of the flesh, and should submit to such injunctions as its merciless cravings may lay upon it.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="15"><p> These, indeed, groaned over and greatly bewailed

their bodily well-being, and the lavish abundance of things outside the body,
<note n="4.141.a">“Things outside the body” (see note on <hi rend="italic">Quod Det.</hi> 7) interpret the “inhabitants of Egypt” in § 14, as “the things of the body” interpret Egypt.</note>
  which was theirs, for we read that “the children of Israel groaned by reason of their works
<note n="4.141.b">For the interpretation of these “works” or tasks as slavery to the passions and the like <hi rend="italic">cf. De Conf.</hi> 93.</note>
 ” (Ex. ii. 23). When they do this, the gracious God instructs His prophet regarding their coming out, and His prophet delivers them.
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="16"><p><milestone unit="para"/>
<note n="4.141.c">Here begins the digression about Joseph which continues to the end of § 24. The opening words of § 16 are a meditation on Gen. 1, 26 “And Joseph died (ἐτελεύτησε. cf. μέχρι τῆς τελευτῆς) and was buried, and they laid him in a <hi rend="italic">coffin</hi> (σορῷ), in <hi rend="italic">Egypt</hi>. ” The lesson deduced is that the compromising Joseph-nature is “buried in the body” and forgotten, but it may have higher things or “bones”. These are remembered and serve to kindle excellence in others.</note>
 But some make a truce with the body and maintain

it till their death, and are buried in it as in a coffin or shell or whatever else you like to call it. All the body-loving and passion-loving portions of these are laid in the grave and consigned to oblivion. But if anywhere by the side of these there grows up a virtue-loving tendency, it is saved from extinction by memories, which are a means of keeping alive the flame of noble qualities.

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="17"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="4"/> So the Holy


Word, deeming it unfitting that pure things should have impure things associated with them, provides for the safe-keeping of Joseph’s bones, by which I mean the only relics of such a soul as were left behind untouched by corruption and worthy of perpetual memory (Gen. 1.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="18"><p> 25).
<note n="4.141.d">See A pp. p. 560.</note>
   Those of the

latter kind were these; Joseph’s confidence that
“God will visit” the race that has vision (Gen. 1. 24),

and will not utterly hand it over to Ignorance, that blind task-mistress; his discernment between the mortal and the incorruptible portions of the soul and his leaving behind to Egypt those which had to do with bodily pleasures and other forms of unrestrained passion, while concerning the incorruptible parts he made an agreement, that they should accompany those who went up to the cities of virtue, and should be conveyed thither, and had the agreement secured by an oath.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="19"><p>  What, then, are the un-corrupted


parts?
<note n="4.143.a">See App. p. 560, on § 17.</note>
  His having nothing to do with Pleasure when she says, “Let us lie together” (Gen. xxxix. 7) and enjoy the good things of mankind: the shrewdness coupled with the resoluteness which enabled him to recognize the products of empty fancies which many accounted to be good, and to distinguish them as mere dreams from those which are really so; and to confess that the true and certain interpretations of things are given under God’s guidance (Gen. xl. 8), while the doubtful imaginations that have no certainty follow the rule and line of the erring and deluded life of men who have not undergone purification, a life that finds its joy in the delights provided by bakers and cooks
<note n="4.143.b">An allusion to the description of Potiphar in the LXX (Gen. xxxix. 1) as chief cook.</note>
  and butlers.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="20"><p> Other traits of incorruption were these: he was proclaimed

not the subject, but the ruler of all Egypt, the domain of the body (Gen. xli. 41): he was proud to own himself a member of the Hebrew race (Gen. xl. 15), whose wont it is, as the name “Hebrew”
or “Migrant” indicates, to quit the objects of sense-perception and go after those of Mind: he gloried in the fact that “here he had done nothing” (<hi rend="italic">ibid.</hi>), for to have performed no single act such as the worthless people there admired, but to have utterly

<pb n="145"/>

hated and eschewed them all, was conduct that called

for no slight praise:
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="21"><p>
he derided lusts and all passions and their gross excesses (Gen. xxxix. 14, 17):
<note n="4.145.a">See App. p. 560.</note>
  he feared God (Gen. xlii. 18) even though he was not yet ready to love Him: when in Egypt he claimed as his own the life that is real life,

<milestone unit="para"/>(<milestone unit="altchapter" n="5"/>) a claim which caused Israel to marvel in just amazement, and to cry, “It is a great matter in my eyes if my son Joseph still <hi rend="italic">lives</hi>”(Gen. xlv. 28), and has not shared the death of vain opinions, and of the body the corpse he carries with him:
<note n="4.145.b">The thought of the body as a dead thing from the first, which the soul supports, has been more fully developed in <hi rend="italic">Leg. All.</hi> iii. 69 f. <hi rend="italic">Cf.</hi> also <hi rend="italic">De Agr.</hi> 25.</note>
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="22"><p>  he confesses that he is God’s

(Gen. 1. 19),
<note n="4.145.c">E.V. “Am I in the place of God?”</note>
  not the property of any created being: when making himself known to his brethren he thrust perforce from his presence, shaken and tottering, all those frames of mind that make the body their delight and think that their own doctrines afford them a firm standing (Gen. xlv. 1 f.): he declared that he had not received his commission at the hands of men, but had been appointed by God (Gen. xlv. 7 f.) to be duly constituted controller of the body and of things outside the body.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="23"><p>
<note n="4.145.d">Again, as in § 15, the two lower goods serve to interpret “Lord of all his <hi rend="italic">house</hi> and ruler of all the <hi rend="italic">land of Egypt.</hi>’’</note>
   And these are


but a few of the traits indicative of the better and holier standing, which utterly refuse to dwell in Egypt the bodily tenement, are never buried in a coffin at all, but, having passed out of all that is mortal, follow the guiding steps of Moses, the Lawgiving Word.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="24"><p> For Moses is the nursing-father who

rears with fostering care noble deeds, words, designs, which, albeit often mingled with their opposites owing to the chaos and confusion which besets mortality, he none the less comes forward and separates from



<pb n="147"/>

the rest, that the germs and shoots of moral excellence may not permanently be obliterated and lost.
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="25"><p><milestone unit="para"/>Moses also urges the Israelites to quit right stoutly

her who bears the name of mother of every monstrous thing, with no slow or lingering steps, but with exceeding speed; for he bids them with haste to sacrifice the Passover (Ex. xii. 11), which means “a passing over,” to the intent that the Mind with resolute purpose and unfailing eagerness may carry out both its passing away from the passions without turning back, and its thanksgiving to God its Saviour, Who brought it forth into liberty when it looked not for it.

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="26"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="6"/> And what is there to wonder at


in his urging the mind, that had been brought under the control of irrational passion, not to give in, nor to be swept down by the violence of that passion’s current, but to resist with all its might, and, should it fail, even to run away? For flight remains as an alternative way of reaching safety for those who are not able to repel the danger. See how Moses deals with one who was by nature a sturdy fighter and had never become the slave of passions, but was always engaged in the conflict with each one of them?
<note n="4.147.a">The thought of §§ 26–30 seems to be that while ordinary souls, typified by Israel leaving Egypt, must shun outward temptations, because they will prove too strong for them, even the Jacob-souls, who have proved their superiority, will do well to detach themselves and become immersed in that higher wisdom represented by Isaac, which is beyond all worldly thoughts.</note>
  Even him he forbids to keep up his wrestlings to the end, lest one day, by perpetually meeting them, he should contract from them a pernicious taint; for many before now have proved imitators of an opponent’s vice, as others on the other hand have imitated his virtue.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="27"><p> For this reason a Divine intimation was

vouchsafed to him to this effect: “Turn back to the land of thy father and thy kindred, and I will be with thee” (Gen. xxxi. 3); as much as to say “Thou


<pb n="149"/>

hast proved thyself a perfect athlete, and been awarded prizes and crowns with Virtue presiding and holding forth to thee the meed of victory: but now it is time for thee to have done with strife, lest thou be ever toiling, and have no power to reap the fruits of thy toil.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="28"><p> This thou wilt never find while thou remainest

where thou art, dwelling still with the objects of sense-perception, and spending thy days surrounded by bodily existence in its varied aspects, whose head and chief is Laban, bearing a name meaning variety of character. Nay, thou must change thine abode and betake thee to thy father’s land, the land of the Word that is holy and in some sense father of those who submit to training: and that land is Wisdom, abode most choice of virtue-loving souls.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="29"><p> In this

country there awaiteth thee the nature which is its own pupil, its own teacher, that needs not to be fed on milk as children are fed,
<note n="4.149.a">Perhaps an allusion to Gen. xxi. 8 “and the child grew and was weaned” (ἀπεγαλακτίσθη).</note>
  that has been stayed by a Divine oracle from going down into Egypt (Gen. xxvi. 2) and from meeting with the ensnaring pleasures of the flesh. That nature is entitled Isaac.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="30"><p> When

thou hast entered upon his inheritance, thou canst not but lay aside thy toil; for the perpetual abundance of good things ever ready to the hand gives freedom from toil. And the fountain from which the good things are poured forth is the companionship of the bountiful God. He shews this to be so when to set His seal upon the flow of His kindnesses, He says “I will be with thee.”

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="31"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="7"/> What


fair thing, then, could fail when there was present God the Perfecter, with gifts of grace, His virgin daughters, whom the Father that begat them rears up uncorrupted and undefiled? Then are all forms of studying, toiling, practising at rest; and without

<pb n="151"/>

interference of art by contrivance of Nature there come forth all things in one outburst charged with benefit for all.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="32"><p> And the harvest of spontaneous


good things is called “Release,”
<note n="4.151.a">See App. p. 561.</note>
  inasmuch as the Mind is released from the working out of its own projects, and is, we may say, emancipated from self-chosen tasks, by reason of the abundance of the rain and ceaseless shower of blessings.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="33"><p> And these

are of a most marvellous nature and passing fair. For the offspring of the soul’s own travail are for the most part poor abortions, things untimely born; but those which God waters with the snows of heaven come to the birth perfect, complete and peerless.
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="34"><p>I feel no shame in recording my own

experience, a thing I know from its having happened to me a thousand times. On some occasions, after making up my mind to follow the usual course of writing on philosophical tenets, and knowing definitely the substance of what I was to set down, I have found my understanding incapable of giving birth to a single idea, and have given it up without accomplishing anything, reviling my understanding for its self-conceit, and filled with amazement at the might of Him that is to Whom is due the opening and closing of the soul-wombs.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="35"><p> On other

occasions, I have approached my work empty and suddenly become full, the ideas falling in a shower from above and being sown invisibly, so that under the influence of the Divine possession I have been filled with corybantic frenzy and been unconscious of anything, place, persons present, myself, words spoken, lines written. For I obtained language, ideas, an enjoyment of light, keenest vision, pellucid distinctness


<pb n="153"/>

of objects, such as might be received through the eyes as the result of clearest shewing.
<note n="4.153.a">The concluding word “<hi rend="italic">shewing</hi>” serves to bridge over transition from this meditation on the Spontaneous Blessings to the discussion of the First Gift to Abraham, i.e. “the land which I will <hi rend="italic">shew</hi> thee.”</note>


</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="36"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="8"/> Now the thing shewn is the thing worthy to

be seen, contemplated, loved, the perfect good, whose nature it is to change all that is bitter in the soul and make it sweet, fairest seasoning of all spices, turning into salutary nourishment even foods that do not nourish. So we read “The Lord shewed him a tree, and he cast it into the water” (Ex. xv. 25), that is into the flabby, flaccid mind teeming with bitterness, that its savagery might be sweetened away.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="37"><p> This

tree offers not nourishment only but immortality also, for we are told that the Tree of Life has been planted in the midst of the Garden (Gen. ii. 9), even Goodness with the particular virtues and the doings which accord with them to be its bodyguard. For it is Virtue that has obtained as its own the central and most honourable place in the soul.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="38"><p>  Such


is that which is shewn, and he that sees it is the wise man, for fools are blind or dim-sighted. That is why in former times they called the prophets seers (1 Sam. ix. 9); and the Trainer of self was eager to exchange ears for eyes, and to see what before he heard, and, going beyond the inheritance which has hearing as its source, he obtains that of which sight is the ruling principle.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="39"><p> For the current coin of learning and teaching

from which Jacob took his title is reminted into the seeing Israel. Hereby comes to pass even the seeing of the Divine light, identical with knowledge, which opens wide the soul’s eye, and leads it to apprehensions distinct and brilliant beyond those

gained by the ears.
<note n="4.155.a">i.e. the Israel-soul, the seer, first sees the light, i.e. knowledge, and this in its turn enables the soul’s eye to see the objects of knowledge, and so knowledge (or wisdom) is the “instrument” of sight (§ 40). ἀδιαφοροῦν agrees with φῶς, not with τὸ ὁρᾶν.</note>
  For as the application of the principles of music
<note n="4.155.b">That τά κατά means the “practical application” is brought out more clearly in <hi rend="italic">Quod Det</hi>. 114, where we have τά καθ᾿ ἑκάστην (sc. ἀρετὴν) ἑνεργήματα.</note>
  is apprehended through the science of music, and the practice of each science through that science, even so only through wisdom comes discernment of what is wise.</p></div>

not only, after the manner of light, an instrument of sight, but is able to see its own self besides. Wisdom is God’s archetypal luminary and the sun is a copy and image of it.  But he that shews each
several object is God, who alone is possessed of perfect knowledge. For men are only said to have knowledge because they seem to know; whereas God is so called because He <hi rend="italic">is</hi> the possessor of knowledge though the phrase does not adequately express this nature; for all things whatever that can be said regarding Him that is fall far short of the reality of His powers.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="41"><p> He gives clear proof of His wisdom not

only from His having been the Artificer of the universe, but also from His having made the knowledge of the things that had been brought into existence His sure possession.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="42"><p> For we read “God saw all

things that He had made” (Gen. i. 31). This does not just mean that He set His eyes on each of them, but that He had insight
<note n="4.155.c">See App. p. 562.</note>
  and knowledge and apprehension of the things which He had made. It follows then that to give teaching and guidance on each several thing, in fact to “shew” them, to the ignorant is proper only for the One who knows, seeing that He has not, as a man has, been profited by

science and its lore, but is acknowledged to be Himself the Source and Fountain-head of science and knowledge in all their forms.

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="43"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="9"/> There is a deliberate intention when his words

take the form of a promise and define the time of fulfilment not as present but future. He says not
“which I am shewing” but “which I will shew thee”
(Gen. xii. 1). Thus he testifies to the trust which the soul reposed in God, exhibiting its thankfulness not as called out by accomplished facts, but by expectation of what was to be.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="44"><p> For the soul, clinging in

utter dependence on a good hope, and deeming that things not present are beyond question already present by reason of the sure stedfastness of Him that promised them, has won as its meed faith, a perfect good; for we read a little later “Abraham believed God” (Gen. xv. 6). To Moses, too, He says in like manner, when He had shewn to him all the Land, “I shewed it to thine eyes, but thou shalt not enter in” (Deut. xxxiv.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="45"><p> 4). You must not think that

this was said, as some unconsidering people suppose, to humiliate
<note n="4.157.a">Or, as Mangey, “referring to the death of.”</note>
  the all-wise leader; for indeed it is folly to imagine that the servants of God take precedence of His friends in receiving their portion in the land of virtue.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="46"><p> No, what he wishes to bring home to you

first of all is that children have one place and full-grown men another, the one named training, the other called wisdom: secondly, that the fairest things in nature are objects of sight rather than of possession. For how is it possible to become possessed of things whose allotted place is nearer to the Divine? Yet to see them is within the bounds of possibility: though not for all. It is exclusively for the purest and most keen-eyed class, on whom the Father of all

<pb n="159"/>

things, by shewing to them His own works, bestows an all-surpassing gift.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="47"><p>  For what life is


better than a contemplative life, or more appropriate to a rational being? For this reason, whereas the voice of mortal beings is judged by hearing, the sacred oracles intimate that the words of God are seen as light is seen; for we are told that “all the people saw the Voice” (Ex. xx. 18), not that they heard it; for what was happening was not an impact on air made by the organs of mouth and tongue, but virtue shining with intense brilliance, wholly resembling a fountain of reason, and this is also indicated elsewhere on this wise: “Ye have seen that I have spoken to you out of Heaven” (Ex. xx. 22), not
“ye heard,” for the same cause as before.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="48"><p> In one

place the writer distinguishes things heard from things seen and hearing from sight, saying, “Ye heard a voice of words, and saw no similitude but only a voice” (Deut. iv. 12), making a very subtle distinction, for the voice dividing itself into noun and verb and the parts of speech in general
<note n="4.159.a">Philo connects the “voice of words” with the grammatical use of ῥήματα for verbs and supposes the verse to mean “ordinary human voice you hear, but God’s voice you see.”</note>
  he naturally spoke of as “audible,” for it comes to the test of hearing: but the voice or sound that was not that of verbs and nouns but of God, seen by the eye of the soul, he rightly represents as “visible.”</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="49"><p> And after first

saying “Ye saw no similitude” he adds “but only a Voice,” evidently meaning the reader to supply in thought “which you did see.” This shews that words spoken by God are interpreted by the power of sight residing in the soul, whereas those which are divided up among the various parts of speech
<note n="4.159.b">See App. p. 562.</note>
  appeal to hearing.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="50"><p>  Fresh and original as is the


insight which he shews in all cases, there is a special


<pb n="161"/>

and unusual originality in this instance in his saying that the voice is visible, practically the only thing in us, if understanding be left out of consideration, which is not visible: for the objects of the senses other than the eyes are all of them, colours, savours, perfumes, things warm, things cold, things smooth, things rough, things soft and hard, visible as bodies.
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="51"><p>What this means I will state more

clearly. The savour is visible, not as a savour, but only as a body, for as savour, it is the taste that will know it; and the odour, as odour, will be assayed by the nostrils, but as body, by the eyes also; and the rest will be subject to the same double test.
<note n="4.161.a">The thought seems to be that, while none of our sensa- tions are visible, those of taste, smell, and touch are produced by visible objects.</note>
  But it is not the nature of voice to be visible whether we regard it as something audible or as body, if body indeed it is;
<note n="4.161.b">According to the Stoics φωνή is a body, but Philo does not unreservedly accept this.</note>
  but of our properties these two are invisible, mind and speech.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="52"><p> The truth is that our

sound-producer is not similar to the Divine organ of voice; for ours mingles with air and betakes itself to the place akin to it, the ears; but the Divine is an organ of pure and unalloyed speech, too subtle for the hearing to catch it, but visible to the soul which is single in virtue of its keenness of sight.

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="53"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="10"/> So then, the first boon which God vouchsafes

to the soul after it has relinquished mortal things is, as I have said, the shewing of things immortal and the power to contemplate them; and the second, progress in the principles of virtue, alike as regards number and “greatness”: for He says, “And I will make thee to become a great nation,” implying by the word “nation” their number, and by the



<pb n="163"/>

word “great” their improvement in quality.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="54"><p>
<note n="4.163.a">Lit. “growth to something better.”</note>
  How

great their advance was in either respect, alike in
“greatness” and in number, is made evident by the words of the King of Egypt, “Lo the race of the children of Israel is a great multitude “(Ex. i. 9). There he bears witness to the race that has eyes to see Him that is, that it has acquired both multitude and greatness, high achievement, that is, both in conduct of life and in principle.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="55"><p>
<note n="4.163.b">See App. p. 562.</note>
  For he did not say,

as a man strictly observing the association of noun and epithet would say, “much multitude,” but “a great multitude,” knowing that “much” is but an incomplete greatness, if it stands by itself without the addition of the power to understand and know. For what advantage is there in receiving (from our teachers) the results of study in plenty, unless we go on to develop each of them to its fitting stature? For a field, too, is but an imperfect one which contains any number of plants only a little above the ground, but in which no fully formed growth has shot up aided by skilful tillage and able now to yield fruit.
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="56"><p>The greatness and large number of the

good and noble has for its beginning and end the perpetual recollection of God, and the calling down of the aid that comes from Him, to counter the intestine warfare of life, unbroken in its bewildering irregularity, for it says: “Lo this great nation is a wise and understanding people: for what kind of great nation is there, which has God drawing nigh to it, as the Lord our God in all things in which we call upon Him?“ (Deut. iv.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="57"><p> 6 f.).  So far it


has been shewn that there is waiting ready and equipped at God’s side strong help to come to our succour, and that the Sovereign Ruler will Himself

draw near for the benefit of those who are worthy to receive His benefits.

<milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="11"/> But who are they that are worthy to obtain these? Is it not clear that all the lovers of wisdom and knowledge are so?</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="58"><p> For

these are the wise and understanding people which was spoken of, each member of which is with good reason great, since he reaches out after great things; and after one most eagerly, never to be severed from God, the supremely Great, but without dismay stedfastly to abide His approach as He draws near.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="59"><p> This

is the defining mark of the people that is “great,”
to draw nigh to God, or to be that “to which God draws nigh.”  Now the world and the
wise man, the world-citizen,
<note n="4.165.a">See note on <hi rend="italic">De Op.</hi> 3.</note>
  is filled full of good things many and great, but the remaining mass of men experiences evil things in greater number, but fewer good things; for in the medley and confusion of human life that which is fair and goodly is rare and scanty.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="60"><p> And for this reason the sacred oracles contain

this utterance: “Not because ye are numerous beyond all the nations did the Lord prefer and choose you out: for ye surpass all the nations in fewness; but because the Lord loveth you “(Deut. vii. 7 f.). For were a man to desire to distribute, as it were into nations, the crowd contained in a single soul, many disorderly companies would he find, commanded by pleasures or desires or griefs or fears or again by follies and wrongdoings, and the nearest kinsfolk of these, but one only well-ordered, of which right reason is the captain.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="61"><p>  Now, in the judgement


of men the multitude of the unjust is preferred to the single just; but in God’s judgement the few good to the myriad unjust; and He charges the just


<pb n="167"/>

never to agree with such a multitude: for He says
“Thou shalt not be with many to engage in wickedness” (Ex. xxiii. 2). Should we then be so with few? Nay, not with any bad man: and the bad man, one though he be, is made manifold by wickednesses, and to range oneself by his side is a very great disaster: on the contrary it behoves us to shew a vigour free from terror and resist him and be at war with him.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="62"><p> For it says “If thou go out to war against

thine enemies and see horse and rider,” that is passion, the insolent, the restive, the unruly, and the passion-loving mind mounted on it, “and a people more numerous than thou art,” even the devoted followers of these leaders advancing in serried mass
“thou shalt not be afraid of them.” One as thou art thou shalt have One fighting on thy side, even the Ruler of all, as it says, “for the Lord Thy God is with thee” (Deut. xx.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="63"><p> 1). This companionship

brings wars to an end, builds up peace, overthrows the host of evil things to which we grow accustomed, rescues the scanty band of those beloved of God, every loyal adherent of which loathes and hates the battalions of the earth-bound.

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="64"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="12"/> For


it says: “Whatsoever hath many feet among all creeping things that creep upon the earth, ye shall not eat, for they are an abomination” (Lev. xi. 42). Now, is not a soul deserving of hatred which moves over the ground not on one part of itself but on all or most parts, even licking with a relish the things of the body, and altogether incapable of lifting its eyes to the holy revolutions of heaven?</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="65"><p> And further

among creeping things just as that which has many feet is disallowed, so too is that which has no feet, the former for the reason just given, the latter because

<pb n="169"/>

it lies its full length sprawling upon the earth, lifted out of it by nothing even to the smallest extent: for it says that all that goeth upon the belly is unclean (<hi rend="italic">ibid.</hi>), indicating by this figure the man who is in pursuit of the pleasures of the belly.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="66"><p>  But some, exceeding all bounds, in their determination

to kindle into activity all the irrational portion of the soul, and to destroy the mind, have not only indulged all that comes under the head of desire, but taken to them also its brother passion, fierce spirit. For that which was said, “Upon thy breast and thy belly shalt thou go” (Gen. iii. 14), in the literal sense applies to the serpent, but is really a truly Divine oracle applying to every irrational and passion-loving man; for the breast is the abode of fierce spirit, and desire dwells in the belly.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="67"><p> The fool’s whole course

through every moment of his journey depends on this pair, fierce spirit and desire; since he has got rid of mind, who is the charioteer and monitor. The man of the opposite character has exscinded fierce spirit and desire, and chosen as his patron and controlling guide the Divine Word. Even so Moses, best beloved of God, when offering the whole burnt sacrifices of the soul, will “wash out the belly” (Lev. viii. 21), that is, will cleanse away desire in every shape, but “the breast from the ram of consecration he will take away” (Lev. viii. 29). This means, we may be sure, the warlike spirit in its completeness; and the object of taking it away is that the better portion of the soul, the rational part, that is left, may exercise its truly free and noble impulses towards all things beautiful, with nothing pulling against it any longer and dragging it in another direction.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="68"><p>  In these circumstances it will improve both in number



<pb n="171"/>

and greatness: for it is said: “How long shall the people provoke? and how long shall they refuse to trust Me in all the signs which I wrought among them? I will smite them with death and will destroy them, and I will make thee and thy father’s house a nation great and numerous beyond this one”
(Num. xiv. 11 f.). For, in the soul when once the great concourse is broken up, in which fierce spirit and desire prevail, there rises and springs up without fail another concourse, even that which wholly depends on the rational nature.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="69"><p>  Now


just as the creature with many feet and that without feet, opposite species in the genus of creeping things, are proclaimed unclean, so also atheism and polytheism, mutually antagonistic doctrines in the soul, are alike profane. Here is the indication of this: the Law has expelled both of these doctrines from the sacred assembly, atheism, by debarring a eunuch from membership of it;
<note n="4.171.a"><hi rend="italic">Cf. De Ebr.</hi> 213.</note>
  polytheism, by likewise forbidding the son of a harlot to be a listener or speaker in it (Deut. xxiii. 1 f.). For the sterile man is godless; and the son of a whore is a polytheist, being in the dark about his real father, and for this reason ascribing his begetting to many, instead of to one.

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="70"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="13"/> Two gifts have been already spoken of, which

are these, a hope held out of a life of contemplation, and progress towards abundance and “greatness” of things fair and beautiful. A third gift is
“blessing” or excellence of reason and speech, and apart from this it is not possible to make the former gracious gifts secure. He says “And I will bless thee,” i.e.
“I will endow thee with excellent reason and speech.”
“Blessing” or “eulogy” is a word compounded of

<pb n="173"/>

“well” and “logos.”</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="71"><p> Of these, “well” connotes

nothing but excellence: “logos” has two aspects, one resembling a spring, the other its outflow; “logos” in the understanding resembles a spring, and is called
“reason,” while utterance by mouth and tongue is like its outflow, and is called “speech.” That each species of logos should be improved is vast wealth, the understanding having good reasoning
<note n="4.173.a">For Philo’s use of εὐλογιστία in connexion with εὐλογεῖν see note on <hi rend="italic">De Sobr.</hi> 18.</note>
  at its command for all things great and small, and utterance being under the guidance of right training.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="72"><p> For many

reason excellently, but find speech a bad interpreter of thought and are by it betrayed, through not having had a thorough grounding in the ordinary subjects of culture. Others, again, have shewn great ability in expounding themes, and yet been most evil thinkers, such as the so-called sophists; for the understanding of these men is wholly untrained by the Muses, whose united voice is heard in the output of the vocal organs.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="73"><p> But God bestows on those who obey Him no imperfect

boon. All His gifts are full and complete. And so, in this case also, He does not send the blessing or “logos-excellence” in one division of logos, but in both its parts, for He holds it just that the recipient of His bounty should both conceive the noblest conceptions and give masterly expression to his ideas. For perfection depends, as we know, on both divisions of logos, the reason which suggests the ideas with clearness, and the speech which gives unfailing expression to them.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="74"><p>  Do you not notice


Abel, whose name stands for one to whom things mortal are a grief and things immortal are full of happiness, how, though he has the advantage of a faultless understanding, yet through lack of training in speaking he is worsted by Cain, a clever wrestler

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="75"><p> Wherefore,


admiring as I do his character for its rich natural endowment, I find fault with him in so far as, when challenged to a contest of words, he came forward to engage in it, whereas he ought to have maintained his wonted quietude, totally disregarding his quarrelsome brother; and, if he was quite bent on fighting it out, not to have entered the lists until he had had some practice in scientific grips and tricks; for village sages usually get the worst of it when they encounter those who have acquired the cleverness of the town.

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="76"><p><milestone unit="para"/> <milestone unit="altchapter" n="14"/> That is why Moses, the man of all

wisdom, though he excuses himself from investigating well-worded and specious arguments, from the time that God began to flash into him the light of truth by means of the undying words of the very self of Knowledge and Wisdom (Ex. iv. 10), yet is led none the less to look into them, not for the sake of gaining acquaintance with a greater number of subjects—for the lover of contemplation finds researches touching God and His most holy powers all-sufficing—but with a view to getting the better of the sophists in Egypt, for whom specious sounding fables are of more value than the clear evidence of realities.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="77"><p> Yes, whensoever

the mind is moving amid matters concerned with the Ruler of all, it needs no extraneous help in its study, inasmuch as for objects of intellectual apprehension unaided mind is an eye of keenest sight: but when it is occupied besides with matters affected by sense-perception or passion or the body, of which the land of Egypt is a symbol, it will need alike the art of speaking and ability in exercising it.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="78"><p> For the sake


of this he was enjoined to call to his aid Aaron, the logos in utterance. “Lo,” saith He, “is not Aaron

thy brother?” For the logical nature being the one mother of them both, its offspring are of course brothers. “I know that he will speak” (He continues). For it is the property of understanding to apprehend, and of utterance to speak. “He,” saith He, “will speak for thee.” For the mind, unable to report
<note n="4.177.a">Or “express.” ἀπαγγελία is often used in rhetoric as a synonym for ἑρμηνεία. See on § 35.</note>
  the thoughts stored up in it, employs speech which stands hard by as an interpreter, for the making known of its experiences.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="79"><p> Then He adds, “Lo, it is

he that shall come out to meet thee”: for it is indeed a fact that speech meeting the mind’s conceptions, and wedding the parts of speech to them, mints them like uncoined gold, and gives the stamp of expression to what was unstamped and unexpressed before.
<note n="4.177.b">See App. p. 563.</note>
  And saith He, “On seeing thee he will rejoice in it
<note n="4.177.c">Or “in himself” (ἐν αὑτῷ). See App. p. 563.</note>
 ” (Ex. iv. 14): for speech does exult and is glad, when the conception is not indistinct, because it finds that the wording which issues from its rich store of terms apt and expressive and full of vividness is fluent and unhalting when the thought is luminous.

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="80"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="15"/> And similarly when the ideas to be expressed are

in any way deficient in clearness, speech is stepping on empty air and is apt to slip and have a bad fall and be unable to get up again. “And thou shalt speak to him and shall put My words into his mouth.” This is equivalent to saying “Thou shalt suggest to him the thoughts,’ for “thoughts” are nothing else than God’s “words” or speech.</p></div>

  For without the prompter

speech will give forth no utterance, and mind is the prompter of speech, as God is of mind. “And he shall speak to the people for thee, and he shall be thy mouth, and thou shalt be his Godward things”

(Ex. iv. 15 f.). Very vivid are his expressions. Not only does he say “he shall speak to them for thee,” as much as to say “he shall put thy thoughts into words”; but he adds “he shall be thy mouth”; for the stream of speech flowing over tongue and mouth carries forth the thoughts with it. But, whereas speech is understanding’s interpreter manward, understanding occupies toward speech the position of its God ward things, namely thoughts and intents, which are in God’s charge solely.</p></div>

vital matter, then, for one about to face a contest with sophists to have paid attention to words with such thoroughness as not only to elude the grips of his adversary but to take the offensive in his turn and prove himself superior both in skill and strength.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="83"><p> You must have observed how the aim of those who

name of “prophet,” when the mind too is inspired and entitled “God.” For He says “I give thee as God to Pharaoh, and Aaron thy brother shall be thy prophet” (Ex. vii. 1). How perfect is the harmony shewn in the sequence of thought! For it is the prophet kind, when under the influence of a Divine possession and ecstasy, that interprets the thoughts of God.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="85"><p>  Accordingly “Aaron’s rod swallowed


up their rods” (Ex. vii. 12), as the oracle shews. For all the arguments of sophists are devoured and done away with by Nature’s many-sided skill, and the acknowledgement is made that these events are the Finger of God (Ex. viii. 19), and the word “Finger” is equivalent to a divine rescript, declaring that sophistry is ever defeated by wisdom; for holy writ, speaking of the tables on which the oracles were engraved, says that they were written by the Finger of God (Ex. xxxii. 16). Wherefore the sorcerers can no longer stand before Moses, but fall as in a wrestling-bout vanquished by the sturdy strength of the opponent (Ex. viii. 18).

<milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="16"/> What, then, is the fourth gift?</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="86"><p> That of a

great name; for He says “I will make thy name great” (Gen. xii. 2). The meaning of this appears to me to be as follows. As it is an advantage to be good and morally noble, so is it to be reputed such. And, while the reality is better than the reputation, happiness comes of having both. For very many, after coming to Virtue’s feet with no counterfeit or unreal homage and with their eyes open to her genuine loveliness, through paying no regard to the general opinion have become the objects of hostility, just because they were held to be bad. when they were really good.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="87"><p> It is true that there is no good in being

thought to be this or that, unless you are so long before you are thought to be so. It is naturally so in the case of our bodies.

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="88"><p> But he on whom God

gave in charge not to men only but to women also to provide the sacred appointments of the Tabernacle: for it is the women who do all the weavings of blue and scarlet and linen and goat’s hair (Ex. xxxv. 22 f.), and they contribute without hesitation their own jewellery, “seals, ear-rings, rings, bracelets, hair-clasps,” all that was made of gold, exchanging the adornment of their persons for the adornment of piety.</p></div>

  that is, the purposes which they take in hand and which form the base and support of the mind, may be helped to see themselves reflected by recollecting the mirrors out of which the laver was fashioned: for if they do this they will not overlook any ugly thing shewing itself in the appearance of the soul, and being thus purified will dedicate the most sacred and perfect of offerings, the offering of fasting
<note n="4.189.b">“Fasting,” in the spiritual sense of course, is interpreted by καρτερίας.

be one to be blessed” (Gen. xii. 2), not only “one who has been blessed,” for the latter is reckoned by the standard of the opinions and report of the many; but the former by that of Him Who is in reality

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="108"><p>For as being praiseworthy differs for the

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="109"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="20"/> These are the prizes which He bestows upon

him who is to become wise. Let us see next those which He accords to others too for the wise man’s sake. “I will bless,” He says, “those that bless thee, and those that curse thee I will curse” (Gen. xii.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="110"><p> 3). That these promises as well as the others are made to

shew honour to the righteous man is clear to everybody, but they are set forth not on that account only, but because they so admirably fit in with and follow the truth of facts, for encomiums are due to him who praises the good man and blame again to him who blames him. Praise and blame are not accredited so much by the ability of speakers and authors, as by the truth of facts; so that we do not feel that either

What then would a man of good sense say?</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="112"><p> Would

he not say that those who talk in this way talk as though they were enemies rather than friends, and blame rather than praise, even though they compose and recite whole oratorios of panegyric to charm them?</p></div>

Balaam, though he sang loftiest hymns to God, among which is that most Divine of canticles “God is not as man” (Num. xxiii. 19), and poured out a thousand eulogies on him whose eyes were open, even Israel, has been adjudged impious and accursed even by the wise lawgiver, and held to be an utterer not of blessings but of curses.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="114"><p> For Moses says that as

the hired confederate of Israel’s enemies he became an evil prophet of evil things, nursing in his soul direst curses on the race beloved of God, but forced with mouth and tongue to give prophetic utterance to most amazing benedictory prayers: for the words that were spoken were noble words, whose utterance was prompted by God the Lover of Virtue, but the intentions, in all their vileness, were the offspring of a mind that looked on virtue with loathing.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="115"><p> | Evidence of this is afforded by the oracles relating to

the matter; for it says “God did not give Balaam leave to curse thee, but turned his curses into blessing” (Deut. xxiii. 5), though indeed every word he

<pb n="199"/>

uttered was charged with fulness of benediction.
<note n="4.199.a">i.e. the text speaks of his “curses,” though actually there was no cursing at all.</note>
  But He Who looks upon what is stored up in the soul, saw, with the Eye that alone has power to discern them, the things that are out of sight of created beings, and on the ground of these passed the sentence of condemnation, being at once an absolutely true Witness, and an incorruptible Judge.  For
on the same principle praise is due to the converse of this, namely, when one seems to revile and accuse with the voice, and is in intent conveying blessing and benediction.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="116"><p> This is obviously the custom of

proctors,
<note n="4.199.b">The translation supposes that Philo is alluding to the Athenian office of σωφρονισταί, officials appointed to look after the morals of the Ephebi in general and particularly in the gymnasia.

But it is at least as probable that the word here means “moral censors” in general, and sums up the various forms of guardianship which follow.</note>
  of home tutors, schoolmasters, parents, seniors, magistrates, laws: all of these, by reproaches, and sometimes by punishments, effect improvement in the souls of those whom they are educating. And not one of them is an enemy to a single person, but all are friends of them all: and the business of friends inspired by genuine and unfeigned goodwill is to use plain language without any spite whatever.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="117"><p> Let no

treatment, then, that is marked by prayers and blessings on the one hand, or by abusing and cursing on the other hand, be referred to the way it finds vent in speech, but rather to the intention; for from this, as from a spring, is supplied the means of testing each kind of spoken words.

<milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="21"/> This is Moses’ first lesson;</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="118"><p> he tells us what

befalls others for the virtuous man’s sake, whenever they consent to visit him with blame or praise, with prayers or imprecations: but greatest of all is that which follows; he tells us that, when these hold their peace, no portion of rational existence is left without its share of benefit bestowed: for He says that “In


<pb n="201"/>

thee shall all the tribes of the earth be blessed” (Gen. xii.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="119"><p> 3). This is a pregnant and significant

announcement; for it implies that, if the mind continues free from harm and sickness, it has all its tribes and powers in a healthy condition, those whose province is sight and hearing and all others concerned with sense-perception, and those again that have to do with pleasures and desires, and all that are undergoing transformation from the lower to the higher emotions.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="120"><p>  Further there have been instances


of a household or a city or a country or nations and regions of the earth enjoying great prosperity through a single man giving his mind to nobility of character. Most of all has this been so in the case of one on whom God has bestowed, together with a good purpose, irresistible power, just as He gives to the musician and every artist the instruments which his music or his art requires, or as He gives to fire logs as its material.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="121"><p> For in truth the righteous man is the

foundation on which mankind rests. All that he himself has he brings into the common stock and gives in abundance for the benefit of all who shall use them. What he does not find in his own store, he asks for at the hands of God, the only possessor of unlimited riches; and He opens his heavenly treasury and sends His good things, as He does the snow and the rain, in ceaseless downpour, so that the channels and cavities of earth’s whole face overflow.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="122"><p> And it

is His wont to bestow these gifts in answer to the word
<note n="4.201.a">λόγος seems to anticipate ῥῆμα. Otherwise we might translate “His suppliant Word,” as Moses is sometimes identified with the Divine Logos.</note>
  of supplication, from which He does not turn His ear away; for it is said in another place, when Moses had made a petition, “I am gracious to them in accordance with thy word” (Num. xiv. 20); and this is evidently equivalent to “In thee shall all the tribes

<pb n="203"/>

of the earth be blessed.”  And it is by
reason of this that Abraham, the wise, when he had made trial of God’s unvarying loving-kindness, believed that, even if all else be done away, but some small relic of virtue be preserved as a live coal to kindle with, for the sake of this little piece He looks with pity on the rest also, so as to raise up fallen things and to quicken dead things (Gen. xviii.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="123"><p> 24 ff.). For a

smouldering spark, even the very smallest, when it is blown up and made to blaze, lights a great pile; and so the least particle of virtue, when, warmed into life by bright hopes, it has shone out, gives sight to eyes that erst were closed and blind, and causes withered things to bloom again, and recovers to prolific fertility all that were barren by nature and therefore without offspring. Even so scanty goodness by God’s favour expands and becomes abundant, assimilating all else to itself.

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="124"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="22"/> Let us pray then that, like a


central pillar in a house, there may constantly remain for the healing of our maladies the righteous mind in the soul and in the human race the righteous man; for while he is sound and well, there is no cause to despair of the prospect of complete salvation, for our Saviour God holds out, we may be sure, the most all-healing
remedy, His gracious Power, and commits it to His suppliant and worshipper to use for the deliverance of those who are sickly, that he may apply it as an embrocation to those soul-wounds which were left gaping by the sword-edge of follies and injustices and all the rest of the horde of vices.</p></div>

“Sarah” who is sound sense, give birth to a man-child, putting forth her fruit not according to the changes of the year measured by lapse of time, but in accordance with a fitness and fulness of season that time does not determine: for it is said “I will certainly return unto thee according to this season when the time comes round; and Sarah thy wife shall have a son” (Gen. xviii. 10).

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="127"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="23"/> We have now dealt with the subject of the

gifts which God is wont to bestow both on those who are to become wise and for their sake on others. We are told next that “Abraham journeyed even as the Lord spoke to him” (Gen. xii.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="128"><p> 4). This is the aim extolled

by the best philosophers, to live agreeably to nature;
<note n="4.205.d"><hi rend="italic">Cf. De Op.</hi> 3 and note. Philo here as elsewhere (<hi rend="italic">e.g. Quis Rerum</hi> 214) is suggesting that Greek philosophy is derived from Moses.</note>
  and it is attained whenever the mind, having entered on virtue’s path, walks in the track of right reason and follows God, mindful of His injunctions, and always and in all places recognizing them all as valid both in action and in speech.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="129"><p> For “he journeyed just as the



<pb n="207"/>
Lord spake to him”: the meaning of this is that as God speaks—and He speaks with consummate beauty and excellence—so the good man does everything, blamelessly keeping straight the path of life, so that the actions of the wise man are nothing else than the words of God.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="130"><p> So in another place He says, “Abraham

did
<note n="4.207.a">In the LXX, however, the verb is ἐφύλαξε, and not ἐποίησε which is demanded by the argument.</note>
  ‘all My law’” (Gen. xxvi. 5): “Law” being evidently nothing else than the Divine word enjoining what we ought to do and forbidding what we should not do, as Moses testifies by saying “he received a law from His words” (Deut. xxxiii. 3 f.). If, then, the law is a Divine word, and the man of true worth “does” the law, he assuredly “does” the word: so that, as I said, God’s words are the wise man’s “doings.”</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="131"><p> To follow God is, then, according

to Moses, that most holy man, our aim and object, as he says elsewhere too, “thou shalt go in the steps of the Lord thy God” (Deut. xiii. 4). He is not speaking of movement by the use of our legs, for, while earth carries man, I do not know whether even the whole universe carries God; but is evidently employing figurative language to bring out how the soul should comply with those Divine ordinances, the guiding principle of which is the honouring of Him to Whom all things owe their being.

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="132"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="24"/> Using


still loftier language to express the irrepressible craving for moral excellence, he calls on them to <hi rend="italic">cleave</hi> to Him. His words are: “Thou shalt fear the Lord thy God, and Him shalt thou serve, and to Him shalt thou cleave “(Deut. x. 20). What then is the cementing substance? Do you ask, what? Piety, surely, and faith: for these virtues adjust and unite the intent of the heart to the incorruptible Being: as Abraham when he believed is said to “come near

<pb n="209"/>

to God” (Gen. xviii.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="133"><p> 23).  If, however, as


he goes on his way, he neither becomes weary, so that he gives in and collapses, nor grows remiss, so that he turns aside, now in this direction, now in that, and goes astray missing the central road that never diverges; but, taking the good runners as his example, finishes the race of life without stumbling, when he has reached the end he shall obtain crowns and prizes as a fitting guerdon.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="134"><p> Are not the crowns and prizes

just this, not to have missed the end of his labours, but to have obtained those final aims of good sense that are so hard of attainment?  What,

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="135"><p> Accordingly Moses does right well in representing

Him as both the Father of the universe and Overseer of the things created, where he says: “God saw all things which He had made, and lo! they were fair exceedingly” (Gen. i. 31): for it was not possible for anyone perfectly to see the things which had been formed save their Maker.</p></div>

“Lot went with him” (Gen. xii. 4). “Lot” by interpretation is “turning aside” or “inclining away.” The mind “inclines,” sometimes turning away from what is good, sometimes from what is bad. Oftentimes both tendencies are observable in one and the same person: for some men are irresolute, facers both ways, inclining to either side like a boat tossed by winds from opposite quarters, or swaying up and down as though on a pair of scales, incapable of becoming firmly settled on one: with such there is nothing praiseworthy even in their taking a turn to the better course; for it is the result not of judgement but of drift.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="149"><p> Of this crew Lot is a member, who is

said to have left his home with the lover of wisdom. When he had set out to follow his steps, it would have been well for him to unlearn lack of learning and to have retraced his steps to it no more.

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="150"><p> Here

politician takes his position in the midst between the house of Pharaoh and his father’s house? that his object is to be equally in touch with the concerns of the body, which is Egypt, and those of the soul which are kept as in a treasury in his father’s house? For when he says “I belong to God” (Gen. 1. 19) and other things of this kind, he is abiding by the customs of his father’s house. But when he mounts “the second chariot” of the mind that fancies itself a king, even Pharaoh (Gen. xli. 43), he again sets up the idol of Egyptian vanity.</p></div>

<note n="4.227.b">The meaning of the section seems to be as follows. To the Israel mind the mixed cavalcade of Ex. xli. is confusion; that of Gen. l. is not so to the Joseph mind. Moses regulates his language in speaking of each multitude by what the two minds would think of them.</note>

Aunan represents the vision-lover, for it means “eyes,” since the eyes of the soul also are opened by cheerfulness.

equality in virtues, when labour has vied with natural fitness, and acquired skill with self-tutored

It is just as though painting and sculpture were producing not only as they do now creations destitute of movement and life, but had the power to make the works of brush and chisel living and moving things; it would then be felt, that whereas they were formerly arts copying Nature’s works, they had now become themselves embodiments of nature.
<note n="4.229.a">The gist of this and the preceding sections may be summed up thus.

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="206"><p> And so the maidens say what perfectly fits in with

what they really are. “Our father died”—yes, the death of recollection is forgetfulness—“and he died by reason of no sin of his own”—quite rightly said, for forgetfulness is no voluntary experience, but one of those things that are not in our power, coming upon us from outside—“and he had no sons” (Num. xxvii. 3), but only daughters, for whereas the faculty of memory, being naturally wide awake, has male progeny, forgetfulness, wrapt in a slumber of reasoning power, has female offspring; for it is irrational, and the senses are daughters of the irrational portion of the soul.
