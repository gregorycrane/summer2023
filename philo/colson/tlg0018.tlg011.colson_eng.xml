<head>On Drunkenness</head>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="1"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="1"/> The views expressed by the other philosophers

on drunkenness have been stated by me to the best of my ability in the preceding book. Let us now consider what the great lawgiver in his never-failing wisdom holds on this subject.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="2"><p> In many places of

his legislation he mentions wine and the plant whose fruit it is—the vine. Some persons he permits, others he forbids, to drink of it, and sometimes he gives opposite orders,
<note n="3.319.a">See App. p. 500.</note>
  at one time enjoining and at another prohibiting its use to the same persons. These last are those who have made the great vow (Num. vi. 2), while those who are forbidden the use of strong drink are the ministering priests (Lev. x. 9); while of persons who take wine there are numberless instances among those whom he too holds in the highest admiration for their virtue.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="3"><p>  But before we begin to discuss these matters, we

must carefully investigate the points which bear on our exposition. These points, I think, are the following.

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="4"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="2"/> Moses uses strong liquor as a symbol

for more than one, in fact for several, things: for foolish talking and raving, for complete insensibility, for insatiable and ever-discontented greediness, for cheerfulness and gladness, for the nakedness which embraces the rest and manifests itself in all the

<pb n="321"/>

qualities just mentioned,
<note n="3.321.a"><hi rend="italic">Cf. Leg. All.</hi> ii. 54, where three kinds of nakedness are distinguished: (<hi rend="italic">a</hi>) that of the soul stripped of passion, a state which to Philo is true joy; (<hi rend="italic">b</hi>) foolishness, as in the case of Noah (60 f.); (<hi rend="italic">c</hi>) ignorance of good and evil, as in Adam and Eve (64 f.).</note>
  in which condition Noah was, we read, when intoxicated. All these we are told are produced by wine.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="5"><p> Yet thousands of those

who never touch strong drink and consider themselves sober are mastered by similar emotions. We may see them in some cases mad and foolish, in others under the dominion of complete insensibility, in others never filled but always thirsting for impossibilities through lack of knowledge, or on the other hand full of gladness and exultation, finally in the true sense naked.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="6"><p>  The folly is caused by

indiscipline in its noxious form, by which I mean not the mere unacquaintance with discipline but aversion to it; insensibility is caused by ignorance (always) blind and (often) with a will for evil
<note n="3.321.b">The two epithets are explained in §§ 150–163. Ignorance is always blindness, but when under the delusion that it is knowledge it is actually mischievous (§ 163).</note>
 ; greediness by that most painful of the soul’s passions, lust; whizle gladness arises both from the winning and the practice of virtue. Nakedness has many causes: incapacity for distinguishing between moral opposites, innocence and simplicity of manners, truth, that is, the power which unveils
<note n="3.321.c">Lit. “celebrating the unveiling” (of the bride), <hi rend="italic">v. Dict. of Ant.</hi> (“Matrimonium”).</note>
  what is wrapped in obscurity. At one moment it is virtue that she uncovers, at another vice in its turn.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="7"><p> For we cannot

doff both of these at the same moment any more than we can don them. When we discard the one we necessarily adopt and assume its opposite.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="8"><p>  The old story
<note n="3.321.d">i.e. the fable suggested by Socrates (<hi rend="italic">Phaedo</hi> 60 B) where we have much the same phrase as here, ἐκ μιᾶς κορυφῆς συνημμένω δύ᾿ ὄντε, <hi rend="italic">v.</hi> note (App.) on <hi rend="italic">De Gig.</hi> 56.</note>
  tells us that God when He fastened

the naturally conflicting sensations of pleasure and





<pb n="323"/>

pain under a single head, caused them to be felt at different times and not at the same moment, and thus decreed that the banishment of the one should involve the restoration of the other. Just in the same way, from a single root in our dominant part spring the two shoots of vice and virtue, yet never sprouting or bearing fruit at the same moment.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="9"><p> For when one

sheds its leaves and withers, its opposite begins to exhibit new life and verdure, so that we might suppose that each shrinks and shrivels in resentment at the thriving of the other.  And so it is
in full agreement with philosophical truth that Moses represents the outgoing of Jacob as being the incoming of Esau. “It came to pass,” he says, “that as soon as Jacob went out Esau his brother came in”
(Gen. xxvii.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="10"><p> 30).
<note n="3.323.a">We have the same use of the text in <hi rend="italic">De Sac.</hi> 135.</note>
  For so long as prudence has its

lodging and scene of action in the soul, so long is every friend of folly an outcast from her borders. But when prudence has changed her quarters, the other returns with glee now that the bitter enemy, who caused his expulsion and life of exile, no longer dwells where he did.

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="11"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="3"/> So much then for what we may call the preliminaries

of our treatise. I will now proceed to the demonstration of each head beginning with the first. Well, we agreed that indiscipline was the cause of folly and error, as wine when taken in large quantities is to so many foolish persons.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="12"><p> Indiscipline is

indeed the prime cause of the soul’s errors, and from it as from a spring flow those actions of our lives which give to none any Sweet and salutary stream, but only briny waters fraught with plague and destruction to those who use them.



<pb n="325"/>

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="13"><p>Thus it is against the untrained and undisciplined

more perhaps than against any other person that the lawgiver breathes slaughter. Here is our proof. Who play the part of protectors not so much by acquired habit as by nature amongst humankind and every other kind of animal? Surely it is the parents. Not even a madman would give a different answer. For nature ever instinctively prompts the maker to care for what he has made, and to take thought for its preservation and perpetual maintenance.

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="14"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="4"/> Now when Moses set up those who would properly

plead the cause of an offender, namely his father and mother, to appear as his accusers, thus providing that those who might be expected to preserve him against all others should actually work his ruin,
<note n="3.325.a">Or “should be the sole workers of his ruin”; μόνων may perhaps be taken with both verbs.</note>
  he shewed his desire that these natural supporters should be converted into enemies. “For if anyone,” he says, “has a disobedient and contentious son who does not listen to the voice of his father and mother, and they discipline him and he does not hearken to them, his father and mother shall take him and bring him forth to the assembly of the elders of his city and to the gate of his place, and shall say to the men of their city, ‘This our son is disobedient and contentious, he does not listen to our voice, he is a riotous liver
<note n="3.325.b">See App. p. 500.</note>
  and a wine-bibber,’ and the men of the city shall stone him with stones and thou shalt remove the evil one from among yourselves” (Deut. xxi.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="15"><p> 18–21).  We see then that the accusations


are four in number, disobedience, contentiousness, participation in riotous feasting
<note n="3.325.c">Lit. “paying of contributions.”</note>
  and drunkenness. But the last is the chief, rising to a climax from the first, disobedience. For when the soul has begun to cast off the reins and taken its onward

<pb n="327"/>

course through strife and dissension, it reaches its utmost limit in drunkenness, which produces frenzy and madness. We must take these accusations one by one and observe their full meaning, beginning with the first.

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="16"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="5"/> We have it as a clear and admitted fact that

submission and obedience to virtue is noble and profitable, and the converse follows, that disobedience is disgraceful and in a high degree unprofitable. But if contentiousness is added to disobedience, it involves a vast increase of the evil. The disobedient man is not on so low a moral level as the quarrelsome and strife-loving man, since he merely disregards the commands he receives and nothing more, while the other takes active pains to carry out what is opposed to these commands.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="17"><p>  Let us consider how


this shews itself. The law, to take one instance, bids us honour our parents; he then who does not honour them is disobedient, he who actively dishonours them is a strife-lover. Again, it is a righteous action to save one’s country. He who shirks this particular duty is to be classed as disobedient, he who actually purposes to betray it as a man of strife and contention.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="18"><p> So too one who fails to do a kindness

to his neighbour, in opposition to another who tells him that it is his duty to give help, is disobedient. But one who, besides withholding his kindness, works all the harm he can is moved by the spirit of strife to deadly error. And again the man who fails to make use of the holy rites and all else that relates to piety is disobedient to the commandments which law and custom regularly prescribe in these matters, but rebellious or strife-stirrer is the name for him who turns aside to their direct opposite, impiety, and

<pb n="329"/>

becomes a leader in godlessness.

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="19"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="6"/> Such


was he who said, “who is He that I should obey Him,”
<note n="3.329.a">Or “who is it, whom I am to obey ?”</note>
  and again, “I know not the Lord” (Exod. v. 2). In the first of these utterances he asserts that there is no God; in the second that even if there is a God he is not known to us, and this conclusion presupposes the assumption that there is no divine providence. For if there were such a thing as providence, God too would be known.
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="20"><p><milestone unit="para"/>As for contributions or club subscriptions, when

the object is to share in the best of possessions, prudence, such payments are praiseworthy and profitable; but when they are paid to obtain that supreme evil, folly, the practice is unprofitable and blameworthy.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="21"><p> We contribute to the former object by desire for

virtue, by zeal for things noble, by continuous study therein, by persistent self-training, by unwearied and unflagging labour. We contribute to the opposite by slackness, indolence, luxury, effeminacy, and by complete irregularity of life.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="22"><p>
<note n="3.329.b">See App. p. 500.</note>
  We can see indeed

people preparing themselves to compete in the arena of wine-bibbing and every day exercising themselves and contending in the contests of gluttony. The contributions they make are supposed to be for a profitable purpose, but they are actually mulcting themselves in everything, in money, body and soul. Their substance they diminish by the actual payments, their bodily powers they shatter and enfeeble by the delicate living, and by excessive indulgence in food they deluge their souls as with a winter torrent and submerge them perforce in the depths.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="23"><p>  In just the same way those who pay their contributions

only to destroy training and education are mulcting their most vital element, the understanding,

<pb n="331"/>

and cut away therefrom its safeguards, prudence and self-control, and indeed courage and justice to boot. It was for this reason, I think, that Moses himself used a compound word, “contribution cutting,” to bring out more clearly the nature of the thing he was describing, because when men bring their efforts like contributions or club-money, so to speak, to bear against virtue, they wound and divide and cut in pieces docile and knowledge-loving souls, till they bring them to utter destruction.

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="24"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="7"/> Thus we read that the wise Abraham returned from

the “cutting”
<note n="3.331.a">κοπή, “rout,” literally is “cutting.”</note>
  of Chedorlaomer and his fellow kings (Gen. xiv. 17), while on the other hand Amalek “cuts the rearguard” of the Practiser (Deut. xxv. 18). Both these are in accordance with natural truth, for there is a hostility between opposites and they are always meditating destruction of each other.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="25"><p>  There is another charge, and that the greatest, which

could be brought against the provider of the contributions. He purposes not only to wrong, but to join with others in wrongdoing. He consents to initiate evil himself, and also to comply with what others initiate, that thus he may leave himself no ray of hope that may serve for his redemption, since his sin lies both in his nature and in what he has learnt from others. And this in spite of the direct injunction of the law, not “to go with the many to do evil” (Exod. xxiii.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="26"><p> 2). For in very truth manifold

are the aspects and the products of evil in men’s souls, while the good is narrowly confined and scanty. And so most excellent is the advice that we should not keep company with the many but with the few; for wrongdoing is the associate of the former, but right action of the latter.

<pb n="333"/>

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="27"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="8"/> The fourth and greatest charge was that of

drunkenness—and drunkenness not of the milder but of the most intense sort. For the phrase here used, “fired with wine,”
<note n="3.333.a">Philo connects -φλυγεῖν with φλέγω, though the word is rather to be connected with φλύζω, “bubble.”</note>
  is as much as to say that the poison which causes folly, indiscipline, smoulders within the man, then bursts into fire and flame impossible to quench, and consumes the soul through its whole being with the conflagration.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="28"><p> Naturally,

therefore, will punishment follow, purging every base tendency out of the mind. For it says, “thou shalt remove the evil one,” not out of a city or a country or a nation but “out of yourselves” (Deut. xxi. 21). For it is in ourselves that the vicious and culpable thoughts exist and have their lair, thoughts which we must cut away and destroy when their state is incurable.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="29"><p>  We see then this man as disobedient,

as strife-loving, as providing in the form of persuasive arguments “contributions” and “club-money” for the subversion of morality, and finally inflamed with strong drink and making drunken assaults on virtue and directing his monstrous orgies against her. Surely it were just that such a one as he should find his accusers in those in whom others find their allies, namely in his father and mother, and be visited with complete destruction, to admonish and bring to their senses those who can be saved.
<note n="3.333.b">Philo has in mind the (unquoted) conclusion of Deut. xxi. 21, “and the rest when they hear it shall fear.” <hi rend="italic">Cf.</hi>also <hi rend="italic">S.V.F.</hi>ii. 1175, where the Stoic idea of punishment as a deterrent of others is brought out.</note>

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="30"><p><milestone unit="para"/>Now “father and mother” is a phrase which can

bear different meanings.
<note n="3.333.c">Lit. “the titles are common but the meanings different.” See App. p. 500.</note>
  For instance we should rightly say and without further question that the Architect who made this universe was at the same time the father of what was thus born, whilst its mother was the knowledge possessed by its Maker.


<pb n="335"/>

With His knowledge God had union, not as men have it, and begat created being. And knowledge, having received the divine seed, when her travail was consummated bore the only beloved son who is apprehended by the senses,
<note n="3.335.a">Because there is another son not αἰσθητός, i.e. the νοητὸς κόσμος, <hi rend="italic">cf. Quod Deus</hi> 31.</note>
  the world which we see.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="31"><p> Thus

in the pages of one of the inspired company, wisdom is represented as speaking of herself after this manner: “God obtained
<note n="3.335.b">See App. p. 501.</note>
  me first of all his works and founded me before the ages” (Prov. viii. 22). True, for it was necessary that all that came to the birth of creation should be younger than the mother and nurse of the All.

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="32"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="9"/> If <hi rend="italic">these</hi> parents accuse, who

is able to withstand their accusation, or even a mild threat or the lightest chiding? Why, even their gifts are so boundless in number that no one, not even, one may say, the world, can contain them, but like some small cistern it wall quickly be filled to the brim by the influx from the fountain of God’s gracious boons, and discharge the rest in an overflow. And if we are unable to contain their benefits, how shall we endure the visitation of their powers to chastise?</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="33"><p>  But in the present discussion,


we must leave out of consideration the parents of the universe, and rather turn our eyes to the disciples, who have followed in their company,
<note n="3.335.b">See App. p. 501.</note>
  to whom has been committed the care and guidance of such souls as are not without training or incapable of culture. I suggest, then, that the father is reason, masculine, perfect, right reason and the mother the lower learning of the schools, with its regular course or round of instruction. These two stand to us in the relation of parents to children, and it is good and profitable to obey them.
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="34"><p><milestone unit="para"/>Now right reason, the father, bids us follow in the



<pb n="337"/>

steps of nature and pursue truth in her naked and undisguised form. Education, the mother, bids us give ear to rules laid down by human ordinance, rules which have been made in different cities and countries and nations by those who first embraced the apparent
<note n="3.337.a">Or “opinion.”</note>
  in preference to the true.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="35"><p> These

parents have four classes of children. The first is obedient to both; the second is the direct opposite, and gives heed to neither, while each of the other two lacks its half. One of them is heartily devoted to the father and gives ear to him, but disregards the mother and her injunctions. The other, on the contrary, appears devoted to the mother, and serves her in every way, but pays no heed to the words of the father. Of these four the first will carry off the palm of victory over all comers, while the second its opposite will receive defeat accompanied by destruction. Each of the others will claim a prize, one the second, the other the third; the second belongs to the class which obeys the father, the third to the class which obeys the mother.

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="36"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="10"/>
<note n="3.337.b">See App. p. 501.</note>
 This last kind which loves the mother, which

bows down to the opinions of the multitude and undergoes all manner of transformations in conformity with the ever-varying aspirations of human life, like the Egyptian Proteus, whose true form remained a matter of uncertainty through his power to become everything in the universe, is most clearly typified by Jethro. Jethro is a compound of vanity, closely corresponding with a city or commonwealth peopled by a promiscuous horde, who swing to and fro as their idle opinions carry them.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="37"><p> See how he deals

with Moses. He in his wisdom was recalling the whole people of the soul to piety and to honouring

<pb n="339"/>

God, and was teaching them the commandments and holy laws. His words are, “when they have a dispute and come to me, I judge between each of them and instruct them in the commandments of God and His law” (Exod. xviii. 16). And then comes forward Jethro the seeming wise, who has never learnt the secrets of the divine blessings, but his concern has been with little else than things human and corruptible. He plays the demagogue, and the laws which he lays down contradict the laws of nature; for his eyes are fixed on semblance, while they relate to real existence.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="38"><p> Yet even on him Moses has compassion,

and pities him for his great delusion; he feels that he should teach him a better lesson, and persuade him to depart from his empty opinions and follow truth stedfastly.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="39"><p> We have “removed,”
<note n="3.339.a">The LXX has ἐξαίρομεν ἡμεῖς εἰς τὸν τόπον ὃν εἶπε Κύριος, where ἐξαίρω, as often, is used intransitively. Philo, however, for his allegory uses it transitively. The English “remove” gives the double usage.</note>
  he

says in effect, and excised from the mind its empty vanity and are passing over to the place of knowledge, which is ours through the oracles and promises of God. “Come with us and we will do thee good”
(Num. x. 29). For you will lose the most harmful of evils, mere seeming, and gain the most profitable of blessings, truth.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="40"><p> But even to words of such charm

as these Jethro will pay no heed, nor ever follow knowledge in any way, but will hasten to return to the empty vanity which is indeed his own. For we read that he said to Moses, “I will not go, but I will go to my land and my generation” (Num. x. 30); that is, to the unfaith of false opinion which is his kinsman, since he has not learnt the true faith, so dear to real men.

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="41"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="11"/> For when he


wishes to make a shew of piety and says “now I



<pb n="341"/>

know that the Lord is great beyond all the gods” (Exod. xviii. 11), he does but charge himself with impiety in the eyes of men who knew how to judge. They will say to him “Blasphemer!</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="42"><p> is it now that

you know this, and have you never till now understood the greatness of the ruler of all? Did your past experience shew you anything more ancient or more venerable than God? Are not the excellences of the parents known to the children, before those of any others? Is not the Maker and Father of the Universe He who presided at its beginning?
<note n="3.341.a">See App. p. 501.</note>
  So if you say that you now know, not even now have you true knowledge, since it does not date from the beginning of your own existence.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="43"><p> And you stand no less
<note n="3.341.b">Or “notwithstanding (all your professions)”; cf. the use of οὐχ ἧττον in § 64 and § 195.</note>
  convicted

of mere feigning, when you compare two incomparables,
and say that you know that the greatness of the Existent is beyond all the Gods. For if you had true knowledge of that which IS, you would not have supposed that any other god had power of his own.”</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="47"><p> Such

a one is called by the lawgiver Laban, who, being blind to the true laws of nature, proclaims with false lips man-made law. “It is not so in our place,” he says, “to give the younger in marriage before the elder “(Gen. xxix. 26).
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="48"><p>
For Laban thinks that he

should maintain the order of time. He holds that older things should first be taken into our company, and younger things only later. But the Practiser of Wisdom, knowing that the timeless also exists in nature,
<note n="3.343.a">See App. p. 501.</note>
  desires what is younger first and the elder afterwards.  And the laws of human character
<note n="3.343.a">See App. p. 501.</note>
  as well as of nature agree with him in this; for Men of Practice must first take up with the younger culture, that afterwards they may be able to have secure enjoyment of that which is more perfect.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="49"><p> And therefore to this day the lovers of true

nobility do not attend at the door of the elder sister, philosophy, till they have taken knowledge of the younger sisters, grammar and geometry and the whole range of the school culture. For these ever secure the favours of wisdom to those who woo her in guilelessness and sincerity.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="50"><p> But Laban with his sophistry

will have it otherwise, and wishes us to wed the elder first, not that we may possess her in security, but that afterwards snared by the love-charms of the younger sister, we may abandon our desire of the elder.

to many who have left the right path

  in their search for culture. For from the very cradle, we may say,

<pb n="345"/>

they betake themselves to the most perfect of studies, philosophy, and afterwards deeming it wrong that they should have no tincture at all of the school subjects, bethink themselves to make a belated and painful effort to grasp them. And then having made their descent from the greater and older branch, philosophy, to the contemplation of the lesser and younger branches, they grow old in their company and thus lose all power of retracing their course to the place from which they started.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="52"><p>  And


this, I think, is why Laban says, “bring to a consummation her week” (Gen. xxix. 27), meaning “let not the true good of the soul be thine unendingly, but let it have its term and limit, that so you may keep company with the younger order of goods in which are classed bodily beauty and glory and riches and the like.”</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="53"><p> But Jacob does not promise to bring

her to a consummation, but agrees to “fulfil” (Gen. xxix. 28) her, that is never to cease pursuing what tends to her growth and completeness and always and everywhere to cleave to her, however great be the host of influences which draw and pull him in the opposite direction.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="54"><p>  That the rule of


custom is followed by women more than men is, I think, quite clearly shewn by the words of Rachel, who looks with admiration only on that which is perceived by the senses. For she says to her father,
“Be not wroth, sir; I cannot rise before thee, because the custom of women is upon me” (Gen. xxxi.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="55"><p> 35). So we see that obedience to custom is the

special property of women. Indeed, custom is the rule of the weaker and more effeminate soul. For nature is of men, and to follow nature is the mark of a strong and truly masculine reason.

Then it was that the oracles rang out their proclamation,
“Thy name shall not be called Jacob, but Israel shall be thy name, because thou hast been strong with God and mighty with men” (Gen. xxxii. 28).

is sometimes at rest, at other times is subject to impulses or, as we may call them, ill-timed outcries. When these are still we have profound peace, when it is otherwise we have relentless wars.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="98"><p> To this

there can be no testimony so certain as that of personal experience. Such a person hears the voice of the people shouting and says to the one who watches and observes the course of events,
<note n="3.369.a">See App. p. 503.</note>
  “There is a voice of war in the camp.” For so long as the unreasoning impulses did not stir and “shout” within us, the



<pb n="371"/>

mind stood firm and stedfast. But when they begin to fill the region of the soul with manifold sounds and voices, when they summon the passions and rouse them to action, they create the discord of civil war.  “The war is in the camp.”</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="99"><p> True


indeed. For where else do we find contentions, combats, hostilities and all the works that go with bitter and persistent war, but in the life of the body which in his parable he calls the camp? That camp the mind is wont to leave, when, filled with the divine, it finds itself in the presence of the Existent Himself and contemplates the incorporeal ideas.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="100"><p> For


“Moses,” we read, “took his tent and pitched it outside the camp,” not near, but very far, “at a distance from the camp” (Exod. xxxiii. 7). Under this figure he suggests that the Sage is a pilgrim who travels from peace to war, and from the camp of mortality and confusion to the divine life of peace where strife is not, the life of reasonable and happy souls.

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="101"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="26"/> Elsewhere he says “When


I have gone out of the city I will spread out my hands to the Lord and the sounds shall cease” (Exod. ix. 29). Do not suppose that the person who speaks thus in a man—this compound animal in which soul and body are woven or twined or mingled (use any word you will). No, it is the mind pure and unalloyed. While it is cooped up in the city of the body and mortal life, it is cabined and cribbed and like a prisoner in the gaol declares roundly that it cannot even draw a breath of free air; but when it has gone out of this city, its thoughts and reflections are at liberty, like the hands and feet of the unbound prisoner, and it finds free scope and range for the employment of its active powers, so that the

<pb n="373"/>

clamours of the passions are at once restrained.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="102"><p> How shrill are the outcries of pleasure, wherewith

it is wont to command what it wills! How continuous is the voice of desire, when it thunders forth its threats against those who do not minister to its wants! How full-toned and sonorous is the call of each of the other passions!</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="103"><p> Yet though each of

them should have a thousand tongues and mouths with which to swell the war-shout, to use the poet’s phrase, yet it could not confuse the ears of the perfect Sage, who has passed elsewhere and resolved no longer to dwell in the same city as they.

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="104"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="27"/> When the subject of that experience says

that he feels that in the camp of the body all the sounds are sounds of war, and that the quietness which is so dear to peace has been driven far away, the holy word does not dissent. For it does not say that the sound is not the sound of war but that it is not such a sound as some think it to be, such as would be made by the victorious or the defeated, but such as would proceed from those who are overpressed and weighed down by wine.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="105"><p> For in the phrase “it is not the sound

of those who raise the song through might” the last words mean “those who have been victorious in war.”
For might is what causes victory.  Thus
wise Abraham, when he had routed the nine kings, the four passions that is and the five sense-faculties, which were rising in unnatural rebellion, is represented as raising the hymn of thanksgiving in these words, “I will stretch forth my hand to the most high God who made heaven and earth, if I will take from a rope to a shoe’s latchet of all that is thine” (Gen. xiv.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="106"><p> 22, 23). He points in these last words, I

think, to the whole of creation, heaven, earth, water,

<pb n="375"/>

the air we breathe, to animals and plants alike. To each of them he who has braced the activities of his own soul to stretch Godwards, and who hopes for help from Him alone, would rightly say, “I will take nothing from aught of thy creatures, not the light of day from the sun, nor the light of night from the moon and the other stars, nor rain from the air or the clouds, nor drink and food from water and earth, nor sight from the eyes, nor hearing from the ears, nor smell from the nostrils, nor taste from the juices of the palate, nor speech from the tongue, nor giving and receiving from the hands, nor moving forwards and backwards from the feet, nor respiration from the lungs, nor digestion from the liver, nor from the other inward parts the functions proper to each, nor their yearly fruits from the trees and seedlings, but I will take them all from the only wise Being who has extended His beneficent power every whither, and through them renders me help.”

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="107"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="28"/> He then

who has the vision of the Existent knows Him who is the Cause, and honours the things of which He is the cause only as second to Him. He will use no words of flattery, yet acknowledges what is their due. This acknowledgement is most just. I will take nothing <hi rend="italic">from</hi> you, but I will take from God, the possessor of all things; yet it may be that I will take <hi rend="italic">through</hi> you, for you have been made instruments to minister to His undying acts of grace.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="108"><p> But the man

of no discernment, whose understanding, by which alone the Existent can be comprehended, is blinded, has never anywhere seen that Existence, but only the material contents of this world as shewn to him by his senses, and these material things he believes to be the causes of all that comes into being.

<pb n="377"/>

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="109"><p>And therefore he started fashioning gods and filled

the inhabited world with idols of stone and wood and numberless other figures wrought in various materials, and decreed great prizes and magnificent honours public and private to painters and sculptors, whom the lawgiver had banished from the boundaries of his commonwealth. He expected to produce piety; what he accomplished was its opposite, impiety.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="110"><p> For polytheism creates atheism in the souls of the

foolish, and God’s honour is set at naught by those who deify the mortal. For it did not content them to fashion images of sun or moon, or, if they would have it so, of all the earth and all the water, but they even allowed irrational plants and animals to share the honour which belongs to things imperishable. Such persons did Abraham rebuke and we shewed that it was with this thought that he raised his hymn of victory.

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="111"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="29"/> So, too, with the song


of Moses. He has seen the king of Egypt, the boastful mind with his six hundred
<note n="3.377.a">In Philo’s elastic philosophy of numbers 600 easily=6. For the six movements see <hi rend="italic">Leg. All.</hi> i. 4.</note>
  chariots (Exod. xiv. 7), that is the six movements of the organic body, adjusted for the use of the princes who ride upon them (Exod. xv. 4) who, though no created object can be stable, think it right to aver that all such are firmly established and unsusceptible of change. He has seen that mind suffer the penalty due to its impiety while the Votary of Practice has escaped the onset of his enemies and been brought with might to unlooked-for safety. So then he hymns God the righteous and true dispenser of events and the song which he raises is most fitting and suited to the occasion. “The horse and his rider He has thrown into the sea” (Exod. xv. 1), that is, He has buried

<pb n="379"/>

out of sight the mind which rode upon the unreasoning impulses of passion, that four-footed beast which knows not the rein, and has shewn Himself the helper and champion of the soul which can see, to bestow on it full salvation.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="112"><p> Again Moses


leads the song at the well, and this time his theme is not only the rout of the passions, but the strength invincible which can win that most beautiful of possessions, wisdom, which he likens to a well. For wisdom lies deep below the surface and gives forth a sweet stream of true nobility for thirsty souls, and that draught is at once needful and delicious above all things.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="113"><p> But to none of those who in instruction

are but of the common herd is it permitted to dig this well, only to kings, as he says “kings hewed it” (Num. xxi. 16–18).
<note n="3.379.a">See App. p. 503.</note>
  For it belongs to great leaders to search for and accomplish wisdom, not leaders who have subdued sea and land with arms, but those who through the powers of the soul have conquered the medley and confusion of the multitude which beset it.

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="114"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="30"/>
<note n="3.379.b">See App. p. 504.</note>
  These leaders prove to have


followers and disciples
<note n="3.379.b">See App. p. 504.</note>
  in those who say “thy servants have taken the sum of the warriors who were with us. Not one of them is in discord. We have brought our gift to the Lord, every man what he found” (Num. xxxi.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="115"><p> 49, 50). It would seem that

these too are raising a song of victory in their desire for the perfect powers that befit the leaders. For they say that they have taken the largest number, that which completes the sum, of the different aspects of courage. They are by nature combatants, marshalled to fight against two battalions
<note n="3.379.b">See App. p. 504.</note>
  of the enemy, one led by cowardice, a quality so difficult to cure, the other by rashness inspired by the frenzy of battle,

<pb n="381"/>

and neither has any element of good judgement.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="116"><p> Now it is a fine saying that “none is at discord” or

thus failing to partake of courage perfect and complete. For as the lyre or any musical instrument is out of harmony if even a single note and nothing more be out of tune, but in harmony when, under a single stroke of the bow, the strings join in yielding the same symphony, so it is with the instrument of the soul. It is out of harmony when it is strained too far by rashness and forced to the highest pitch of the scale, or when it is relaxed too much by cowardice and weakened to the lowest. It is in harmony when all the strings of courage and every virtue combine to produce a single tuneful melody.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="117"><p> The harmony and

tunefulness in this case is mightily attested by the words which say that they have offered their gift to God, that is, that they have duly honoured the Existent by clearly acknowledging that this universe

is His gift.
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="118"><p>
For it says in words most agreeable to the truth of things, “what a man found, this he offered as a gift.”</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="119"><p> Each of us, that is, finds at our birth that great gift of God, the complete universe which He bestowed on itself and on its highest

members.

<milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="31"/> There are also partial
and particular gifts which it is fitting for God to give and for man to receive. These we shall find are the virtues and the activities which correspond to them.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="120"><p> Our discovery of them one may almost say is timeless, because of the exceeding swiftness with which the Donor bestows His wonted gifts to the amazement of all, even of those who find nothing great in other

things. Thus Isaac asks, “what is this which thou



<pb n="383"/>

hast found quickly, my son?” marvelling at the speed with which the virtuous disposition has been attained. The receiver of God’s benefit answered rightly, “it is what the Lord God delivered to me”
(Gen. xxvii. 20). For the instructions and injunctions delivered through men are slow, but those that come through God are exceeding swift, outrunning even the swiftest movement of time.
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="121"><p><milestone unit="para"/>Now those described above are those who lead the

song of prevailing might, the precentors of the choir which sings the hymn of victory and thanksgiving, while they who raise the song of weakness and defeat,
<note n="3.383.a">Between ἀσθένειαν and τοῦ understand ἔξαρχοι καὶ ἡγεμόνες.</note>
  leaders of the choir which sobs forth the wailing of the routed, are of another sort, men who deserve pity rather than reproaches, even as we pity those whose bodies are fatally stricken by nature, with whom the misfortune of their malady ever stands to prevent their finding health and safety.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="122"><p>
<note n="3.383.b">Or “with whom any trifling occasion of sickness is a mighty obstacle to their well-being.”</note>
   But some

  have failed not involuntarily, not because

the nerves of their souls were feebler and because they were overpressed by the stouter might of their opponents, but because imitating those who hug their chains, they have voluntarily laid themselves at the feet of cruel masters, though they were born to freedom. And since in virtue of their free birth they could not be sold, they have—strange contrast—purchased and taken to them masters. Thus they are on a level with those who swill themselves insatiably with wine to the pitch of intoxication.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="123"><p> For such deliberately

and under no compulsion put the cup of strong drink to their lips, and so it is also with full deliberation that these men eliminate soberness from their soul and choose madness in its place. For so runs the text, “It is the voice of those who raise

<pb n="385"/>

the song of wine that I hear,” that is, not the song of those on whom insanity has fallen through no will of their own, but of those who are possessed with the frenzy which they themselves have willed.

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="124"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="32"/> Now everyone who comes near to the camp


“sees the calf and the dance” (Exod. xxxii. 19), as Moses himself shews. For all of us who have the deliberate purpose to stand close to the camp of the body find themselves in the company of vanity and its band of revellers. Whereas those who yearn for the Vision and long to behold things incorporeal are practisers of simplicity, and therefore it is their custom to make their dwelling as far as may be from the body.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="125"><p> | Pray then to God that thou


mayest never become a leader in the wine song, never, that is, voluntarily take the first steps on the path which leads to indiscipline and folly. Voluntarily, I say, for involuntary evils are but half evils and lighter matters, since they have not upon them the sheer
<note n="3.385.a">The translation takes καθαρός in the sense of “unmixed,” i.e. with nothing to lighten its force. Possibly “in all its purity.”</note>
  weight of convicting conscience.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="126"><p> But if thy

prayers are fulfilled thou canst no longer remain a layman, but wilt obtain the office which is the greatest of headships, the priesthood. | For it is the task of priests and ministers of God alone, or of hardly any others, to make the offering of sobriety, and in stedfastness of mind to resist the wine-cup and everything which causes folly.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="127"><p> For


‘the Lord spake unto Aaron,” we read, “saying, Wine and strong liquor ye shall not drink, thou and thy sons after thee, whenever ye enter into the tabernacle of testimony, or approach the altar, and ye shall not die. It is an everlasting ordinance unto your generations, to make a difference between the holy and the profane and between the clean and the unclean”

<pb n="387"/>

(Lev. x.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="128"><p> 8–10).  Now Aaron is the


priest and his name means “mountainous.’’ He is the reason whose thoughts are lofty and sublime, not with the empty inflated bigness of mere vaunting, but with the greatness of virtue, which lifts his thinking above the heaven and will not let him cherish any reasoning that is mean and low. And being so minded he will never willingly allow strong wine or any potion which breeds folly to approach him.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="129"><p> For

he must either himself enter the tabernacle in mystic procession to accomplish the unseen rites, or come to the altar and there offer sacrifices of thanksgiving for private and public blessings. And these need sober abstinence and a close and ready attention.

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="130"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="33"/> In a literal sense too, this

command deserves our admiration. For surely it is seemly that men should come to prayers and holy services sober and with full control of themselves, just as on the other hand to come with both body and soul relaxed with wine is a matter for scorn and ridicule.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="131"><p> We know that when servants are about

to approach their masters, or sons their parents, or subjects their rulers, they will take careful thought to be sober that they may not transgress in word and deed, and thus either receive punishment for having shewn contempt for the dignity of their betters, or at the best become an object of scorn. And shall he who claims to serve the Lord and Father of all, instead of rising superior to food and drink and all other natural necessities, fall away to luxury and affect the life of the dissolute? Shall he, with his eyes heavy with wine and his head lolling and his neck bent awry, come belching from his intemperance, limp and flabby in every limb, to touch the holy water or the altars or

<pb n="389"/>

the sacrifices? Nay, for such a one it were a sacrilege that he should even from a distance behold the sacred fire.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="132"><p>   But if we suppose that no actual

tabernacle or altar is meant, that is the visible objects fashioned from lifeless and perishable material, but those invisible conceptions perceived only by the mind, of which the others are copies
<note n="3.389.a">See App. p. 504.</note>
  open to our senses, he will be still more lost in admiration at the ordinance.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="133"><p> For since the Creator made both the

pattern and the copy in all that He made, virtue was not excepted: He wrought its archetypal seal, and He also stamped with this an impression which was its close counterpart. The archetypal seal is an incorporeal idea, but the copy which is made by the impression is something else—a material something, naturally perceptible by the senses, yet not actually coming into relation with them; just as we might say that a piece of wood buried in the deepest part of the Atlantic ocean has a natural capacity for being burnt, though actually it will never be consumed by fire because the sea is around and above it.

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="134"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="34"/>
<note n="3.389.a">See App. p. 504.</note>
 Let us conceive, then, of the tabernacle

and altar as “ideas,” the first being a symbol of incorporeal virtue, the other of its sensible image. Now the altar and what is on it can be easily seen. For it is constructed out of doors, and the fire which consumes the offerings is never extinguished,
<note n="3.389.b">The lacuna in the text may be filled up with some such words as τὰ ἱερουργούμενα.</note>
  and thus by night as well as by day it is in bright light.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="135"><p> But the tabernacle and all its contents are unseen,

not only because they are placed right inside and in the heart of the sanctuary, but because anyone who touched them, or with a too curious eye looked upon them, was punished with death according to the

<pb n="391"/>

ordinance of the law, and against that sentence there was no appeal. The only exception made is for one who should be free from all defects, not wasting himself with any passion great or small, but endowed with a nature sound and complete and perfect in every respect.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="136"><p> To him it is permitted to enter once

a year and behold the sights which are forbidden to others, because in him alone of all resides the winged and heavenly yearning for those forms of good which are incorporeal and imperishable.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="137"><p> And so, when

smitten by its ideal beauty he follows that archetype which creates by impress the particular virtues, beholding with ecstasy its most divine loveliness, or when he approaches some virtue which has received its impress, ignorance and the condition of the uninstructed are forgotten, and knowledge and instruction are at once remembered.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="138"><p>  And therefore

he says “Wine and strong liquor ye shall not drink, thou and thy sons after thee, when ye enter into the tabernacle of testimony or approach the altar.” In these words he speaks not so much by way of prohibition as stating what he thinks will happen. If a prohibition were intended, it would have been natural to say “do not drink wine when you perform the rites”; the phrase “you shall not” or
“will not” drink is naturally used, when the speaker is stating what he thinks. For it is impossible that anyone, whose study and association lie among the general and specific virtues, should let indiscipline, which is the cause of drunkenness and the symptoms which follow it in the soul, have entry to him.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="139"><p>  And he frequently calls the tabernacle “the tabernacle

of testimony,” either because God who cannot lie gives His testimony to virtue, a testimony to

<pb n="393"/>

which it is excellent and profitable to give ear, or because virtue implants constancy in the souls of men, eradicating with a strong hand the reasonings which doubt and waver, and thus witness-like revealing the truth in the court of human life.

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="140"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="35"/> Again, he says that he whose offerings are

wineless shall not even die; meaning that instruction entails immortality, but its absence entails death. For as in our bodies disease is the cause of dissolution, while health preserves them, so in our souls the preserving element is prudence, which is, so to speak, mental health, while the destroying element is folly inflicting incurable malady.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="141"><p>  This, he says,


is “an eternal statute,” and the words mean what they say.
<note n="3.393.a">Lit. “declaring (his opinion) outright.” The thought seems to be that we may learn from the words not only that this particular law is eternal, but that all law in the true sense is necessarily (εὐθύς) so.</note>
  For he does hold that there is a deathless law engraved in the nature of the universe which lays down this truth, that instruction is a thing which gives health and safety, while its absence is the cause of disease and destruction.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="142"><p> But there is also a

further explanation in the words to this effect. A statute which is law in the true sense is thereby eternal, since right reason, which is identical with law,
<note n="3.393.b">See App. p. 505.</note>
  is not destructible; for that its opposite, the unlawful, is ephemeral and of itself subject to dissolution is a truth acknowledged by men of good sense.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="143"><p>  Again, it is the special task of law


and instruction to “distinguish” the profane from the sacred and the impure from the pure, just as conversely it is the way of lawlessness and indiscipline to mix and confuse everything and thus force under the same head things which are in conflict with each other.

<pb n="395"/>

<milestone unit="altchapter" n="36"/> Therefore Samuel too, the greatest of kings
<note n="3.395.a">In what sense is Samuel a king? Perhaps as the hero of the First Book of Kings and the king-maker.</note>
  and prophets, “will never,” as the scripture tells us,
“drink wine or intoxicating liquor till his dying day” (1 Sam. i. 11).
<note n="3.395.b">So the LXX. The words οἶνον καὶ μέθυσμα οὐ πίεται have nothing corresponding to them in the Hebrew.</note>
  For his place has been ordered in the ranks of the divine army, and through the providence of the wise commander he will never leave it.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="144"><p> Now

probably there was an actual man called Samuel; but we conceive of the Samuel of the scripture, not as a living compound of soul and body, but as a mind which rejoices in the service and worship of God and that only. For his name by interpretation means
“appointed or ordered to God,” because he thinks that all actions that are based on idle opinions are grievous disorder.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="145"><p>  His mother is Hannah,


whose name means in our language “grace.” For without divine grace it is impossible either to leave the ranks of mortality, or to stay for ever among the immortal.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="146"><p> Now when grace fills the soul, that

soul thereby rejoices and smiles and dances, for it is possessed and inspired, so that to many of the unenlightened it may seem to be drunken, crazy and beside itself. And therefore she is addressed by a
“boy,”
<note n="3.395.c">So the LXX. In the Hebrew the words are spoken by Eli.</note>
  not meaning a single boy, but everyone whose age is ripe for restlessness and defiance and mockery of excellence, in these words: “How long wilt thou be drunken? put away thy wine from thee” (1 Sam. i.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="147"><p> 14). For with the God-possessed not only

is the soul wont to be stirred and goaded as it were into ecstasy but the body also is flushed and fiery, warmed by the overflowing joy within which passes on the sensation to the outer man, and thus many of the foolish are deceived and suppose that the sober

are drunk.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="148"><p>  Though, indeed, it is true


that these sober ones are drunk in a sense, for all good things are united in the strong wine on which they feast, and they receive the loving-cup from perfect virtue; while those others who are drunk with the drunkenness of wine have lived fasting from prudence without ceasing, and no taste of it has come to their famine-stricken lips.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="149"><p> Fitly, then, does she answer

the reckless one who thinks to mock her stern and austere life, Sirrah, “I a woman am the hard day,
<note n="3.397.a">Or, as Philo may have understood the words, “hard and easy,” taking ἡμέρα from ἥμερος, see App. p. 505. The E.V. has “of a sorrowful spirit.”</note>
  I have drunk no wine or strong drink, and I will pour out my soul before the Lord” (1 Sam. i. 15). How vast is the boldness of the soul which is filled with the gracious gifts of God!</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="150"><p> First, we see, she

calls herself a “hard day,” taking the view of the varlet who thought to make a mock of her, for to him and to every fool the way to virtue seems rough and painful and ill to tread, and to this one of the old writers has testified in these words:
<quote>
<l>Vice you may take by squadrons; but there lies</l>
<l>’Twixt you and virtue (so hath God ordained)</l>
<l>Sore travail. Long and steep the road to her,</l>

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="151"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="37"/> Secondly, she declares that she

has not partaken of wine or strong liquor, glorying that her whole life has been one of unbroken abstinence. And rightly, for indeed it was a great and wonderful feat to follow reason, the free, the unshackled, the pure, which no passion inebriates.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="152"><p> And



<pb n="399"/>

the result of this is that the mind, which has drunk deep of abstinence unmixed, becomes a libation in its whole being, a libation which is poured out to God. What else was meant by the words, “I will pour out my soul before the Lord” but “I will consecrate it all to him, I will loosen all the chains that bound it tight, which the empty aims and desires of mortal life had fastened upon it; I will send it abroad, extend and diffuse it, so that it shall touch the bounds of the All, and hasten to that most glorious and loveliest of visions—the Vision of the Uncreated”?

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="153"><p><milestone unit="para"/>This, then, is the company of the sober who have

set before them instruction as their head, while the former was the company of the drunken, whose leader was indiscipline.

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="154"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="38"/> But drunkenness,


we saw, does not only signify folly, which is the work of this rejection of discipline, but it also signifies complete insensibility. In the body this is produced by wine, but in the soul by ignorance of things of which we should naturally have acquired knowledge. Consequently on the subject of ignorance I must say a few words, only just what is needful, by way of reminder. Now what we call ignorance is an affection of the soul.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="155"><p> To what affection

of the body can we liken it, but to the incapacitation of the sense-organs? All who have lost the use of eyes and ears can no longer see or hear and have no knowledge of day and light, which alone in truth make life desirable, but are surrounded by enduring darkness and everlasting night, thus rendered helpless in regard to every issue great or small. These persons are in common life generally and with good reason called “incapable.”</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="156"><p> For even if all the

faculties of the rest of the body should attain the

<pb n="401"/>

utmost limit of strength and capacity, yet if they are handicapped by the crippling of eyes and ears they fall, and great is that fall, making any reinstatement impossible. For, though we speak of the feet as the support which upholds the man, in reality that is done by the faculties of sight and hearing: possessed of these in their fullness, the man stands uprisen and erect; deprived of them, he gives way and is utterly prostrated.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="157"><p>  An exactly similar result in


the soul is produced by ignorance, which destroys its powers of seeing and hearing, and suffers neither light, which might shew it realities, nor reason,
<note n="3.401.a">Or “word . . . wordlessness.” See App. p. 505.</note>
  which might be its teacher, to find their way in; but sheds about it profound darkness and a flood of unreason,
<note n="3.401.a">Or “word . . . wordlessness.” See App. p. 505.</note>
  and turns the soul’s fair and lovely form into a senseless block of stone.

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="158"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="39"/> Similarly knowledge,

the opposite of ignorance, may be called the eyes and the ears of the soul. For it fixes the attention on what is said and contemplates what is, and allows no mis-seeing or mis-hearing,
<note n="3.401.b">See App. p. 505.</note>
  but surveys and observes all that is worthy to be heard and seen. And if it be necessary to travel or take ship, it makes its way to the ends of the earth or ocean, to see something more or hear something new.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="159"><p> For nothing

is so active as the passion for knowledge; it hates sleep and loves wakefulness. So it ever arouses and excites and sharpens the intellect, and compelling it to range in every direction makes it greedy to hear, and instils an incessant thirst for learning.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="160"><p>  Knowledge, then, provides
<note n="3.401.c">Or “ preserves.”</note>
  that sight or hearing, to

which we owe each case of right conduct. For he who sees and hears in the moral sense, knows what is good for him, and by choosing this and rejecting




<pb n="403"/>

its opposite, finds himself benefited. But ignorance entails a more severe disablement to the soul than the disablement of the body, and thus is the cause of all its wrongdoing, since it cannot draw help from outside itself through the warnings which seeing and hearing might give it. Thus, standing utterly alone, and left unguarded and unprotected, it is a butt for the haphazard hostility of men and circumstances alike.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="161"><p> Let us, then, never drink so deep of strong

liquor as to reduce our senses to inactivity, nor become so estranged from knowledge as to spread the vast and profound darkness of ignorance over our soul.

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="162"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="40"/> Now ignorance as a whole is of two different

kinds; one single, that is complete insensibility, the other twofold, that is when a man is not merely the victim of a want of knowledge, but also, encouraged by a false idea of his own wisdom, thinks he knows what he does not know at all.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="163"><p> The former is the

lesser evil, for it is the cause of less serious and perhaps involuntary errors, and the second is the greater, for it is the parent of great iniquities, not only those which are involuntary, but such as are actually premeditated.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="164"><p>  It was this especially which

brought trouble to Lot—Lot who was the parent of daughters only and could rear no male or perfect growth within his soul. Two daughters he had and their mother was she who was turned into stone, whom we might call “custom,” if we gave her her right name; her nature is hostile to truth, and if we take her with us, she lags behind and gazes round at the old familiar objects and remains among them like a lifeless monument.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="165"><p>  The elder of these

daughters will bear the name of Deliberation, and

<pb n="405"/>

the younger of Assent. For assent follows deliberation, and no one who has given his assent continues to deliberate. The mind then taking his seat in his council begins to make his daughters busy.
<note n="3.405.a">Or “to examine.”</note>
  With the elder, Deliberation, he proceeds to discuss and examine every point; with the younger, Assent, he readily agrees to every suggestion, giving a friendly welcome to any however hostile, if what they have to give offers any enticement of pleasure however small.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="166"><p> In its sober condition the mind does not tolerate this,

only when it has succumbed to intoxication and is as though overcome by wine.

<milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="41"/> And so we read,
“They gave their father wine to drink” (Gen. xix. 33).  Now this is complete insensibility,
that the mind should think itself competent to deliberate by itself on what is to its interests, or to assent to presentations of any kind as though they were a vehicle of solid truth, for human nature is ever quite unable, either by circumspection to discover certainty, or to choose some things as true and profitable, and to reject others as false and injurious.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="167"><p> For the vastness of the darkness which overspreads

the world of bodies and affairs forbids us to see the nature of each; and though curiosity or love of learning may give us the wish to force our way and peer through the curtain, we shall like blind men stumble over the obstacles before us, lose our footing and miss our object, or if our hands do lay hold of it, we are but guessing at uncertainties and it is not truth but conjecture that is in our grasp.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="168"><p> For even

if instruction, torch in hand, should go before the mind, shedding her own particular light to give it sight of realities, it would do more harm than good. For its little beam is bound to be extinguished by

<pb n="407"/>

the vast darkness, and when it is extinguished all power of sight is useless.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="169"><p>  He who prides


himself on his judgement in deliberation, or flatters himself that he is competent to choose this and shun that, should be brought to a recollection of the truth by the following thoughts. If it were always the case that the same objects produced the same impressions on the mind without any variation, it would perhaps be necessary that the two instruments of judgement which nature has established in us, sense and mind, should be held in high esteem as veracious and incorruptible, and that we should not suspend our judgement on any point through doubt but accept a single presentation of two different objects, and on the faith of this choose one and reject the other.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="170"><p> But

since we prove to be differently affected by them at different times, we can say nothing with certainty about anything, because the picture presented to us is not constant, but subject to changes manifold and multiform.

<milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="42"/> Since the mental picture is variable, the judgement we form of it must be variable also. There are many reasons for this.

<note n="3.407.b">See App. p. 506.</note>
  there are the innumerable differences

in living creatures, differences concerned not with a single aspect, but practically with all; differences in birth, in structure and equipment; differences in food and mode of life; differences in predilections and aversions; differences in their sense-activities

  among the objects of such judgements. Take for instance the chameleon

and the polypus. The former, we are told, changes its colour and grows like the kinds of soil over which it is its habit to crawl; the latter grows like the rocks to which it clings in the sea, and we may fairly suppose that this power of changing to various colours is given them by protecting nature as a remedy against the danger of capture.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="173"><p> Again, have we not

seen the dove’s neck
<note n="3.409.a">See App. p. 506.</note>
  change in the sun’s rays into a thousand different hues, sometimes scarlet and dark blue, or fiery or like red-hot coal, again yellow and then ruddy, and all other kinds of colour, so numerous that it would be difficult to give even their names in full?</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="174"><p> Indeed it is said that in the land of the

Scythians who are known as the Geloans a most extraordinary animal is actually, though no doubt rarely, found called the elk, in size equal to an ox, but with a face shaped very like a deer. The account given of this creature is that it always changes the colour of its hair into that of the places, trees, or any imaginable thing near which it stands, and owing to this similarity of colour, we are told, it is not observed by passers-by, and this fact rather than its bodily strength makes it difficult to catch.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="175"><p> These and similar phenomena are clear proofs of the

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="176"><p> Not only do their judgements

on the same objects vary at different times, but different persons receive different impressions of pleasure or its reverse from the same things. For what is disliked by some is enjoyed by others, and contrariwise what some receive with open arms as acceptable and agreeable to their nature is utterly

scouted by others as alien and repugnant.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="177"><p> For

  Others are so unstirred that, as far as this is concerned, you might suppose them on a level of feeling with the senseless benches on which they sit. Others, again, are so repelled that they are off and away from the performance, and indeed, as they go, block their ears with both hands for fear that some echo of the music should remain to haunt them and produce a sense of discomfort to irritate and pain their souls.

 But it is needless to quote such cases as these.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="178"><p>

Every single individual in his own person is subject, extraordinary though it be, to numberless changes and variations in body and soul, and chooses at one time and rejects at another things which do not change, but retain the natural constitution which they have had throughout.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="179"><p> The same feelings are

not experienced in health as in sickness, in wakefulness as in sleep, in youth as in age. And people receive different mental impressions according as they are standing or moving, confident or affrighted, sad or joyful, loving or hating.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="180"><p> And why tediously

pursue the subject? For to put it shortly, our bodies and souls are in a state of motion, natural or unnatural, which considered as a whole produces that ceaseless change in the mental pictures presented

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="183"><p> Sometimes we

suppose lifeless objects to be living objects or the converse. And we have similar illusions about things stationary and moving, advancing and receding, short and long, circular and multilateral.

 Again, everyone knows that practically nothing at

all which exists is intelligible by itself and in itself, but everything is appreciated only by comparison with its opposite; as small by comparison with great, dry with wet, hot with cold, light with heavy, black with white, weak with strong, few with many. The same rule holds with all that concerns virtue and vice.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="187"><p> We only know the profitable through the hurtful, the

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="188"><p> Now that which is

  For instance, how do we


apprehend colours? Surely by means of the externals, air and light, and the internal moisture in the eye itself. How do we discriminate between sweet

and bitter? Can we do so without the juices in the mouth, both those which are in accord with nature
<note n="3.417.a">See App. p. 508.</note>
  and those which are not? Surely not. Again, do the odours produced by burning incense present to us the natures of the substances in a pure and simple form, or in a combination, in which themselves and air, or sometimes also the fire which dissolves the material, are joined with the faculty possessed by the nostrils?</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="191"><p> From this we deduce that we do not apprehend

But I do wonder that the multitude of so-called philosophers, who feign to be seeking for exact and absolute certainty in things, are divided into troops and companies and propound dogmatic conclusions widely different and often diametrically opposite not on some single chance point, but on practically all points great or small, which constitute the problems which they seek to solve.</p></div>

Let us turn our discussion to what follows next. We said that one thing signified by drunkenness is that gluttony
<note n="3.425.a">See App. p. 509.</note>
  whose great power for mischief is so widespread and constant, which leaves those who indulge in it, as we may see, with a void in their desires, even though they have every vacant place in their bodies filled.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="207"><p> Such persons, when glutted and satiated by the

quantities they have engorged, may for a while like weary-limbed athletes give their bodies a breathing-space,
but ere long they make themselves ready to take part in the same encounter.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="208"><p>  So we


see the King of Egypt, that is of the body, though he seemed to be angry with the cup-bearer who ministered to his drunkenness, represented in the holy books as being reconciled to him after a short time. He remembered the passion which excited his desires on his birthday—the day of his birth into a being destined to perish—not on the day of the light, which has no birth, a day which perishes not. For we are told that it was Pharaoh’s birthday (Gen. xl. 20) when he sent for the chief cup-bearer from the prison to pour the cup of reconciliation.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="209"><p>

  It is characteristic of

the friend of passion that things created and perishable seem to him bright and shining, because in relation

to knowledge of things imperishable, he dwells in night and profound darkness, and therefore at once he welcomes the drunkenness which brings pleasure in its train and him who is the minister of drunkenness.

three servants who provide its feasts, the chief baker, the chief butler and the chief cook, whom our most admirable Moses mentions in these words, “And Pharaoh was wroth with his two eunuchs, with the chief butler and the chief baker, and he put them in prison under the chief gaoler” (Gen. xl. 2, 3). But the chief cook is also a eunuch, for we have in another place, “and Joseph was brought down into Egypt and became the property of the eunuch of Pharaoh, the chief cook” (Gen. xxxix. 1), and again “they sold Joseph to the eunuch of Pharaoh, the chief cook” (Gen. xxxvii.</p></div>

Is it not because nature has trained men to sow the germs of life and women to receive them, and the mating of these two is the cause of generation and of the permanence of the All, while on the other hand it is the nature of the soul which is impotent and barren, or rather has been made so by emasculation, to delight in costly bakemeats and drinks and dishes elaborately prepared? For such a soul is neither able to drop the truly masculine seeds of virtue nor yet to receive and foster what is so dropped, but like a sorry stony field is only capable of blighting the successive growths, which were meant to live.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="212"><p> In fact we have a doctrine laid down

most profitable to us all, that every craftsman whose work is to produce pleasure can produce no fruit of wisdom. He is neither male nor female, for he is incapable

of either giving or receiving the seeds whence spring the growth that perishes not, and the base craft he practises is aimed against human life. He destroys the indestructible and quenches the unquenchable ever-abiding lamps of nature.</p></div>

such does Moses permit to enter the congregation of God, for he says, “He who has lost the organs of generation

  shall not come into the congregation of the Lord” (Deut. xxiii. 1).

<milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="52"/> For what use can he find in listening to holy words, who can beget no offspring of wisdom, when the knife has cut away the power of faith, and the store of truths which might best profit human life he cannot keep in his charge?</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="214"><p>  Now mankind, as we have seen, has

three caterers, the baker, the cup-bearer and the cook. This is natural enough since we desire the use and enjoyment of these three things, bread, flesh and drink. But some desire only the bare necessities, the use of which is needed to keep life from being unhealthy and sordid; while others seek them in luxurious forms, which excite the cravings of the appetite, and in extravagant quantities, which oppress and overload the receptacles of the body, and often produce grave disorders of every kind.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="215"><p> The first of

these classes who are not specialists in pleasure or voluptuousness or passion are like the ordinary public in a city who live an inoffensive and innocuous life, who have few wants and therefore do not require versatile and highly-skilled artists to serve them, but only those who attempt no more than a plain and simple form of service, just cooks, cup-bearers and bakers.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="216"><p> But the second class, holding that pleasant

living is sovereignty and kingship, and judging all things great and small by this standard, consider it

their due to employ chief cooks, chief butlers, chief bakers, that is those who have worked up to a high pitch of refinement the arts which they severally profess.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="217"><p>  Milk cakes, honey cakes, numberless


other kinds of bakemeats in the greatest possible variety, elaborately calculated to beguile the eye as well as the palate, not only with diversities of material, but also by the way in which the constituents are proportioned and the shapes in which they appear, engage the care and attention of the master-hands in confectionery.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="218"><p>  As for wine, whether


it is such as is quickly digested and leaves no headache, whether on the other hand it has a fine bouquet

  and fragrance, whether it needs a small or great dilution to fit it for a fierce and heated carousal or a mild and quiet festivity, these and all such questions are the study of chief butlers, who have reached the very summit of their art.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="219"><p>  Again, the


skilful dressing and preparation of fishes, birds and the like, and the flavouring of other savoury dishes, is a task readily accomplished by highly scientific professionals, whose constant drill and practice in catering for the life, which all its voluptuous luxury cannot make worth living, has given them the ingenuity to invent hundreds of other delicacies besides those which they have seen and heard of.

shewn to be eunuchs and unable to beget wisdom, it was the butler with whom the mind, whose kingdom is the belly, made his compact of peace. For the passion for wine is extraordinarily strong in mankind, and is unique in this, that it does not produce satiety. For whereas everyone is satisfied with a certain amount of sleep and food and sexual intercourse and

the like, this is rarely so with strong drink, particularly among practised topers.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="221"><p> They drink but do not

slake their thirst and, while they begin with smaller cups, as they advance they call for the wine to be poured in larger goblets. And when they get mellow and well warmed, they lose all control of themselves, and put beakers and cans and whole basins to their lips and drain them at a draught until either they are overcome with deep sleep, or the influx of the liquor fills up the cavities

  and overflows.  </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="222"><p>
But
even then the insatiable craving within them rages

as if it were still starving. “For their vine is of the vine of Sodom,” as Moses says, “and their tendrils of Gomorrah, their grapes are grapes of gall, a cluster of bitterness to them. Their wine is the wrath of dragons and the incurable wrath of asps” (Deut. xxxii. 32, 33). Sodom is indeed by interpretation barrenness and blindness, and Moses here likens to a vine and its produce those who are under the thrall of wine-bibbing and gluttony and the basest of pleasures.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="223"><p>  His inner meaning is of


this kind. No plant of true gladness grows in the soul of the wicked, since it has no healthy roots, but such as were burnt to ashes, when God passed well-deserved
sentence upon the impious, and the heavens rained instead of water the unquenchable flames of the thunderbolt. In such a soul all that grows is the lust which is barren of excellence, and blinded to all that is worthy of its contemplation, and this lust he compares to a vine; not that which is the mother of kindly fruits, but a vine which proves to be the bearer of bitterness and wickedness and villainy and wrath and anger and savage moods and tempers, the


<pb n="435"/>

vine which stings the soul like vipers and venomous asps, and that sting none can cure.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="224"><p>  Let


us pray that these may be averted, and implore the all-merciful God to destroy this wild vine and decree eternal banishment to the eunuchs and all those who do not beget virtue, and that while in their stead He plants in the garden of our souls the trees of right instruction, He may grant us fruits of genuine worth and true virility, and powers of reason, capable of begetting good actions and also of bringing the virtues to their fullness, gifted too with the strength to bind together and keep safe for ever all that is akin to real happiness.
