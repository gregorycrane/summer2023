<head>On the Unchangeableness of God</head>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="1"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="1"/> “And after that,” says Moses, “when the angels

of God went in unto the daughters of men and begat for themselves”
<note n="3.11.a">E.V. “and they bare children to them.”</note>
  (Gen. vi. 4). It is worth our while to consider what is meant by the word “after that.” The answer is that it is a reference back, bringing out more clearly something of what has been already stated.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="2"><p> That something is his words about the divine

spirit, that nothing is harder than that it should abide for ever in the soul with its manifold forms and divisions—the soul which has fastened on it the grievous burden of this fleshly coil.
<note n="3.11.b">or “horde.” ὄχλος carries with it the idea both of a mob and the trouble and confusion caused by it. The flesh (plural) is here and elsewhere conceived of as manifold.</note>
  It is after that spirit
<note n="3.11.c">i.e. after the spirit has gone.</note>
  that the angels or messengers go in to the daughters of men.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="3"><p> For while the soul is illumined

by the bright and pure rays of wisdom, through which the sage sees God and His potencies, none of the messengers of falsehood has access to the reason, but all are barred from passing the bounds which the lustral water has consecrated.
<note n="3.11.d">See App. p. 483.</note>
  But when the light of the understanding is dimmed and clouded, they who are of the fellowship of darkness win the day, and mating with the nerveless and emasculated passions, which he has called the daughters of men,




<pb n="13"/>

beget offspring for themselves and not for God.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="4"><p> For the offspring of God’s parentage are the perfect

virtues, but the family of evil are the vices, whose note is discord.  If thou wilt know, my mind, what it is to beget not for thyself, learn the lesson from the perfect Abraham. He brings to God the dearly loved, the only trueborn offspring of the soul, that clearest image of self-learned wisdom, named Isaac, and without a murmur renders, as in duty bound, this fitting thank-offering. But first he bound, as the law tells us, the feet of the new strange victim (Gen. xxii. 9), either because having once received God’s inspiration he judged it right to tread no more on aught that was mortal, or it may be that he was taught to see how changeable and inconstant was creation, through his knowledge of the unwavering stedfastness that belongs to the Existent; for in this we are told he had put his trust (Gen. xv. 6).

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="5"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="2"/> He finds a disciple and

successor in Hannah, the gift of the wisdom of God, for the name Hannah interpreted is “her grace.” She received the divine seed and became pregnant. And when she had reached the consummation of her travail, and had brought forth the type of character which has its appointed place in God’s order, which she named Samuel, a name which being interpreted means “appointed to God,” she took him and rendered him in due payment to the Giver, judging that no good thing was her own peculiar property, nothing, which was not a grace and bounty from God.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="6"><p> For she speaks in the first book of Kings in this wise,

“I give to Thee him, a gift
<note n="3.13.a">See App. p. 483.</note>
 ” (1 Sam. i. 28), that is “who is a gift,” and so “I give him who has been given.”  This agrees with the most sacred

<pb n="15"/>

ordinance of Moses, “My gifts, My offerings, My fruits ye shall observe to bring to Me” (Num. xxviii.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="7"><p> 2). For to whom should we make thank-offering save to

God? and wherewithal save by what He has given us? for there is nothing else whereof we can have sufficiency. God needs nothing, yet in the exceeding greatness of His beneficence to our race He bids us bring what is His own. For if we cultivate the spirit of rendering thanks and honour to Him, we shall be pure from wrongdoing and wash away the filthiness which defiles our lives in thought and word and deed.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="8"><p> For it is absurd that a man should be forbidden to

enter the temples save after bathing and cleansing his body, and yet should attempt to pray and sacrifice with a heart still soiled and spotted. The temples are made of stones and timber, that is of soulless matter, and soulless too is the body in itself. And can it be that while it is forbidden to this soulless body to touch the soulless stones, except it have first been subjected to lustral and purificatory consecration, a man will not shrink from approaching with his soul impure the absolute purity of God and that too when there is no thought of repentance in his heart?</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="9"><p> He who is resolved not only to commit

no further sin, but also to wash away the past, may approach with gladness: let him who lacks this resolve keep far away, since hardly shall he be purified. For he shall never escape the eye of Him who sees into the recesses of the mind and treads its inmost shrine.

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="10"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="3"/> Indeed of the nature of the soul

beloved of God no clearer evidence can we have than that psalm of Hannah which contains the words “the barren hath borne seven, but she that had many children hath languished” (1 Sam. ii.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="11"><p> 5). And yet it



<pb n="17"/>

is the mother of one child—Samuel—who is speaking. How then can she say that she has borne seven? It can only be that in full accordance with the truth of things, she holds the One to be the same as the Seven,
<note n="3.17.a"><hi rend="italic">Cf. De Post.</hi> 64.</note>
  not only in the lore of numbers, but also in the harmony of the universe and in the thoughts of the virtuous soul. For Samuel who is appointed to God alone and holds no company with any other has his being ordered in accordance with the One and the Monad, the truly existent.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="12"><p> But this condition

of his implies the Seven, that is a soul which rests
<note n="3.17.b">Or “since his soul rests.”</note>
  in God and toils no more at any mortal task, and has thus left behind the Six, which God has assigned to those who could not win the first place, but must needs limit their claims to the second.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="13"><p>
<note n="3.17.c">For Philo’s ideas about Six and Seven <hi rend="italic">cf. Leg. All.</hi> i. 2–16.</note>
  We might well

expect, then, that the barren woman, not meaning the childless, but the “firm” or solid
<note n="3.17.d">In identifying στεῖραν, “barren,” with στερράν, “firm,” Philo is not so far out as in most of his philological vagaries. The two words may be the same in origin, “hard ground” being “barren ground.”</note>
  who still abounds in power, who with endurance and courage perseveres to the finish in the contest, where the prize is the acquisition of the Best, should bring forth the Monad which is of equal value with the Seven; for her nature is that of a happy and goodly motherhood.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="14"><p> And when she says that she who had many children

languishes, her words are as clear as they are true. For when the soul that is one departs from the one and is in travail with many, she naturally is multiplied a thousand-fold,
<note n="3.17.e">Or “vast is the number of children born to her.” See App. p. 483.</note>
  and then weighed down and sore pressed by the multitude of children that cling to her—most of them abortions born out of due time—she languishes utterly.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="15"><p> She brings forth the desires

of which the eyes and the ears are the channels, these for shapes and colours, those for sounds; she



<pb n="19"/>

is pregnant with the lusts of the belly and those which have their seat below it, and thus, under the crushing load of the many children that hang upon her, she grows faint and dropping her hands in weakness sinks in prostration.
<note n="3.19.a">Or “gives up the fight.”</note>
  This manner of defeat is the lot of all who engender things corruptible for their corruptible selves.

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="16"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="4"/> Some
<note n="3.19.b">The sections 16–19 largely repeat <hi rend="italic">De Post.</hi> 180, 181.</note>
  there are who through self-love have

brought upon themselves not only defeat but death. Thus Onan “perceiving that the seed will not be his” (Gen. xxxviii. 9), ceased not to destroy the reasoning principle, which in kind is the best of all existing things, till he himself underwent utter destruction. And right just and fitting was his fate.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="17"><p> For if there

shall be any whose every deed is self-seeking, who have no regard for the honouring of their parents, for the ordering of their children aright, for the safety of their country, for the maintenance of the laws, for the security of good customs, for the better conduct of things private and public, for the sanctity of temples, for piety towards God, miserable shall be their fate.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="18"><p> To sacrifice life itself for any single one

of these that I have named is honour and glory. But these self-lovers—they say that if these blessings, desirable as they are, were all put together, they would utterly despise them, if they should not procure them some future pleasure.
<note n="3.19.c">See App. p. 483.</note>
  And therefore God in His impartial justice will cast out to destruction that evil suggestion of an unnatural creed, called Onan.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="19"><p>  We must indeed reject all those


who “beget for themselves,” that is all those who pursue only their own profit and think not of others. For they think themselves born for themselves only and not for the innumerable others, for father, for

<pb n="21"/>

mother, for wife, for children, for country, for the human race, and if we must extend the list, for heaven, for earth, for the universe, for knowledge, for virtues, for the Father and Captain of all; to each of whom we are bound according to our powers to render what is due, not holding all things to be an adjunct of ourselves, but rather ourselves an adjunct of all.

<milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="5"/> Enough on this point.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="20"><p> Let us extend our discussion

to embrace the words that follow. “The Lord God,” says Moses, “seeing that the wickednesses of men were multiplied upon the earth and that every man intended evil in his heart diligently all his days, God had it in His mind that He had made man upon the earth, and He bethought Him. And God said, I will blot out man, whom I made, from the face of the earth” (Gen. vi.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="21"><p> 5–7).  Perhaps some


of those who are careless inquirers
<note n="3.21.a">Lit. “unexamined,” i.e. by themselves.</note>
  will suppose that the Lawgiver is hinting that the Creator repented of the creation of men when He beheld their impiety, and that this was the reason why He wished to destroy the whole race. Those who think thus may be sure that they make the sins of these men of old time seem light and trivial through the vastness of their own godlessness.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="22"><p> For what greater impiety

could there be than to suppose that the Unchangeable changes? Indeed some maintain
<note n="3.21.b">See App. p. 483.</note>
  that even among men vacillation of mind and judgement is not universal; for those who study philosophy in guilelessness
and purity, it is held, gain from their knowledge this as their chief reward, that they do not change with changing circumstances, but with unbending stedfastness and firm constancy take in hand all that it behoves them to do.

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="23"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="6"/> It is a tenet


of the lawgiver also that the perfect man seeks for

<pb n="23"/>

quietude. For the words addressed to the Sage with God as the speaker, “stand thou here with Me” (Deut. v. 31), shew most plainly how unbending, unwavering and broad-based is his will.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="24"><p> Wonderful

indeed is the soul of the Sage, how he sets it, like a lyre,
<note n="3.23.a">See App. p. 483.</note>
  to harmony not with a scale of notes low and high, but with the knowledge of moral opposites, and the practice of such of them as are better; how he does not strain it to excessive heights, nor yet relax it and weaken the concord of virtues and things naturally beautiful, but keeps it ever at an equal tension and plays it with hand or bow in melody.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="25"><p> Such a soul is the most perfect instrument fashioned

by nature, the pattern of those which are the work of our hands. And if it be well adjusted, it will produce a symphony the most beautiful in the world, one which has its consummation not in the cadences and tones of melodious sound, but in the consistencies of our life’s actions. Oh!</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="26"><p> if the soul of man, when

it feels the soft breeze of wisdom and knowledge, can dismiss the stormy surge which the fierce burst of the gale of wickedness has suddenly stirred, and levelling the billowy swell can rest in unruffled calm under a bright clear sky, can you doubt that He, the Imperishable Blessed One, who has taken as His own the sovereignty of the virtues, of perfection itself and beatitude, knows no change of will, but ever holds fast to what He purposed from the first without any alteration?</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="27"><p>  With men then


it must needs be that they are ready to change, through instability whether it be in themselves or outside them. So for example
<note n="3.23.b">See App. p. 484.</note>
  often when we have chosen our friends and been familiar with them for




<pb n="25"/>

a short time, we turn from them, though we have no charge to bring against them, and count them amongst our enemies, or at best as strangers.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="28"><p> Such

action proves the facile levity of ourselves, how little capacity we have for stoutly holding to our original judgements. But God has no such fickleness. Or again, sometimes we are minded to hold to the standards we have taken but we find ourselves with others who have not remained constant, and thus our judgements perforce change with theirs.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="29"><p> For a

mere man cannot foresee the course of future events, or the judgements of others, but to God as in pure sunlight all things are manifest. For already He has pierced into the recesses of our soul, and what is invisible to others is clear as daylight to His eyes. He employs the forethought and foreknowledge which are virtues peculiarly His own, and suffers nothing to escape His control or pass outside His comprehension. For not even about the future can uncertainty be found with Him, since nothing is uncertain or future to God.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="30"><p> No one doubts that the

parent must have knowledge of his offspring, the craftsman of his handiwork, the steward of things entrusted to his stewardship. But God is in very truth the father and craftsman and steward of the heaven and the universe and all that is therein. Future events lie shrouded in the darkness of the time that is yet to be at different distances, some near, some far.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="31"><p>  But God is the maker of


time
<note n="3.25.a">See App. p. 484.</note>
  also, for He is the father of time’s father, that is of the universe, and has caused the movements of the one to be the source of the generation of the other. Thus time stands to God in the relation of a grandson. For this universe, since we perceive it by our senses,

<pb n="27"/>

is the younger son of God. To the elder son, I mean the intelligible universe, He assigned the place of firstborn, and purposed that it should remain in His own keeping.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="32"><p> So this younger son, the world of our

senses, when set in motion, brought that entity we call time to the brightness of its rising. And thus with God there is no future, since He has made the boundaries of the ages subject to Himself. For God’s life is not a time, but eternity, which is the archetype and pattern of time
<note n="3.27.a">See App. p. 484.</note>
 ; and in eternity there is no past nor future, but only present existence.

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="33"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="7"/> Having now discoursed sufficiently on the

theme that the Existent does not experience repentance, we will explain in due sequence the words “God had it in His mind that He had made men upon the earth and He bethought Him” (Gen. vi.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="34"><p> 6). “Having

in one’s mind” and “bethinking,” the former being the thought quiescent in the mind,
<note n="3.27.a">See App. p. 484.</note>
  the latter the thought brought to an issue, are two most constant powers, which the Maker of all things has taken as His own and ever employs them when He contemplates His own works. Those of His creatures who do not leave their appointed places, He praises for their obedience. Those who depart from it He visits with the punishment which is the doom of deserters.
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="35"><p><milestone unit="para"/>This is explained by consideration of the

different conditions, which He has made inseparable from the various bodies.
<note n="3.27.b">The fourfold classification which follows has been already given shortly in <hi rend="italic">Leg. All.</hi> ii. 22–23.</note>
  These are in some cases cohesion, in others growth, in others life, in others a reasoning soul. Thus, in stones and bits of wood which have been severed from their organism, He wrought cohesion, which acts as the most rigid of bonds. Cohesion
<note n="3.27.c">See note in App. on <hi rend="italic">Leg. All.</hi> ii. 22.</note>
  is a breath or current ever returning



<pb n="29"/>

to itself. It begins to extend itself from the centre of the body in question to its extremes, and when it has reached the outermost surface it reverses its course, till it arrives at the place from which it first set out.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="36"><p> This regular double course of cohesion

is indestructible; and it is this which the runners imitate at the triennial festivals in the places of spectacle universal among men, and exhibit as a great and splendid feat, well worthy of their efforts.

<milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="8"/> Growth God assigned to plants.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="37"><p> It is a compound

of many capacities, that of taking nourishment, that of undergoing change and that of increasing. Nourishment plants receive as they need it, as the following proof shews. When they are not watered they decay and wither, just as their increase when watered is plain to see, for sprouts heretofore too tiny to rise above the ground suddenly shoot up and become quite tall. It is hardly necessary to speak of their function of change.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="38"><p> When the winter solstice arrives,

the leaves wither and shed themselves to the ground, and the “eyes,” as the husbandmen call them, on the twigs close like eyes in animals, and all the outlets which serve to put forth life are bound tight, for Nature
<note n="3.29.a">Or “power of growth.”</note>
  within them compresses herself and hibernates, to get a breathing-space, like an athlete after his first contest, and thus having regained her fund of strength, comes forth to resume the familiar conflict. And this comes to pass in the spring and summer seasons.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="39"><p> For she arises as though from a

deep sleep and unseals the eyes, opens wide the closed outlets, and brings forth all that is in her womb, shoots, twigs, tendrils, leaves and, to crown all, fruit. Then when the fruit is fully formed, she



<pb n="31"/>

provides nourishment, like the mother to the infant, through some hidden channels, which correspond to the breasts in women, and she ceases not to minister this nourishment till the fruit is brought to its consummation.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="40"><p> That consummation comes to the fully

ripened fruit, when, if none pluck it, it automatically seeks to disengage itself from its organism, since it needs no longer the nurture which its parent supplies, and is capable, if it chance to drop on good soil, of sowing and producing other plants similar to those which gave it its existence.

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="41"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="9"/> Life was made by its creator different from

growth in three ways. It has sensation, “presentation,
<note n="3.31.a">“The word φαντασία, ‘appearance’ or ‘appearing,’ is a technical term in Stoic logic for which no one English equivalent is as yet unanimously adopted. It denotes the immediate datum of consciousness or experience, whether presented to the sense or in certain cases to the mind. Hence ‘presentation’ is nearer than ‘perception’ or ‘impression’ (Hicks on Diog. Laert. vii. 43; Loeb translation, vol. ii. p. 152).</note>
 ” impulse. For plants have no impulse, no
“presentation,” no gift of sense-perception, while each living creature participates in all three combined.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="42"><p> Sensation or sense, as the name itself shews,

is “a putting in,” and introduces what has appeared to it to the mind. For mind is a vast and receptive storehouse in which all that comes through sight or hearing and the other organs of sense is placed and treasured.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="43"><p> | “Presentation” is an imprint


made on the soul. For, like a ring or seal, it stamps
<note n="3.31.b">See App. p. 484.</note>
  on the soul the image corresponding to everything which each of the senses has introduced. And the mind like wax receives the impress and retains it vividly, until forgetfulness the opponent of memory levels out the imprint, and makes it indistinct, or entirely effaces it.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="44"><p> But the object which has presented

itself and made the impression has an effect upon the soul sometimes of an appropriate kind,
<note n="3.31.b">See App. p. 484.</note>
  sometimes the reverse. And this condition or state




<pb n="33"/>

of the soul is called impulse or appetite, which has been defined as the first movement of the soul.
<note n="3.33.a">See App. p. 484.</note>

<milestone unit="para"/>In all these ways living creatures excel plants.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="45"><p>

Let us now see where man has been made superior to other animals.

<milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="10"/> We find that the special prerogative he has received is mind, habituated to apprehend the natures both of all material objects and of things in general. For as sight holds the leading place in the body, and the quality of light holds the leading place in the universe, so too in us the dominant element is the mind.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="46"><p> For mind is the sight of the

soul,
<note n="3.33.a">See App. p. 484.</note>
  illuminated by rays peculiar to itself, whereby the vast and profound darkness, poured upon it by ignorance of things, is dispersed. This branch of the soul was not formed of the same elements, out of which the other branches were brought to completion, but it was allotted something better and purer,
<note n="3.33.b">See App. p. 485.</note>
  the substance in fact out of which
<note n="3.33.c">i.e. the stars, <hi rend="italic">cf. De Gig.</hi> 7. See App. Vol. II. p. 502.</note>
  divine natures were wrought. And therefore it is reasonably held that the mind alone in all that makes us what we are is indestructible.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="47"><p> For it is mind alone which the

Father who begat it judged worthy of freedom, and loosening the fetters of necessity, suffered it to range as it listed, and of that free-will which is His most peculiar possession and most worthy of His majesty gave it such portion as it was capable of receiving. For the other living creatures in whose souls the mind, the element set apart for liberty, has no place, have been committed under yoke and bridle to the service of men, as slaves to a master. But man, possessed of a spontaneous and self-determined will, whose activities for the most part rest on deliberate choice, is with reason blamed for what he does wrong with intent, praised when he acts rightly of

<pb n="35"/>

his own will.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="48"><p> In the others, the plants and animals,

no praise is due if they bear well, nor blame if they fare ill: for their movements and changes in either direction come to them from no deliberate choice or volition of their own. But the soul of man alone has received from God the faculty of voluntary movement, and in this way especially is made like to Him, and thus being liberated, as far as might be, from that hard and ruthless mistress, necessity, may justly be charged with guilt, in that it does not honour its Liberator. And therefore it will rightly pay the inexorable penalty which is meted to ungrateful
freedmen.
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="49"><p><milestone unit="para"/>Thus God “had it in His mind and bethought

Him” not now for the first time, but ever from of old—a thought that was fixed and stedfast—“that He had made man,” that is He thought of what nature He had made him. He had made him free and unfettered, to employ his powers of action with voluntary and deliberate choice for this purpose, that, knowing good and ill and receiving the conception of the noble and the base, and setting himself in sincerity to apprehend just and unjust and in general what belongs to virtue and what to vice, he might practise to choose the better and eschew the opposite.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="50"><p> | And therefore we have an


oracle of this kind recorded in Deuteronomy. “Behold, I have set before thy face life and death, good and evil; choose life” (Deut. xxx. 15, 19). So then in this way He puts before us both truths; first that men have been made with a knowledge both of good and evil, its opposite; secondly, that it is their duty to choose the better rather than the worse, because they have, as it were, within them an incorruptible

<pb n="37"/>

judge in the reasoning faculty, which will accept all that right reason suggests and reject the promptings of its opposite.

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="51"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="11"/> Having made this point sufficiently clear let

us consider the next words, which are as follows, “I will blot out man whom I made from the face of the earth, from man to beast, from creeping things to fowls of heaven, because I was wroth in that I made him” (Gen. vi.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="52"><p> 7). Again, some on hearing these

words suppose that the Existent feels wrath and anger, whereas He is not susceptible to any passion at all. For disquiet is peculiar to human weakness, but neither the unreasoning passions of the soul, nor the parts and members of the body in general, have any relation to God. | All the same the Lawgiver uses such expressions, just so far as they serve for a kind of elementary lesson, to admonish those who could not otherwise be brought to their senses.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="53"><p> Thus, in the laws which deal with commands and

prohibitions (laws, that is, in the proper sense of the word),
<note n="3.37.a">See App. p. 485.</note>
  there stand forth above others two leading statements
<note n="3.37.a">See App. p. 485.</note>
  about the Cause, one that “God is not as a man” (Num. xxiii. 19); the other that He is as a man.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="54"><p> But while the former is warranted by grounds

of surest truth, the latter is introduced for the instruction of the many. And therefore also it is said of Him “like a man He shall train His son” (Deut. viii. 5). And thus it is for training and admonition, not because God’s nature is such, that these words are used.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="55"><p> Among men some are soul lovers, some

body lovers. The comrades of the soul, who can hold converse with intelligible incorporeal natures, do not compare the Existent to any form of created things. They have dissociated Him from every category

<pb n="39"/>

or quality, for it is one of the facts which go to make His blessedness and supreme felicity that His being is apprehended as simple being, without other definite characteristic; and thus they do not picture it with form, but admit to their minds the conception of existence only.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="56"><p> But those who have

made a compact and a truce with the body are unable to cast off from them the garment of flesh, and to descry existence needing nothing in its unique solitariness, and free from all admixture and composition in its absolute simplicity. And therefore they think of the Cause of all in the same terms as of themselves, and do not reflect that while a being which is formed through the union of several faculties needs several parts to minister to the need of each,

<milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="12"/> God being uncreated and the Author of the creation of the others needs none of the properties which belong to the creatures which He has brought into being.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="57"><p>  For consider, if He uses our


bodily parts or organs He has feet to move from one place to another. But whither will He go or walk since His presence fills everything? To whom will He go, when none is His equal? And for what purpose will He walk? For it cannot be out of care for health as it is with us.
<note n="3.39.a">See App. p. 485</note>
  Hands He must have to receive and give. Yet He receives nothing from anyone, for, besides that He has no needs, all things are His possessions, and when He gives, He employs as minister of His gifts the Reason wherewith also He made the world.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="58"><p> Nor did He need eyes, which

have no power of perception without the light which meets our sense. But that light is created, whereas God saw before creation, being Himself His own light. Why need we speak of the organs of nourishment?</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="59"><p>



<pb n="41"/>

If He has them, He eats and is filled, rests awhile and after the rest has need again, and the accompaniments of this I will not dwell upon. These are the mythical fictions of the impious, who, professing to represent the deity as of human form, in reality represent Him as having human passions.

<milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="13"/> Why then does Moses speak of feet and hands.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="60"><p>

goings in and goings out in connexion with the Uncreated, or of His arming to defend Himself against His enemies? For he describes Him as bearing a sword, and using as His weapons winds and death-dealing
fire (thunderbolt and storm blast the poets call them, using different words, and say they are the weapons of the Cause). Why again does he speak of His jealousy, His wrath, His moods of anger, and the other emotions similar to them, which he describes in terms of human nature?</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="61"><p> But to those who ask these questions Moses answers thus: “Sirs,

the lawgiver who aims at the best must have one end only before him—to benefit all whom his work reaches. Those to whose lot has fallen a generously gifted nature and a training blameless throughout, and who thus find that their later course through life lies in a straight and even highway, have truth for their fellow-traveller, and being admitted by her into the infallible mysteries of the Existent do not overlay the conception of God with any of the attributes of created being.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="62"><p> These find

a moral most pertinent in the oracles of revelation, that “God is not as a man” nor yet is He as the heaven or the universe.
<note n="3.41.a">See App. p. 485.</note>
  These last are forms of a particular kind which present themselves to our senses. But He is not apprehensible even by the mind, save in the fact that He is. For it is His

<pb n="43"/>

existence which we apprehend, and of what lies outside that existence nothing.

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="63"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="14"/> But

they whose natural wit is more dense and dull, or whose early training has been mishandled, since they have no power of clear vision, need physicians in the shape of admonishers, who will devise the treatment proper to their present condition.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="64"><p> Thus ill-disciplined

and foolish slaves receive profit from a master who frightens them, for they fear his threats and menaces and thus involuntarily are schooled by fear. All such may well learn the untruth, which will benefit them, if they cannot be brought to wisdom by truth.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="65"><p>  Thus too in dealing with dangerous

sicknesses of the body,
<note n="3.43.a">See App. p. 485.</note>
  the most approved physicians do not allow themselves to tell the truth to their patients, since they know that this will but increase their disheartenment, and bring no recovery from the malady, whereas under the encouragement, which the opposite course of treatment gives, they will bear more contentedly their present trouble, and at the same time the disease will be relieved.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="66"><p>  For what sensible physician would say to his patient,


“Sir, you will be subjected to the knife, the cautery or amputation” even if it will be necessary that he should submit to such operations. No one. For the patient will lose heart beforehand, and add to the existing malady of the body a still more painful malady of the soul and break down when faced with the treatment. Whereas if through the physician’s deceit he expects the opposite, he will gladly endure
<note n="3.43.b">See App. p. 486.</note>
  everything with patience, however painful the methods of saving him may be.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="67"><p> So then the lawgiver,



<pb n="45"/>

thereby being now approved as the best of physicians for the distempers and maladies of the soul, set before himself one task and purpose, to make a radical excision of the diseases of the mind and leave no root to sprout again into sickness which defies cure.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="68"><p> In this way he hoped to be able to eradicate the

evil, namely by representing the supreme Cause as dealing in threats and oftentimes shewing indignation and implacable anger, or again as using weapons of war for His onslaughts on the unrighteous. For this is the only way in which the fool can be admonished. And therefore it seems to me that with the two aforesaid maxims, “God is as a man,” and “God is not as a man,” he has linked two other principles closely connected and consequent on them, namely fear and love. For I observe that all the exhortations to piety in the law refer either to our loving or our fearing the Existent. And thus to love Him is the most suitable for those into whose conception of the Existent no thought of human parts or passions enters, who pay Him the honour meet for God for His own sake only. To fear is most suitable to the others.

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="70"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="15"/> Such are the points which needed to be

established as preliminaries to our inquiry. We must return to the original question which caused us difficulty, namely, what thought is suggested by the words “I was wroth in that I made them.”
<note n="3.45.a">See App. p. 486.</note>
  Perhaps then he wishes to shew us that the bad have become what they are through the wrath of God and the good through His grace. For the next words are
“but Noah found grace with Him” (Gen. vi.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="71"><p> 8). Now the passion of wrath, which is properly speaking

an attribute of men, is here used in a more metaphorical

<pb n="47"/>

sense, yet still correctly, of the Existent, to bring out a vital truth, that all our actions by general consent are worthy of blame and censure, if done through fear or anger, or grief or pleasure, or any other passion, but worthy of praise if done with rectitude of reason and knowledge.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="72"><p> Mark what

caution he shows in his form of statement. He says
“I was wroth in that I made them,”
<note n="3.47.a">Or “(I will destroy him) because I was wroth in that I made him,” i.e. the first ὅτι may (1) introduce the quotation, or (2) be part of the quotation.</note>
  not in the reverse order, “because I made them, I was wroth.”
The latter would show change of mind or repentance, a thing impossible to the all-foreseeing nature of God. In the former he brings before us a doctrine of great importance that wrath is the source of misdeeds, but the reasoning faculty of right actions.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="73"><p> But God,

remembering His perfect and universal goodness, even though the whole vast body of mankind should through its exceeding sinfulness accomplish its own ruin, stretches forth the right hand of salvation, takes them under His protection and raises them up, and suffers not the race to be brought to utter destruction and annihilation.

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="74"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="16"/> And therefore

it now says that when the others who had proved ungrateful were doomed to pay the penalty, Noah found grace with Him, that so He might mingle His saving mercy with the judgement pronounced on sinners. And so the Psalmist said somewhere (Ps. c. [ci.] 1), “I will sing to thee of mercy and judgement.”</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="75"><p> For if God should will to judge the

race of mortals without mercy, His sentence will be one of condemnation, since there is no man who self-sustained has run the course of life from birth to death without stumbling, but in every case his footsteps

steps have slipped through errors, some voluntary, some involuntary.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="76"><p> So then that the race may subsist,

though many of those which go to form it are swallowed up by the deep, He tempers His judgement with the mercy which He shews in doing kindness even to the unworthy. And not only does this mercy follow His judgement but it also precedes it. For mercy with Him is older than justice, since He knows who is worthy of punishment, not only after judgement is given, but before it.

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="77"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="17"/> And


therefore it is said in another place, “there is a cup in the hand of the Lord of unmixed wine, full of mixture” (Ps. lxxiv. [lxxv.] 8). But surely the mixed is not unmixed, and yet there is a meaning in these words most true to nature, and in agreement with what I have said before. For the powers which God employs are unmixed in respect of Himself, but mixed to created beings. For it cannot be that mortal nature should have room for the unmixed.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="78"><p> We cannot look even upon the sun’s flame un-tempered,

or unmixed, for our sight will be quenched and blasted by the bright flashing of its rays, ere it reach and apprehend them, though the sun is but one of God’s works in the past, a portion of heaven, a condensed mass of ether.
<note n="3.49.a">See App. p. 486.</note>
  And can you think it possible that your understanding should be able to grasp in their unmixed purity those uncreated potencies, which stand around Him and flash forth light of surpassing splendour?</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="79"><p> When God extended the

sun’s rays from heaven to the boundaries of earth, He mitigated and abated with cool air the fierceness of their heat. He tempered them in this way, that the radiance drawn off from the blazing flame, surrendering its power of burning but retaining that

<pb n="51"/>

of giving light, might meet and hail its friend and kinsman,
<note n="3.51.a">See App. p. 486.</note>
  the light which is stored in the treasury of our eyes; for it is when these converge to meet and greet each other that the apprehension through vision is produced. Just in the same way if God’s knowledge and wisdom and prudence and justice and each of His other excellences were not tempered, no mortal could receive them, nay not even the whole heaven and universe.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="80"><p> The Creator then,

knowing His own surpassing excellence in all that is best and the natural weakness of His creatures, however loud they boast, wills not to dispense benefit or punishment according to His power, but according to the measure of capacity which He sees in those who are to participate in either of those dispensations.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="81"><p> If indeed we could drink and enjoy this diluted

draught, wherein is a moderate measure of His powers, we should reap sufficient gladness, and let not the human race seek a more perfect joy. For we have shewn that these powers at their full height unmixed and untempered subsist only in the Existent.

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="82"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="18"/> We have something similar to

the above-mentioned words in another passage, “The Lord spake once, I have heard these two things”
<note n="3.51.b">E.V. “God hath spoken once, twice have I heard this,”</note>
  (Ps. lxi. [lxii.] 11). For “once” is like the unmixed, for the unmixed is a monad and the monad is unmixed, whereas twice is like the mixed, for the mixed is not single, since it admits both combination and separation.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="83"><p> God then speaks in unmixed

monads or unities. For His word is not a sonant impact of voice upon air, or mixed with anything else at all, but it is unbodied and unclothed and in

no way different from unity. But our hearing is the product of two factors, of a dyad.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="84"><p> For the breath

from the seat of the master-principle driven up through the windpipe is shaped in the mouth by the workmanship, as it were, of the tongue, and rushing out it mixes with its congener the air, and impinging on it produces in a harmonious union the mixture which constitutes the dyad.
<note n="3.53.a">See App. p. 487.</note>
  For the consonance
<note n="3.53.a">See App. p. 487.</note>
  caused by different sounds is harmonized in a dyad originally divided which contains a high and a low pitch.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="85"><p>  Right well then did the lawgiver


act when he opposed to the multitude of unjust thoughts the just man as one—numerically less, but greater in value. His purpose is that the worse should not prove the weightier when tested as in the scales, but by the victorious force of the opposite tendency to the better cause should kick the beam and prove powerless.

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="86"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="19"/> Now let us consider what is meant by “Noah

found grace before the Lord God” (Gen. vi. 8). Finders sometimes find again what they possessed and have lost, sometimes what they did not own in the past and now gain for the first time. People who seek exactitude in the use of words are wont to call the process in the second case “finding” or
“discovery” and in the first “refinding” or “recovery.”</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="87"><p>  We have a very clear example

of the former in the commandment of the Great Vow (Num. vi. 2). Now a vow is a request for good things from God, while a “great vow” is to hold that God Himself and by Himself is the cause of good things, that though the earth may seem to be the mother of fruits, rain to give increase to seeds and plants, air to have the power of fostering them,

<pb n="55"/>

husbandry to be the cause of the harvest, medicine the cause of health, marriage of childbirth, yet nothing else is His fellow-worker that we may think of them as bringing us benefit.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="88"><p>
<note n="3.55.a">The translation follows Mangey in omitting τῶν before εἰς τὸ δοκεῖν ὠφελεῖν. This, however, is not quite satisfactory, as εἰς τὸ δοκεῖν would naturally mean “as regards semblance.” Perhaps retain τῶν and for ὠφελεῖν substitute ὠφελίμων.</note>
  For all these things,

through the power of God, admit of change and transition, so as often to produce effects quite the reverse of the ordinary. He who makes this vow then, says Moses, must be “holy, suffering the hair of his head to grow
<note n="3.55.b">Literally “fostering the head’s hair as long locks.” In the allegory the “head’s hair” becomes the “growths of truths,” which are of the nature of heads or leading principles, and since κομᾶν, “to wear long hair,” also means “to be proud,” κόμη is interpreted as the pride which we should feel in virtue. For further elucidation see App. p. 487.</note>
 ” (Num. vi. 5). This means that he must foster the young growths of virtue’s truths in the mind which rules his being; these growths must be to him as it were heads, and he must take pride in them as in the glory of the hair.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="89"><p> But sometimes he

loses these early growths, when as it were a whirlwind swoops suddenly down upon the soul and tears from it all that was beautiful in it. This whirlwind is a kind of involuntary defection straightway defiling the soul, and this he calls death (Num. vi.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="90"><p> 9). He

has lost, yet in time, when purified, he makes good the loss, remembers what he had forgotten for a while, and finds what he has lost, so that the “former days,” the days of defection, are regarded as not to be counted
<note n="3.55.c">In the original no doubt this means that as contact with the corpse cancels the vow, the days before the defilement must not be reckoned as part of the necessary period, and indeed Philo’s Greek might be translated as “the days before the defection”; but the argument requires that the words should be taken as in the translation.</note>
  (Num. vi. 12), either because defection is a thing beyond all calculation, discordant with right reason and having no partnership with prudence, or because they are not worthy to be counted. For of such as these there is, as has been said,
<note n="3.55.d">A proverbial expression. <hi rend="italic">Cf.</hi> Theocritus, <hi rend="italic">Id.</hi> xiv. 48 ἄμμες δ᾿ οὔτε λόγω τινος ἄξιοι οὔτ᾿ ἀριθματοί.</note>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="91"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="20"/> On the other hand, it



<pb n="57"/>

is a common experience that things befall us of which we have not even dreamt, like the story of the husbandman who, digging his orchard to plant some fruit-trees, lighted on a treasure, and thus met with prosperity beyond his hopes.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="92"><p> Thus the Practiser,

<note n="3.57.a">Or “the father of his knowledge.” See App. p. 487.</note>
  “What is this that thou hast found so quickly, my son?” answered and said,
“It is what the Lord God delivered before me”
(Gen. xxvii. 20). For when God delivers to us the lore of His eternal wisdom without our toil or labour we find in it suddenly and unexpectedly a treasure of perfect happiness.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="93"><p> It often happens that those

who seek with toil fail to find the object of their search, while others without thought and with the utmost ease find what had never crossed their minds. The slow-souled dullards, like men who have lost their eyesight, labour fruitlessly in the study of any branch of knowledge, while to others richly blessed by nature it comes unsought in myriad forms; theirs is a ready and unfailing grasp; it seems as though they trouble not to come in contact with the objects of their study, rather that these are impelled to take the lead and hurry to present themselves before the student’s vision, and create in him the unerring apprehension which they have to give.

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="94"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="21"/> It is to these men that are given, in the lawgiver’s

words, “cities great and beautiful which they built not, houses full of good things which they did not fill, pits hewn out which they did not hew, vineyards and olive-gardens which they did not plant”
(Deut. vi.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="95"><p> 10, 11). Under the symbol of cities and

houses he speaks of the generic and specific virtues.



<pb n="59"/>

For the genus resembles the city, because its limits are marked out by wider circuits and it embraces a larger number. The species on the other hand resembles the house, because it is more concentrated and avoids the idea of community.</p></div>

  for the latter.  Happy
then are these, and their case is as the state of those who waken from deep sleep, and suddenly without toil or active effort open their eyes upon the world. Miserable are those

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="98"><p>

Not only do they fail to gain their end, but they incur great shame and no small damage to boot. They are like ships ploughing the seas in the face of contrary winds; for not only do they fail to reach the roadsteads to which they press, but often they capsize, vessel, crew and cargo, and are a source of grief to their friends and joy to their foes.</p></div>

  into the mountain, and the Amorite who dwelt in that mountain came out and wounded them, as bees might do, and chased them from Seir to Hormah” (Deut. i.</p></div>

if those, who have no aptness for the acquisition of

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="101"><p> Would you say

in the words “Noah found grace with the Lord God.” Is the meaning that he obtained grace or that he was thought worthy of grace? The former is not a reasonable supposition. For in that case what more was given to him than to practically all creatures, not only those who are compounded of body and soul, but also simple elementary natures, all accepted as recipients of divine grace?</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="105"><p>  The second explanation is founded on a not unreasonable

idea, that the Cause judges those worthy of His gifts, who do not deface with base practices the coin within them which bears the stamp of God, even the sacred mind. And yet perhaps that explanation is not the true one.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="106"><p> For how great must we suppose

him to be, who shall be judged worthy of grace with God? Hardly, I think, could the whole world attain to this, and yet the world is the first and the greatest and the most perfect of God’s works.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="107"><p>  Perhaps then it would be better to accept this explanation,

that the man of worth, being zealous in inquiring and eager to learn, in all his inquiries found this to be the highest truth, that all things are the grace or gift of God—earth, water, air, fire, sun, stars, heaven, all plants and animals. But God has bestowed no gift of grace on Himself, for He does not need it, but He has given the world to the world, and its parts to themselves and to each other, aye and to the All.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="108"><p> But He has given His good things

in abundance to the All and its parts, not because He judged anything worthy of grace, but looking to

<pb n="65"/>

His eternal goodness, and thinking that to be beneficent was incumbent on His blessed and happy nature. So that if anyone should ask me what was the motive for the creation of the world, I will answer what Moses has taught, that it was the goodness of the Existent, that goodness which is the oldest of His bounties and itself the source of others.

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="109"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="24"/> But we must observe that he says that Noah

was well pleasing to the Potencies of the Existent, to the Lord and to God (Gen. vi. 8), but Moses to Him who is attended by the Potencies, and without them is only conceived of as pure being. For it is said with God as speaker, “thou hast found grace with Me” (Exod. xxxiii. 17), in which words He shews Himself as Him who has none other with Him.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="110"><p> Thus, then, through His own agency alone does He

who IS judge the supreme wisdom shewn in Moses to be worthy of grace, but the wisdom which was but a copy of that, the wisdom which is secondary and of the nature of species, He judges as worthy through His subject Potencies, which present Him to us as Lord and God, Ruler and Benefactor.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="111"><p>  But there is a different mind
<note n="3.65.a">See App. p. 488.</note>
  which loves the body

and the passions and has been sold in slavery to that chief cateress (Gen. xxxix. 1) of our compound nature, Pleasure. Eunuch-like it has been deprived of all the male and productive organs of the soul, and lives in indigence of noble practices, unable to receive the divine message, debarred from the holy congregation (Deut. xxiii. 1) in which the talk and study is always of virtue. When this mind is cast





<pb n="67"/>

into the prison of the passions, it finds in the eyes of the chief jailer a favour and grace, which is more inglorious than dishonour.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="112"><p> For, in the true sense of

the word, prisoners are not those who after condemnation by magistrates chosen by lot, or it may be elected jurymen, are haled to the appointed place of malefactors, but those whose character of soul is condemned by nature, as full to the brim of folly and incontinence and cowardice, and injustice and impiety and other innumerable plagues.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="113"><p> Now the overseer

and warder and manager of them, the governor of the prison, is the concentration and congeries of all vices multitudinous and manifold, woven together into a single form, and to be pleasing to him is to suffer the greatest of penalties. But some do not see the nature of this penalty, but, being deluded into counting the harmful as beneficial, become right joyfully his courtiers and satellites, in the hope that having judged them to be faithful he may make them his subalterns and lieutenants to keep guard over the sins which are committed with the will or without it.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="114"><p> My soul, hold such a mastery and captaincy

<pb n="69"/>

make thee well pleasing to the rulers of the prison, but desire exceedingly and with all zeal what may make thee pleasing to the Cause. But if so be that this is beyond thy powers—so vast is the greatness of His dignity
<note n="3.69.a">Or (1) the honour which you seek; (2) such a purpose or ambition.</note>
 —set thy face and betake thee to His Potencies and make thyself their suppliant, till they accept the constancy and fidelity of thy service, and appoint thee to take thy place amongst those in whom they are well pleased, even as they appointed Noah; of whose descendants Moses has given a genealogy of a truly strange and novel sort.  For he says, “these are the generations of Noah.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="117"><p>

Noah was a just man, perfect in his generation, Noah was well pleasing to God” (Gen. vi. 9). The offspring indeed of creatures compounded of soul and body, must also themselves be compound; horses necessarily beget horses, lions beget lions, bulls beget bulls, and so too with men.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="118"><p> Not such are the offspring

proper to a good mind; but they are the virtues mentioned in the text, the fact that he was a man, that he was just, that he was perfect, that he was well pleasing to God. And this last as being the consummation of these virtues, and the definition of supreme happiness, is put at the end of them all.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="119"><p>  Now one form of generation is the process


by which things are drawn and journey so to speak from non-existence to existence, and this process is that which is always necessarily followed by plants and animals. But there is also another which consists in the change from the higher genus to the lower species, and this it is which Moses had in mind when he says, “But these are the generations of Jacob. Joseph was seventeen years old, keeping sheep with his brethren, being still young, with the

<pb n="71"/>

sons of Bilhah and with the sons of Zelpah, his father’s wives” (Gen. xxxvii.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="120"><p> 2).  For when this


reason, once so diligent of practice and filled with love of learning, is brought down from diviner concepts to human and mortal opinions, then at once Joseph is born, Joseph who follows in the train of the body and bodily things. He is still young, even though length of years may have made him grey-headed; for never have there come to his knowledge the thoughts or lessons of riper age, which those who are ranked as members of the company of Moses have learnt, and found in them a treasure and a joy most profitable to themselves and to those who hold converse with them.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="121"><p> It is for this reason, I think,

because he wished to portray Joseph’s image and the exact form of his character in a clearer way, that Moses represents him as keeping sheep, not with any true-born brother, but with the base-born, the sons of the concubines, who are designated by the lower parentage, which is traced to the women, and not by the higher, which is traced to the men. For they are in this instance called the sons of the women Bilhah and Zilpah but not the sons of their father Israel.

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="122"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="26"/> We may properly ask, why directly after

the recital of Noah’s perfection in virtues, we are told that “the earth was corrupt before the Lord and filled with iniquity” (Gen. vi. 11). And yet perhaps save for one who is especially uninstructed it is not difficult to obtain a solution.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="123"><p> We should

say then that when the incorruptible element takes its rise in the soul, the mortal is forthwith corrupted. For the birth of noble practices is the death of the base, for when the light shines, the darkness

<pb n="73"/>

disappears.  And therefore in the law of
leprosy it is most carefully laid down, that if a living colour
<note n="3.73.a">E.V. “raw flesh”; χρώς can mean either “flesh” or “colour.” The LXX no doubt meant the former. Philo, who in § 125 equates it with χρῶμα, took it as the latter.</note>
  arise in the leper, he shall be denied (Lev. xiii.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="124"><p> 14, 15). And by way of clinching this and so to

speak setting a seal upon it, he adds “and the healthy colour will defile him.” This is quite opposed to the natural and ordinary view. For all men hold that things healthy are corrupted by things diseased, and living things by dead things, but they do not hold the converse, that the healthy and living corrupt their opposites, but rather that they save and preserve them.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="125"><p> But the lawgiver, original as ever in his

wisdom, has here laid down something distinctly his own. He teaches us that it is the healthy and living which produce the condition which is tainted with pollution. For the healthy and living colour in the soul, when it makes a genuine appearance upon it, is Conviction.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="126"><p>
<note n="3.73.b">Variously translated as “Convictor,” “Testing Power,” “Challenger.” It is almost equinalent to “Conscience”; compare the description in <hi rend="italic">Quod Det.</hi> 23. Compare also the functions of the Paraclete in John xvi. 8, where the R.V. gives for ἐλέγχει “convict,” in the place of the “reprove” of the A.V.</note>
  When this Conviction comes to the

surface it makes a record of all the soul’s transgressions, and rebukes and reproaches and calls shame upon it almost without ceasing. And the soul thus convicted sees in their true light its practices each and all, which were contrary to right reason, and then perceives that it is foolish and intemperate and unjust and infected with pollution.

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="127"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="27"/> For the same reason Moses enacts a law,

which is indeed a paradox, whereby he declares that the leper who is partially a leper is unclean, but that when the leprosy has taken hold of him throughout, from the sole of his foot to the crown of his head, he is clean (Lev. xiii. 11–13). One would



<pb n="75"/>

probably have conjectured the opposite, as indeed it would be reasonable to suppose that leprosy, if limited and confined to a small part of the body, is less unclean, but if diffused, so as to embrace all the body, is more unclean.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="128"><p> But he is shewing, I think,

through these symbols (and a very true lesson it is), that such wrongdoings as are involuntary, however wide their extent, are pure and devoid of guilt, for they have no stern accuser in conscience, but voluntary sins, even though the space they cover be not large, are convicted by the judge within the soul and thus are proved to be unholy and foul and impure.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="129"><p> | Thus then the leprosy, which is

twy-natured and flowers into two colours, shews voluntary wickedness. For the soul has within it the healthy, lively upright reason, and yet it does not use it as its pilot
<note n="3.75.a">See App. p. 489.</note>
  to guide it to the safety which things noble give, but abandons itself to those who have no skill of seamanship, and thus swamps utterly the bark of life which might have reached its bourn safely in calm and fair weather.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="130"><p> But the leprosy

which changes into a single white appearance, represents involuntary error, when the mind is throughout reft of reasoning power, and not a germ is left of what might grow into understanding, and thus, as men in a mist and profound darkness, it sees nothing of what it should do, but, like a blind man tripping over every obstacle since he cannot see before him, it is subject to constant slips and repeated falls in which the will has no part.

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="131"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="28"/> Similar

again is the enactment about the house in which leprosy is a frequent occurrence. For the law says that “if there is an infection
<note n="3.75.b">Or “symptom.”</note>
  of leprosy in a house, the owner shall come and report it to the priest

<pb n="77"/>

with the words ‘what seems an infection of leprosy has appeared in my house’” and then it adds “and the priest shall command that they empty the house, before the priest enters the house and sees it, and whatsoever is in the house shall not become unclean, and after that the priest shall go in to observe it”
(Lev. xiv.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="132"><p> 34–36). So then before the priest goes in,

the things in the house are clean, but after he has gone in they are all unclean. And yet we should have expected just the opposite, that when a man who has been purified and fully consecrated, who is wont to offer prayers and litanies and sacrifices for all men, has come within the house, its contents should thereby be bettered and pass from impurity into purity. But here we find that they do not even remain in the same position as before, but actually shift into the inferior region at the entrance of the priest.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="133"><p>  Now whether in the plain and


literal sense of the ordinance these things are consistent with each other is a matter for those who are used to such questions and find pleasure in them. But <hi rend="italic">we</hi> must say positively that no two things can be more consistent with each other than that, when the priest has entered, the belongings of the house are defiled.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="134"><p> For so long as the divine reason has not

come into our soul, as to some dwelling-place, all its works are free from guilt, since the priest who is its guardian or father or teacher—or whatever name is fitting for him—the priest, who alone can admonish and bring it to wisdom, is far away. There is pardon for those whose sin is due to ignorance, because they have no experience to tell them what they should do. For they do not even conceive of their deeds as sins, nay often they think that their most grievous

<pb n="79"/>

stumblings are righteous actions.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="135"><p> But when the true

priest, Conviction, enters us, like a pure ray of light, we see in their real value the unholy thoughts that were stored within our soul, and the guilty and blameworthy actions to which we laid our hands in ignorance of our true interests. So Conviction, discharging his priest-like task, defiles all these
<note n="3.79.a">See App. p. 489.</note>
  and bids them all be cleared out and carried away, that he may see the soul’s house in its natural bare condition, and heal whatever sicknesses have arisen in it.

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="136"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="29"/> We have a parallel to this in the widow in

the Book of Kings who discourses with the prophet (1 Kings xvii. 10). She is a widow, not in our sense of the word, when the wife has lost her husband, but because she is widowed of the passions which corrupt and maltreat the mind, like Tamar in the books of Moses.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="137"><p> Tamar was bidden to remain a

widow in the house of her father, her one and only saviour (Gen. xxxviii. 11), for whose sake she has left for ever the intercourse and society of mortals, and remained desolate and widowed of human pleasures. Thus she receives the divine impregnation, and, being filled with the seeds of virtue, bears them in her womb and is in travail with noble actions. And when she has brought them to the birth, she wins the meed of conquest over her adversaries, and is enrolled as victor with the palm as the symbol of her victory. For Tamar is by interpretation a palm.  To return to the Book of Kings.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="138"><p> Every

mind that is on the way to be widowed and empty of evil says to the prophet, “O man of God, thou hast come in to remind me of my iniquity and my sin” (1 Kings xvii. 18). For when he, the God-inspired,
has entered the soul—he who is mastered

<pb n="81"/>

by celestial yearning, stirred to his very depth by the irresistible goads of god-sent frenzy, he creates a memory of past iniquities and sins, and this not to the end that the soul should return to them, but that, with deep groaning and many tears for its old error, it should turn therefrom with loathing for all that it has engendered, and follow instead the guidance of that reason which is the interpreter and prophet of God.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="139"><p> For the men of old days called the

prophets sometimes “men of God” and sometimes
“seers” (1 Sam. ix. 9). And the names they gave were names of literal truth and well suited, the former to their inspiration, the latter to the wide vision of reality which they possessed.

“his” (αὐτοῦ) cannot be properly used with reference to the feminine noun “flesh” (σάρξ). But perhaps<milestone unit="section" n="142"/>

the writer is not speaking merely of the flesh which corrupts its own way, thus giving reasonable grounds for the idea of a grammatical error, but of two things, the flesh which is being corrupted, and Another, whose way that flesh seeks to mar and corrupt. And so the passage must be explained thus, “all flesh destroyed the perfect way of the Eternal and Indestructible, the way which leads to God.”</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="143"><p> This way,

that we may not be forced to turn aside and have dealings with the vices that war against us, let us wish and pray that we may walk straightly along the middle path or mean.

  Courage is the mean between rashness and cowardice, economy between

careless extravagance and illiberal parsimony, prudence between knavery and folly, and finally piety between superstition and impiety.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="165"><p> These lie in the

middle between the deviations to either side, all of them high roads meet for the traveller’s use, wherein we are bound in duty

  to walk continually, not with the mechanism of the body, but with the motions of the soul which seeks the best.
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="166"><p><milestone unit="para"/>Angered greatly at this, Edom, the earthly one,

since he fears lest the principles of his creed be confounded and overthrown, will threaten to wage war to the bitter end, if we should force our way through his land, tearing and ravaging ever, as we go, the fruits of his soul which he has sown for the destruction of wisdom, though he has not reaped them. For he says, “Thou shalt not go through me, else I will come out in war to meet thee.”</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="167"><p> But let

us take no heed of his menaces, but make answer,
“We will go along the mountain country.” That is,
“It is our wont to hold converse with powers that are lofty and sublime, and to examine each point by analysis and definition, and to search out in everything whatsoever its rationale, by which its essential nature
<note n="3.93.b">See App. p. 489.</note>
  is known. Thus we feel contempt for all that is external or of the body; for these are low-lying
and grovelling exceedingly. You love them, but we hate them, and therefore we will handle none of them.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="168"><p> | For if we do but touch them


with our finger-tips, as the saying is, we shall provide honour and ‘value’ to you. You will plume yourself and boast that we too, the virtue-lovers, have yielded to the snares of pleasure.”

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="169"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="36"/> “For

if I or my cattle drink of your water,” it runs, “I

shall give you value.” The writer does not mean the pelf, to use the poet’s word, silver or gold or aught else which the purchaser is wont to give in exchange to the vendor, but by “value” he here means honour.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="170"><p>
<note n="3.95.a">i.e. the ambiguous word τιμή is here used in the sense of an honour conferred (γέρας). The position of the τό however, in the predicate is strange. Perhaps read τό “τιμήν” γέρας. A scribe failing to understand this use of τό before a quoted word or phrase might easily transfer it to before the neuter noun γέρας.</note>
  For in very truth everyone that is

profligate or cowardly or unjust, when he sees any of the stricter folk shrinking from toil or mastered by gain or swerving aside to any of the love-lures of pleasure, rejoices and is glad and thinks that he has received honour. And then with swaggering airs and gestures of pride he begins to hold forth sagely to the multitude about his own vices, how necessary and profitable they are, “for,” says he, “were they not so, would So-and-so, that much respected gentleman, be willing to indulge in them?</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="171"><p> “Let us say,

then, to everyone of this sorry sort, “If we drink of thy water, if we touch aught that thy confused and turbid current carries, we shall provide thee with honour and acceptance, instead of the ill-repute and dishonour that are thy true deserts.”</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="172"><p>  For in very truth “the matter” which has so engaged


thy zeal is absolutely “nothing.” Or dost thou think that aught of mortal matters has real being or subsistence, and that they do not rather swing suspended as it were on fallacious and unstable opinion, treading the void and differing not a whit from false dreams?</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="173"><p>  If thou carest


not to test the fortunes of individual men, scan the vicissitudes, for better and worse, of whole regions and nations. Greece was once at its zenith, but the



<pb n="97"/>

Macedonians took away its power. Macedonia flourished in its turn, but when it was divided into portions it weakened till it was utterly extinguished.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="174"><p> Before the Macedonians fortune smiled on the

Persians, but a single day destroyed their vast and mighty empire, and now Parthians rule over Persians, the former subjects over their masters of yesterday. The breath that blew from Egypt of old was clear and strong for many a long year, yet like a cloud its great prosperity passed away. What of the Ethiopians, what of Carthage, and the parts towards Libya? What of the kings of Pontus?</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="175"><p>

What of Europe and Asia, and in a word the whole civilized world? Is it not tossed up and down and kept in turmoil like ships at sea, subject now to prosperous, now to adverse winds?</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="176"><p>  For


circlewise moves the revolution of that divine plan which most call fortune. Presently in its ceaseless flux it makes distribution city by city, nation by nation, country by country. What these had once, those have now. What all had, all have. Only from time to time is the ownership changed by its agency, to the end that the whole of our world should be as a single state, enjoying that best of constitutions, democracy.

themselves there is no solid work, no “matter,” only a shadow or a breath which flits past, before it has real existence. It comes and goes as in the ebb and flow of the sea. For the tides sometimes race violently, roaring as they sweep along, and in their wide-spread rush make a lake of what till now was dry land, and then again they retreat and turn into land what was a great tract of sea.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="178"><p> Even so the good



<pb n="99"/>

fortune which has flooded a great and populous nation sometimes turns the stream of its current elsewhere and leaves not even a tiny trickle behind it, that no trace of the old richness may remain.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="179"><p>  But it is not all who can estimate these

truths justly and fully. Only they can do so who are wont to follow the rule of definition and reason which is straight and constant. The two sayings, “the matter of creation is all of it nothing” and “we will journey along the mountain country,” come from the mouths of the same speakers.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="180"><p> For it cannot be

that he who does not walk in the upland paths of definition should renounce mortal things and turn aside therefrom and make his new home with things indestructible.
<milestone unit="para"/>So then the earthly Edom purposes to bar the heavenly and royal road of virtue, but the divine reason on the other hand would bar the road of Edom and his associates.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="181"><p>  In the list of


these associates we must write the name of Balaam. For he too is no heavenly growth, but a creature of earth. And here we have the proof. He followed omens and false soothsayings, and not even when the closed eye of his soul received its sight and
“beheld the angel of God standing in his way”
(Num. xxii. 31) did he turn aside and refrain from evil-doing, but let the stream of his folly run full course and was overwhelmed by it and swallowed up.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="182"><p> For it is then that the ailments of the soul become

not only hard to tend, but even utterly beyond healing, when though Conviction fronts us, Conviction, the divine reason, the angel who guides our feet and removes the obstacles before them, that we may walk without stumbling along the high road

<pb n="101"/>

(Psalm xc. [xci.] 11, 12), we yet set our ill-judged purposes before those counsels of his which he is wont to give without ceasing for our admonishing and chastening and the reformation of our whole life.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="183"><p> Therefore he who listens not, who is not turned from

his course by the Conviction which stands in his path, will in time receive destruction “with the wounded”
(Num. xxxi. 8) whom their passions stabbed and wounded with a fatal stroke. His fate will be to those who are not hopelessly impure a lesson which heeds no confirmation, that they should seek to have the favour of the inward judge. And have it they shall, if they do not remove or repeal aught of the righteous judgements which he has given.
