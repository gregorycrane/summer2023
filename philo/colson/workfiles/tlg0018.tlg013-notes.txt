<note n="4.14.2">The translation follows Mangey in assuming that μὴ
alone has been omitted in the MSS. Wend. (<hi rend="italic">Rhein. Mus.</hi> liii.

too much a mere repetition of the first part. He suggested

<note n="4.16.1">Perhaps, as Wend. conjectures, &lt;τὴν&gt; τῶν.</note>



<note n="4.17.a">The thought seems to be that the confusion of languages did but divide nation from nation, and a single evil nation can do all the mischief.</note>




<note n="4.18.1">The sentence as it stands cannot be translated. Wend.,
who places the lacuna after ἀφιλονείκως and inserts &lt;ταμιευόμενοι&gt;,
is no doubt right in assuming that a participle must be
supplied. But if one word has been lost, it is not improbable
that others have been lost. With his reading the whole
sentence is an elaborate compliment to the literalists, which
is not paralleled elsewhere, though occasionally, as in § 190, a
certain amount of respect for them is shown. But the overwhelming
argument against his view is φαμὲν τοίνυν, which
cannot make an antithesis to ἰδίᾳ μὲν but presupposes a δέ
clause. <hi rend="italic">Cf. De Somn.</hi> i. 102 ταῦτα μὲν δὴ καὶ τὰ τοιαῦτα πρὸς
τοὺς τῆς ῥητῆς πραγματείας σοφιστὰς . . εἰρήσθω, λέγωμεν δὲ
ἡμεῖς ἑπόμενοι τοῖς ἀλληγορίας νόμοις τὰ πρέποντα περὶ τούτων.
φαμὲν τοίνυν λόγον σύμβολον ἱμάτιον εἶναι. Philo in my
view is describing his own method and says that he will not enter into direct conflict with the unbelievers, but show that the passage, if logically treated on the allegorical method, makes a reasonable whole. What the words lost are, one can only conjecture. It would be enough perhaps to insert &lt;ὰκριβοῦντες, ἡμεῖς δὲlarge&gt;, <hi rend="italic">sc.</hi> διελέγξομεν. But perhaps it is more likely that there were some words describing the allegorical method, ending with an homoioteleuton to γραφῆς, e.g. &lt;ἀκριβοῦντες, ἡμεῖς δὲ ἀλληγοροῦντες διερμηνεύσομεν τὸ ἐγκείμενον ἐν τῇ γραφῇ&gt;. <hi rend="italic">cf.

<note n="4.36.1">MSS. οὔτε, which is quite impossible. Wend., who retains

E.V. “and on the elders of Israel he laid not his hand.”
Here clearly διαφωνεῖν means “to perish,” and so perhaps in Num. xxxi. 49. rather than “failed to answer his name.”
Philo probably understood this, but for the purpose of his musical allegory gives the word its literal meaning.</note>




<note n="4.42.1">Perhaps ἑξῆς &lt;δὲ&gt;. Wend. places a lacuna before ἑξῆς,
Cohn after it, corrected to ἐξ ἧς. Neither gives any suggestion
as to what this lacuna contained. My reasons for
thinking that there is no such lacuna are given in note <hi rend="italic">a</hi>
below.</note>



<note n="4.43.a">The course of the thought, as I understand, is this. By
close examination, particularly of the senses (§§ 52, 53), we
obtain a mastery of them, and thus reach the harmony of
which the Captains of Num. xxxi. spoke (§ 55). This involves the conviction of the untrustworthiness of all created things, and thus brings the Captains into line with Phinehas, whose ripping up of the “woman” γένεσις meant the same thing. Thus the prize of true peace goes first to Phinehas, but also in their turn (ἑξῆς) to the Captains. Historically, of course, they are linked with Phinehas, who was their leader in the war against Midian.</note>

<note n="4.53.a">The LXX of course intended no such distinction between
κατοίκει and παροίκει, or between the land of the first half and
that of the second half of the verse.</note>




<note n="4.55.a">The fanciful thought is as follows: What we speak is
words not things. Therefore when God “speaks a land”
(meaning virtues), those virtues are God’s words. He has
this much excuse that εἴπω followed by the things spoken
of is doubtful Greek.</note>

<note n="4.60.1">Mangey suggests inserting after γεώδη: &lt;ἐπιτηδεύειν&gt;
(rather μήτε ἐπιτηδεύειν). This would avoid the zeugma of
associating διαπλάττειν with the ἔργα οἰνοχόων.</note>


<note n="4.60.2">ὃς δὴ λόγος ἐστί] this is my conjecture for the ὃς δῆλός
ἐστι of all MSS. and editions. It is based (1) on <hi rend="italic">De Som.</hi>
i. 62, where Philo discussing the three senses in which τόπος
is used declares that one of these is the Divine Logos and
that this is the sense in which it is used in this passage,
Ex. xxiv. 10 (the same idea that τόπος=λόγος appears in
<hi rend="italic">De Op.</hi> 20 and <hi rend="italic">De Som.</hi> i. 117): (2) on the sequel in § 97,
where the identification of the τόπος ᾧ ὁ θεὸς ἐφέστηκε with
the λόγος is clearly implied. The simple alteration of the
somewhat pointless δῆλος to δὴ λόγος makes this identification,
which otherwise comes in very abruptly, perfectly clear.
The use of δή with the relative constantly recurs in Philo.</note>


<note n="4.60.3">Wend. τά θ᾿—evidently wrongly. The δέ is required to
balance the μέν and to mark the antithesis between the Logos
and the Sensible World.</note>


<note n="4.60.4">πλίνθου] MSS.. λίθου.</note>



<note n="4.61.a">LXX. εἷδον τὸν τόπον οὗ εἱστήκει ὁ θεὸς τοῦ Ἰσραήλ. E.V. “They saw the God of Israel.”</note>


<note n="4.61.b">So, as the sequel shows, rather than “the place on which He stands.” This use of ἐφέστηκε with the dative may be paralleled, e.g. ἐπέστη τοῖς κατὰ τὸ Ῥηγίον τόποις, Polybius ix. 7. 10. Perhaps, however, read ἐνέστηκε. In <hi rend="italic">De Som.</hi> i. 62 we have the οὗ είστήκει of the LXX</note>


<note n="4.61.c">Or perhaps Philo may have taken the words to mean
“like a kind of basis for the heaven.” Though in <hi rend="italic">De Op</hi>. 36 he makes στερέωμα = the heaven, his identification of it here with the αἰσθητὸς κόσμος points to the latter interpretation.</note>




<note n="4.62.1">MSS. οἰκονομῶν.</note>



<note n="4.63.a">See App. p. 555.</note>

of the text introduced by διὸ καὶ ἐπιλέγεται. But the words
introduce a totally different thought from that which is given
in §§ 101 and 102. Philo, as often, cites the text without any
λέγεται or φησί.</note>


<note n="4.64.4">MSS.. and all editions δεδεμένον. But “bound” is hardly sense. Mangey translates “substructiones,” Stein “Gebilde,”
Yonge “buildings,” which suggest that they all took it from
δέμω. But this is surely impossible. Possibly we might read δεμόμενον or τόδε τὸ μανὸν.</note>

<note n="4.67.a">The word is used here and in § 106 to preserve the obvious
play between ἀσφαλής and ἄσφαλτος.</note>


<note n="4.67.b">The antithesis intended is that while the Noah-mind in
its lower stages, when the sensible world is so absorbing, finds
in the ark of the body a source of strength, which it will
discard when the stress is past, the higher Moses-mind,
which receives the Stoic name of ἀστεῖος from the first, never rests contented with it, but recognizes from the first, that the “asphalt” which serves the body, can never give the real “safety.” See further, App. p. 555.</note>




<note n="4.68.1">I cannot think that the phrase θεοῦ δὲ ὕμνος ἡ τοιάδε is
right. And Cohn’s and Wend.’s suggestions of (1) εὐνομωτάτη
δ᾿, (2) θεοῦ δ᾿ ὄπαδος, (3) εὐδόκιμος seem to me quite wild.
The only variants in the MSS. are ἤτοι ᾄδεται and ἡ τοιαιδέτε
for ἡ τοιάδε. From this I conjecture θεοῦ δ᾿ &lt;ὲν&gt; ὕμνο&lt;ι&gt;ς ἡ
τοιάδε ᾄδεται, i.e. such a soul-city or such a πολιτεία is called in
the Psalms God’s (city). I understand Philo to be alluding
to the use of the phrase “the city of God” in Ps. xlvi. 4 and lxxxvii. 3. To interpret the phrase as meaning a just soul or a just condition of civic life is as natural for him as for a Christian to apply it to the Church. Philo regularly quotes the Psalms with the words ἐν ὕμνοις, as e.g. above 52, <hi rend="italic">De Som</hi>. ii. 242 ἐπεὶ καὶ ἐν ὕμνοις ᾄδεται. See also App. p. 555.</note>

ordinary usage of Greek demands the nominative when
referring to the subject of the main verb, and this is usually,
if not always, followed by Philo, e.g. ἀδικοῦντες 120.</note>




<note n="4.77.a">This conception of wickedness as being in one sense
immortal, though at the same time a perpetual process of
dying to the true life, is Philo’s interpretation of the sign
given to Cain that no one should kill him (Gen. iv. 15), coupled with the absence of any mention of his death in Genesis. <hi rend="italic">Cf. Quod Det.</hi> 177, <hi rend="italic">De Fuga</hi> 60.</note>

<note n="4.84.1">I have not attempted to translate these corrupt words
which appear in Mangey’s edition as οὗ χάριν μελίσας ᾄσω
(“on account of which I will celebrate it in song”!) Wend.
suggested θεοῦ χάρισιν συνημμένα with no lacuna. But this
bears little resemblance to the text. I suggest οὗ χάριν
&lt;ἔ&gt;μελ&lt;λ&gt;ε τῆς ἀσω&lt;μάτου&gt;, followed by some such words as
οὐσίας πληροῦσθαι. This will fit the argument well. God is
everywhere, because His binding things with invisible bonds
necessarily (ἔμελλε) involves His filling all things with
His being.</note>


<note n="4.84.2">Wend. suggests &lt;οὐκ&gt; ἐπινοεῖται περὶ τόπον, οὐ κατα-
&lt;λαμβανόμενον, εἰ μὴ κατὰ&gt; τὸ εἶναι μόνον. As an alternative
I suggest ἐπινοεῖται πέρα τοῦ εἶναί που κατὰ τὸ εἶναι μόνον (“is
conceived of as transcending the idea of being in any particular
place and in terms of existence only”). See App. p. 556.</note>


<note n="4.84.3">This sentence has been completely confused in the MSS. Wend, reconstructs it as follows: τὸ δὴ θεῖον ὁρατόν τε

<note n="4.105.d">For the leading ideas of the following sections, viz. God as the cause of good alone and His employment of subordinates, see notes on <hi rend="italic">De Op.</hi> 72, and <hi rend="italic">De Agr,</hi> 128, with the references to Plato there given.</note>




<note n="4.106.1">The insertion is perhaps unnecessary, as ὑπηρεσίας (which
Mangey suggested in preference to συμπράξεως) might possibly
be understood from the previous sentence.</note>


<note n="4.106.2">Wend. suggests ἐξουσίαν, cf. § 181. If alteration is required,
I should prefer ἐπιστασίαν. <hi rend="italic">Cf. De Cher.</hi> 24.</note>


<note n="4.106.3">MSS. ὡς ταῦτα or ὡς ταῦτῃ.</note>


<note n="4.106.4">So Wend, and Mangey: MSS. νοῦ, which might be defended as equivalent to the ψυχὴ λογική below.</note>




<note n="4.108.1">MSS. ἐμπρεπέστατα.</note>


<note n="4.108.2">MSS. τῶν ἀρίστων or τὸν ἄριστον.</note>




<note n="4.111.a">Philo here seems to assign the work of punishment
to the lower division of the ministers rather than to the
Potencies, though elsewhere he treats it as belonging to the
Kingly Potency indicated by the name of ὁ Κύριος, <hi rend="italic">e.g.
De Abr.</hi> 144, 145. Here the “angels” have the whole
province of evil assigned to them, whether to save from it,
as with Jacob, or to inflict it.</note>


<note n="4.111.b">See App. p. 558 on this and the following sections.</note>


<note n="4.111.c">See App. p. 558.</note>




<note n="4.112.1">MSS. μίαν.</note>


<note n="4.112.2">MSS. ἐπὶ.</note>


<note n="4.112.3">MSS. ἀφιέναι.</note>



<note n="4.113.a">See App. p. 558.</note>


<note n="4.113.b">Lit. “another single special power.” This use of
δύναμις which suggests both “nature” and “value” cannot
be translated by any single or at least any singular word. For this use of ἐξαίρετος <hi rend="italic">cf. De Op.</hi> 62, where the senses have each their ἐξαίρετος ὕλη.</note>




<note n="4.115.a">Or more literally “the destruction of the simple uncompounded
natures, to produce a single compounded nature.”</note>


<note n="4.115.b">i.e. Moses, not God. Philo often calls God ὁ μόνος
σοφός, but not ὁ σοφός. The command is thought of as
emanating from Moses, because the language in which it is
clothed is his.</note>




<note n="4.116.1">So Wend.; <hi rend="italic">cf. De Ebr.</hi> 190: MSS. ἐνστοματίας or ἐν
στόματι. The latter does not seem impossible.</note>


<note n="4.116.2">MSS. καὶ εἰ . . . ἀφῄρηται.</note>




<note n="4.118.1">MSS. κακίαν.</note>



<note n="4.119.a">i.e. the two ideas which have been connected with
σύγχυσις are φθορά and διασπορά. The first of these is here expressed by ἀδόκιμος which often means something not merely worthless but cast away as such. The second is expressed by πεφορημένος. But see App. p. 559.</note>
