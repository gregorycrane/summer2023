<head>Concerning Noah’s Work as a Planter</head>
<head>Book II</head>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="1"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="1"/> We have said in the former book all that the

occasion called for regarding the husbandman’s art in general. In this book we shall give such an account as we can of the art of a vine-dresser in particular. For Moses introduces the righteous man not as a husbandman only, but specially as a vine-dresser; his words are: “Noah began to be a husbandman tilling the ground, and he planted a vineyard”
(Gen. ix.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="2"><p> 20).  It is incumbent on one,


who is going to discourse on the work of planters and husbandmen as carried on in this or that place, to begin by marking well the plants set in the universe, those most perfect of all plants, and their great Planter and Overseer. It is the Lord of all things that is the greatest of planters and most perfect Master of His art. It is this World that is a plant containing in itself the particular plants all at once in their myriads, like shoots springing from a single root.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="3"><p> For, when the Framer of the World, finding

all that existed confused and disordered of itself, began to give it form, by bringing it out of disorder into order, out of confusion into distinction of parts, He caused earth and water to occupy the position of

<pb n="215"/>

roots at its centre; the trees, that are air and fire, He drew up from the centre to the space on high; the encircling region of ether He firmly established, and set it to be at once a boundary and guard of all that is within. (Apparently its name “Heaven” is derived from the former word.<ref target="3-215-a"/> ) And (surpassing wonder!) this Doer of wondrous works caused earth, a dry substance in danger of being dissolved by water, to be held by<ref target="3-215-b"/>  water, and air, of itself coldest of all things, to be held by fire whose very nature is heat.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="4"><p> How can it be other than a prodigy that the

dissolving element should be held together by that which it dissolves, water by earth; and that on the coldest element the hottest should be seated un-quenched, fire upon air?  The elements
of which we have spoken are the perfect branches of the whole, but the stock, far greater and more productive than all of them, is this world, of which the growths that have been mentioned are offshoots.

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="5"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="2"/> We must consider, therefore, where He caused its

roots to strike, and on what it rests as a statue on its pedestal. It is unlikely that any material body has been left over and was moving about at random outside, seeing that God had wrought up and placed in orderly position all matter wherever found.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="6"><p> For it

became the greatest artificer to fashion to full perfection the greatest of constructions, and it would have come short of full perfection, had it not had a complement of perfect parts.<ref target="3-215-b"/>  Accordingly this world of ours was formed out of all that there is of earth, and all that there is of water, and air and fire, not even the smallest particle being left outside. It 7 follows that outside there is either empty space or nothing at all. If there is empty space, how comes

<pb n="217"/>

it that a thing that is full and dense and heaviest of all existences does not sink down by sheer weight, having nothing solid external to it to hold it up? This would seem to be of the nature of a phantom, since our understanding ever looks for a material basis, which it expects everything to have, even if it be but an empty thing, but above all the world, since it is the largest of material bodies, and holds in its bosom as parts of itself amass of other material bodies.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="8"><p> Let anyone then, who would fain escape the confusion

of face, which we all feel when we have to leave problems unsolved, say plainly that no material thing is so strong as to be able to bear the burden of the world; and that the everlasting Word of the eternal God is the very sure and staunch prop of the Whole.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="9"><p>  He it is, who extending Himself


from the midst to its utmost bounds and from its extremities to the midst again, keeps up through all its length Nature’s unvanquished course, combining and compacting all its parts. For the Father Who begat Him constituted His Word such a Bond of the Universe as nothing can break.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="10"><p> Good reason, then,

have we to be sure that all the earth shall not be dissolved by all the water which has gathered within its hollows; nor fire be quenched by air; nor, on the other hand, air be ignited by fire. The Divine Word stations Himself to keep these elements apart, like a Vocal between voiceless elements of speech, that the universe may send forth a harmony like that of a masterpiece of literature.<ref target="3-217-a"/>  He mediates between the opponents amid their threatenings, and reconciles them by winning ways to peace and concord.

<pb n="219"/>

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="11"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="3"/> On this wise was the tree


planted which yields all fruit that grows. On this wise when planted was it held fast. Among lesser plants, that did not partake of its universal character, some were created with a capacity of moving from one place to another, others, meant to be stationary, lacked such capacity for change of place.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="12"><p> Our name

for those which have the power of locomotion is animals. These took to (i.e. were so made as naturally to belong to) the several main divisions of our universe, land animals to earth, to water those that swim, the winged creatures to air, and to fire the fire-born. It is said that the production of these last is more patent to observation in Macedonia than elsewhere. The stars found their place in heaven. Those who have made philosophy their study tell us that these too are living creatures, but of a kind composed entirely of Mind. Of these some, the planets, appear to change their position by a power inherent in themselves, others to do so as they are swept along in the rush of our universe, and these we call fixed stars.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="13"><p><ref target="3-219-a"/>   The creations endowed


with a nature incapable of taking in impressions, to which the name of “plants” is specially given, do not share the power of locomotion.

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="14"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="4"/> Of twofold kind were the beings which the great

Maker made as well in the earth as in the air. In the air He made the winged creatures perceived by our senses, and other mighty beings besides which are wholly beyond apprehension by sense. This is the host of the bodiless souls. Their array is made up of companies that differ in kind. We are told that some enter into mortal bodies, and quit them again at certain fixed periods, while others, endowed with

<pb n="221"/>

a diviner constitution, have no regard for any earthly quarter, but exist on high nigh to the ethereal region itself. These are the purest spirits of all, whom Greek philosophers call heroes, but whom Moses, employing a well-chosen name, entitles
“angels,” for they go on embassies bearing tidings from the great Ruler to His subjects of the boons which He sends them, and reporting to the Monarch what His subjects are in need of. | Two
kinds again did He assign to earth, land animals and plants. For He willed her to be at once both mother and nurse.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="15"><p> For, even as in woman and all female

kind there well up springs of milk when the time of delivery draws near, that they may furnish necessary drink of a suitable kind to their offspring; even so in like manner did the Creator bestow on earth, the mother of land animals, plants of all sorts, to the end that the new-born might have the benefit of nourishment not foreign but akin to them.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="16"><p> Furthermore,

while He fashioned the plants head downwards, fixing their heads in the portions of the earth where the soil lay deepest, He raised from the earth the heads of the animals that are without reason and set them on the top of a long neck, placing the fore feet as a support for the neck.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="17"><p> But the build allotted to man

was distinguished above that of other living creatures. For by turning the eyes of the others downwards He made them incline to the earth beneath them. The eyes of man, on the contrary, He set high up, that he might gaze on heaven, for man, as the old saying is, is a plant not earthly but heavenly.<ref target="3-221-a"/> 

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="18"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="5"/> Now while

others, by asserting that our human mind is a particle


<pb n="223"/>

of the ethereal substance, have claimed for man a kinship with the upper air; our great Moses likened the fashion of the reasonable soul to no created thing, but averred it to be a genuine coinage of that dread Spirit, the Divine and Invisible One, signed and impressed by the seal of God, the stamp of which is the Eternal Word.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="19"><p> His words are “God in-breathed

into his face a breath of Life” (Gen. ii. 7); so that it cannot but be that he that receives is made in the likeness of Him Who sends forth the breath. Accordingly we also read that man has been made after the Image of God (Gen. i. 27), not however after the image of anything created.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="20"><p> It followed then, as a

natural consequence of man’s soul having been made after the image of the Archetype, the Word of the First Cause, that his body also was made erect, and could lift up its eyes to heaven, the purest portion of our universe, that by means of that which he could see man might clearly apprehend that which he could not see.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="21"><p> Since, then, it was impossible for

any to discern how the understanding tends towards the Existent One, save those only who had been drawn by Him—for each one of us knows what he has himself experienced as no other can know it—He
endows the bodily eyes with the power of taking the direction of the upper air, and so makes them a distinct representation of the invisible eye.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="22"><p> For,

seeing that the eyes formed out of perishable matter obtained so great reach as to travel from the earthly region to heaven, that is so far away, and to touch its bounds, how vast must we deem the flight in all directions of the eyes of the soul? The strong yearning to perceive the Existent One gives them wings to attain not only to the furthest region of the upper

<pb n="225"/>

air, but to overpass the very bounds of the entire universe and speed away toward the Uncreate.

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="23"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="6"/> This is why those who crave for

wisdom and knowledge with insatiable persistence are said in the Sacred Oracles to have been called upwards; for it accords with God’s ways that those who have received His down-breathing should be called up to Him.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="24"><p> For when trees are whirled up,

roots and all, into the air by hurricanes and tornadoes, and heavily laden ships of large tonnage are snatched up out of mid-ocean, as though objects of very little weight, and lakes and rivers are borne aloft, and earth’s hollows are left empty by the water as it is drawn up by a tangle of violently eddying winds, it is strange if a light substance like the mind is not rendered buoyant and raised to the utmost height by the native force of the Divine spirit, overcoming as it does in its boundless might all powers that are here below. Above all is it strange if this is not so with the mind of the genuine philosopher.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="25"><p> Such an one suffers from no weight of downward

pressure towards the objects dear to the body and to earth. From these he has ever made an earnest effort to sever and estrange himself. So he is borne upward insatiably enamoured of all holy happy natures that dwell on high.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="26"><p> Accordingly Moses,

the keeper and guardian of the mysteries of the Existent One, will be one called above; for it is said in the Book of Leviticus, “He called Moses up above”
(Lev. i. 1). One called up above will Bezeleel also be, held worthy of a place in the second rank. For him also does God call up above for the construction and overseeing of the sacred works (Exod. xxxi.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="27"><p> 2 ff.). But while Bezeleel shall carry off the lower honours



<pb n="227"/>

conferred by the call above, Moses the all-wise shall bear away the primary honours. For the former fashions the shadows, just as painters do, to whom Heaven has not granted power to create aught that has life. “Bezeleel,” we must remember, means
“making in shadows.” Moses on the other hand obtained the office of producing not shadows but the actual archetype of the several objects. Nor need we wonder at such distinctions. It is the wont of the Supreme Cause to exhibit the objects proper to each, to some in a clearer, more radiant vision, as though in unclouded sunshine, to others more dimly, as though in the shade.

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="28"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="7"/> As we have now brought to a close our discussion


of those objects on a larger scale which are set to grow in the field of the universe, let us note the way in which God the all-wise fashioned the trees that are in man, the microcosm. To begin with, then, He took our body, as though He were taking some deep-soiled plot of ground and made the organs of sense as tree-beds for it.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="29"><p> Having done this He

set a sense in each of them, as a plant highly valuable for cultivation, hearing in the ear, sight in the eyes, in the nostrils scent, and the rest in their appropriate and congenial positions. I may cite as a witness to what I say the sacred poet, where he says “He that planteth the ear, doth He not hear? He that fashioneth the eyes, shall He not behold?” (Psalm xciv.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="30"><p> 9). And all the other faculties of the body

including legs and hands and every part, whether inner or outer, are nothing else than noble shoots and growths.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="31"><p> The better and more perfect growths He

planted in the dominant faculty, which holds the central position, and possesses in a pre-eminent

<pb n="229"/>

degree the capacity for yielding fruit. These growths are insight, apprehension, accurate judgement, constant practice, powers of memory, varying conditions, chronic dispositions,<ref target="3-229-a"/>  scientific capacity taking many forms and directions, certainty of knowledge, ability to take in and retain the principles and implications of virtue in every shape. Not one of these is any mortal man whatever capable of growing. The One Grower of them all is the Uncreate Artificer, Who not only has made these plants once for all, but is ever making them in the case of each man who is from time to time begotten.

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="32"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="8"/> In agreement with what I have said is the

planting of the garden; for we read, “God planted a garden in Eden facing the sun-rising, and placed there the man whom He had moulded” (Gen. ii. 8). To imagine that he planted vines and olive and apple and pomegranate trees or the like, would be serious folly, difficult to eradicate. One would 33 naturally ask What for? To provide Himself with convenient places to live in?<ref target="3-229-b"/>  Would the whole world be considered a sufficient dwelling for God the Lord of all? Would it not evidently fall short in countless other ways<ref target="3-229-c"/>  of being deemed meet to receive the Great King? To say nothing of the irreverence of supposing that the Cause of all things is contained in that which He has caused, and to say nothing of the fact that the trees of His planting do not yield annual fruits as ours do.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="34"><p><ref target="3-229-d"/>  For whose use

and enjoyment, then, will the Garden yield its fruits? Not for that of any man; for no one whatever is mentioned as dwelling in the garden, for we are told that Adam, the man first moulded out of the earth,



<pb n="231"/>

migrated thence.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="35"><p> As for God, <hi rend="italic">He</hi> stands in no need of

food any more than of aught else. For one who uses food must in the first place experience need, and in the next place be equipped with organs by means of which to take the food that comes in, and to discharge that from which he has drawn its goodness. These things are not in harmony with the blessedness and happiness of the First Cause. They are utterly monstrous inventions of men who would overthrow great virtues like piety and reverence by representing Him as having the form and passions of mankind.

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="36"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="9"/> So we must turn to allegory, the method dear

to men with their eyes opened. Indeed the sacred oracles most evidently afford us the clues for the use of this method. For they say that in the garden there are trees in no way resembling those with which we are familiar, but trees of Life, of Immortality, of Knowledge, of Apprehension, of Understanding, of the conception of good and evil.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="37"><p> And

these can be no growths of earthly soil, but must be those of the reasonable soul, namely its path according to virtue with life and immortality as its end, and its path according to evil ending in the shunning of these and in death. We must conceive therefore that the bountiful God plants in the soul as it were a garden of virtues and of the modes of conduct corresponding to each of them, a garden that brings the soul to perfect happiness.
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="38"><p><milestone unit="para"/>Because of this He assigned to the garden a site

most suitable, bearing the name of “Eden,” which means “luxuriance,” symbol of a soul whose eyesight is perfect, disporting itself in virtues, leaping and skipping by reason of abundance of great joy, having set before it, as an enjoyment outweighing thousands

<pb n="233"/>

of those that men deem sweetest, the worship and service of the Only Wise.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="39"><p> One, after taking a sheer

draught of this bright joy, a member indeed of Moses’ fellowship, not found among the indifferent, spake aloud in hymns of praise, and addressing his own mind cried, “Delight in the Lord” (Psalm xxxvi. 4), moved by the utterance to an ecstasy of the love that is heavenly and Divine, filled with loathing for those interminable bouts of softness and debauchery amid the seeming and so-called good things of mankind, while his whole mind is snatched up in holy frenzy by a Divine possession, and he finds his gladness in God alone.

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="40"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="10"/> A proof of what I

have said is the nearness of the garden to the sun-rising
(Gen. ii. 8); for, while folly is a thing sinking, dark, night-bringing, wisdom is verily a thing of sunrise, all radiancy and brightness. And even as the sun, when it comes up, fills all the circle of heaven with light, even so do the rays of virtue, when they have shone out, cause the whole region of the understanding to be flooded with pure brilliancy.
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="41"><p><milestone unit="para"/>Now, whereas man’s possessions have animals of

great ferocity to watch and guard them against being attacked and overrun, the possessions of God are guarded by rational beings: for it says, “He stationed there the man whom He had fashioned,”
that is to say, the trainings in and exercises of the virtues belong to rational beings only.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="42"><p> This they

received at the hands of God, as a pre-eminent privilege above the lives of the irrational creatures. And that is why it is stated in the most vivid manner



<pb n="235"/>

possible that He set the mind, which is the real man in us, amid holiest shoots and growths of noble character, since among beings void of understanding there is not one capable of tilling virtues, for they are by nature utterly incompetent to apprehend these.

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="43"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="11"/> We need, then, be at no loss


to know why there are brought in into the ark, which was built at the time of the great Flood, all the kinds of wild beasts, but into the Garden no kind at all. For the ark was a figure of the body, which has been obliged to make room for the savage and untamed pests of passions and vices, whereas the garden was a figure of the virtues; and virtues entertain nothing wild, nothing (we may say outright) that is irrational.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="44"><p> | It is with deliberate care that the lawgiver

says not of the man made after God’s image, but of the man fashioned out of earth, that he was introduced into the garden. For the man stamped with the spirit which is after the image of God differs not a whit, as it appears to me, from the tree that bears the fruit of immortal life: for both are imperishable and have been accounted worthy of the most central and most princely portion: for we are told that the tree of Life is in the midst of the Garden (Gen. ii. 9). Nor is there any difference between the man fashioned out of the earth and the earthly composite body. He has no part in a nature simple and uncompounded, whose house and courts only the self-trainer knows how to occupy, even Jacob who is put before us as “a plain<ref target="3-235-a"/>  man dwelling in a house” (Gen. xxv.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="45"><p> 27). The earthy man has a disposition of versatile subtlety, fashioned and concocted of elements of all sorts It was to be expected,



<pb n="237"/>

then, that God should plant and set in the garden, or the whole universe, the middle or neutral mind, played upon by forces drawing it in opposite directions and given the high calling to decide between them, that it might be moved to choose and to shun, to win fame and immortality should it welcome the better, and incur a dishonourable death should it choose the worse.

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="46"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="12"/> Such, then, were the trees which He Who

alone is wise planted in rational souls. Moses, lamenting over those who had become exiles from the garden of the virtues, implores alike God’s absolute sovereignty and His gracious and gentle powers, that the people endowed with sight may be planted in on the spot whence the earthly mind, called Adam, has been banished.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="47"><p> This is what he says: “Bring them in, plant them in the mountain

of Thine inheritance, in the place, O Lord, which is ready, which Thou wroughtest for Thee to dwell in, the sanctuary, O Lord, which Thy hands have made ready: the Lord is sovereign for ever and ever” (Exod. xv.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="48"><p> 17 f.). So Moses, beyond all others, had

most accurately learned that God, by setting the seeds and roots of all things, is the Cause of the greatest of all plants springing up, even this universe. It is at this evidently that he points in the present instance by the words of the Song itself just quoted, by calling the world “the mountain of Thine inheritance,” since that which has been brought into being is, in a peculiar degree, the possession and portion of him who has made it.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="49"><p> So he prays that in this

we may be planted. He would not have us become irrational and unruly in our natures. Nay, he would have us comply with the ordering of the All-perfect,

<pb n="239"/>

and faithfully copying His constant and undeviating course, pursue without stumbling a life of self-mastery:
for to attain the power to live as nature bids has been pronounced by the men of old supreme happiness.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="50"><p><ref target="3-239-a"/>   And mark how well the


epithets that follow harmonize with that which was put first. The world, we read, is God’s house in the realm of sense-perception, prepared and ready for Him. It is a thing wrought, not, as some have fancied, uncreate. It is a “sanctuary,” an outshining of sanctity, so to speak, a copy of the original; since the objects that are beautiful to the eye of sense are images of those in which the understanding recognizes beauty. Lastly, it has been prepared by the “hands” of God, his world-creating powers.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="51"><p> And to the end that none may suppose that the

Maker is in need of those whom He has made, Moses will crown his utterance with the point that is vital beyond all others: “reigning for ever and ever.”
It is an established principle that a sovereign is dependent on no one, while subjects are in all respects dependent on the sovereign.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="52"><p> Some have

maintained that that which is God’s portion, and is spoken of here as such, is that which is good, and that Moses’ prayer in this instance is for the obtaining of the experience and enjoyment thereof. For his prayer runs thus: “Initiate<ref target="3-239-b"/>  us, the children just beginning to learn, by means of the pronouncements and principles of wisdom, and leave us not ungrounded, but plant us in a high and heavenly doctrine.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="53"><p><ref target="3-239-c"/> ” For this is a “portion” best prepared

a “house” most ready, an abode most fitting, which


<pb n="241"/>

“Thou hast wrought as a Holy Place”; for of things good and holy, O Master, Thou art Maker, as from the corruptible creation come things evil and profane. Reign through the age that has no limit over the soul that implores Thee, never leaving it for one moment without a sovereign Ruler: for never-ceasing
slavery under Thee surpasses not freedom only but the highest sovereignty.

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="54"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="13"/> It is


possible that the words “Into the mountain of Thine inheritance” may suggest to many an inquiry as to how to account for them: for that God <hi rend="italic">gives</hi> portions is a necessary truth, but it may appear a contradiction that He should <hi rend="italic">obtain</hi> a portion, since all things belong to Him.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="55"><p> This expression would seem

to apply to those who are on a special footing of more intimate relationship with Him as their Master. So kings are rulers of all their subjects, but in an eminent degree of their household servants, of whose ministry they are accustomed to avail themselves for the care of their persons and their other requirements.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="56"><p>  Again these same rulers, though

they are masters of all properties throughout the land, including those over which private citizens have apparent control, are reckoned to have those only which they place in the hands of bailiffs and agents, from which also they collect the yearly income. To these they frequently resort for holiday and enjoyment, laying aside the serious burden of the anxieties incident to government and sovereignty, and these estates of theirs go by the name of royal demesnes. Again, silver and gold, and other precious 57 things which are kept in the treasuries of subjects, belong to the rulers rather than to those who have them. But in spite of this we speak of sovereigns’

<pb n="243"/>

private coffers in which the appointed collectors of dues deposit the revenues from the country.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="58"><p> Marvel

not at all, then, if the title of special portion of God the universal Ruler, to whom sovereignty over all pertains, is bestowed upon the company of wise souls, whose vision is supremely keen, the eye of whose understanding is clear and flawless, closing never, ever open in a gaze direct and piercing.

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="59"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="14"/> Is

not this the explanation of that utterance in the Greater Song: “Ask thy father, and he will proclaim it to thee, thy elders, and they will tell it thee; when the Most High distributed the nations, when He dispersed the sons of Adam, He set up boundaries of the nations corresponding to the number of the angels of God, and His people Israel became the portion of the Lord” (Deut. xxxii.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="60"><p> 7–9)? Mark

how he has again given the name of “portion” and
“lot” of God to the character that has eyes to see Him and accords Him genuine devotion, while he says that the children of earth, whom he entitles sons of Adam, have been dispersed and broken up and no more gathered together but are become a mob incapable of following the guidance of right reason. For virtue is in very deed the cause of harmony and unity, whereas the contrary disposition brings about dissolution and dismemberment.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="61"><p>  An


illustration of what has been said is afforded by that which is done year by year on the day called the
“Day of Atonement.” It is enjoined on that day
“to assign by lot two goats, one for the Lord, and one for separation<ref target="3-243-a"/>  (Lev. xvi. 8), a twofold description,<ref target="3-243-b"/> 

<pb n="245"/>

one for God and one for created things. That which exalts the First Cause shall be allotted to Him, while that which exalts creation shall be banished, driven from the most holy places, to find itself amid rocky chasms in trackless and unhallowed regions.

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="62"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="15"/> So fully does Moses take advantage of the

prerogative of one beloved of God, that, inspired with confidence by this very fact, he is wont to use language and utter teachings larger and more daring than suit the ears of us feebler folk. For not only does he think it in accordance with God’s dignity to obtain a portion, but, what is strangest of all, Himself to be the portion of others.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="63"><p> For he deemed it meet and

right that a whole tribe, which had taken refuge at God’s footstool, should be allotted no part of the country, like the other eleven tribes, but should receive the pre-eminent privilege of the priesthood, a possession not earthly but heavenly. “The tribe of Levi,” he says, “shall have no lot or portion among the children of Israel, for the Lord is their portion”
(Deut. x. 9); and there is an utterance rung out on this wise by the holy oracles in the name of God,
“I am thy portion and inheritance” (Numb. xviii.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="64"><p> 20): for in reality the mind, which has been perfectly

cleansed and purified, and which renounces all things pertaining to creation, is acquainted with One alone, and knows but One, even the Uncreate, to Whom it has drawn nigh, by Whom also it has been taken to Himself. For who is at liberty to say “God Himself is alone (and all) to me,” save one who has no welcome for aught that comes after Him? And this is the Levite attitude of mind, for the word means “He (is precious) to me,” the thought conveyed being that while different things have been held precious by

<pb n="247"/>

different people, he is alone<ref target="3-247-a"/>  in holding precious the original<ref target="3-247-b"/>  and worthiest Cause of all things.

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="65"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="16"/> They say<ref target="3-247-c"/>  that in olden time one who was enraptured

by the beauty of wisdom, as by that of some distinguished lady, after watching the array of a procession pass by on which vast sums had been lavished, fastened his eyes on a group of his associates and said, “See, my friends, of how many things I have no need.” And yet he was wearing absolutely nothing beyond necessary clothing, so that he cannot be supposed to have been puffed up by his great riches, as countless thousands have been, and to have uttered the words as a boast.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="66"><p> This is the mind

which, as the lawgiver insists, should be that of those who provide themselves with no property that has its place among things created, but renounce all these on the ground of that intimate association with the Uncreate, to possess Whom, they are convinced, is the only wealth, the only gauge of consummate happiness.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="67"><p>  In face of this let those cease


their proud boastings who have acquired royal and imperial sway, some by bringing under their authority a single city or country or nation, some by having, over and above these, made themselves masters of all earth’s regions to its fullest bounds, all nations, Greek and barbarian alike, all rivers, and seas unlimited in number and extent.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="68"><p> For even had they,

besides controlling these, extended their empire, an idea which it were impious to utter, to the realm of the upper air, alone of all things made by the Creator to enjoy a freedom untouched by bondage—even then, they would be reckoned ordinary citizens when compared with great kings who received God as their portion; for the kingship of these as far surpasses

<pb n="249"/>

theirs as he that has gained possession is better than the possession, and he that has made than that which he has made.

<milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="17"/>
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="69"><p>Some, paying regard to outward want and outward

superfluity, and reckoning no one rich if found among those without money or possessions, have looked on the assertion that all things belong to the wise man as a paradox. But Moses considers wisdom an object of such admiration and emulation, that he thinks its worthy portion to be not merely the whole world, but the very Lord of all.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="70"><p> These are not, we must

remember, opinions held by men who halt between two opinions, but by men possessed by stedfast faith; for even now there are in the ranks of those who wear a semblance of piety, men who in a petty spirit find fault with<ref target="3-249-a"/>  the literal sense of the word, urging that it is irreligious and dangerous to speak of God as the portion of man.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="71"><p>  What I


would say to them is this: “The frame of mind in which you approached the consideration of the subject was not a genuine one, but spurious and illegitimate. You imagined that there is no difference between the way in which God is said to be the portion of the wise, and the way in which plantations of vines or olive trees or the like are said to be the possessions of their owners. You failed to notice that portrait-painting
is spoken of as a lot or portion for portrait-painters,
and generally any such pursuit for him who pursues it, not as an earthly possession to be owned, but as a heavenly prize to be striven for.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="72"><p> For things

such as these bring benefit to those who have them, without being under them as masters. Pray, then, you petty fault-finders, when you hear the Existent One spoken of as Portion, do not take it to mean a

<pb n="251"/>

possession similar to those which have been mentioned, but to mean One bringing vast benefits and the Cause of exceeding great good to those who regard His service as their fit employment.”

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="73"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="18"/> Having said, then, what was called for about

the first Planter and that which He planted, we will pass on next to the industry of those who have learnt from the former and copied the latter. We come at once to the record<ref target="3-251-a"/>  of Abraham the wise “planting a hide of land at the well of the oath, and invoking upon it the Name of the Lord as God eternal”
(Gen. xxi. 33). No particulars are given as to the kind of plants meant, but simply the size of the plot of ground.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="74"><p> Yet those whose habit it is to look closely

into such matters assure us that we have all the points of an estate laid down with extraordinary precision, the tree, the ground, and the fruit of the tree; the hide itself being the tree; not a tree like those which spring up from the earth, but one planted in the understanding of him that is beloved of God; the well of the oath, the plot of ground; and the change of the Name of the Lord into “God eternal,” the Fruit.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="75"><p> Each of these points requires further treatment

in the shape of such a reasoned account of them as may commend itself. Well, the hide, being 100 cubits long and as many broad, comes, by the rule of square measure, to 10,000 superficial cubits.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="76"><p> This is the highest completest term in the series

which increases from unity: that is to say, while 1 is the starting-point of numbers, a myriad or 10,000 is the end,<ref target="3-251-a"/>  if we adhere to the line of progress on which we set out.<ref target="3-251-b"/>  Accordingly that comparison is



<pb n="253"/>

not wide of the mark which some have made between 1 and the post from which runners start, and 10,000 and the post at which they finish, all the intervening numbers being like the competitors in the race; for beginning their course from 1 as from a starting-post
they come to a stop at 10,000 as the finish.
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="77"><p><milestone unit="para"/>Some have found symbols in these things and have

gone on with their help to proclaim God as the beginning and final goal of all things, a teaching on which religion can be built; this teaching, when planted in the soul, produces piety, a fruit most fair and full of nourishment.
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="78"><p><milestone unit="para"/>The well, entitled Oath, in which, as history says,

no water was found, is a place most appropriate to that which grew there. What we read is this: “The servants of Isaac came and brought word to him concerning the well which they had dug, saying ‘We found no water,’ and he called it ‘Oath’ ” (Gen. xxvi. 32 f.). Let us observe the force of these words.

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="79"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="19"/> Those who thoroughly


investigate the nature of existing things, and prosecute their inquires into each one of them in no indifferent spirit, act as those do who dig wells; for the investigators, like the well-diggers, are in search of hidden springs. And all have in common a desire to find water, but in the one case it is water naturally adapted to the nourishment of the body, in the other to the nourishment of the soul.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="80"><p> Now just as some

of those who open up wells often fail to find the water of which they are in search, so those, who make more than ordinary progress in various kinds of knowledge, and go deeper into them than most of us, are often powerless to reach the end they aim at. It is said that men of great learning accuse themselves of

<pb n="255"/>

terrible ignorance, for all that they have come to perceive is how far they fall short of the truth. There is a story<ref target="3-255-a"/>  that one of the men of the olden days, when people marvelled at his wisdom, said that he was rightly marvelled at; for that he was the only man who knew that he knew nothing.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="81"><p>  Choose, if you will, whatever science or art you may

be minded to choose, be it a small one or a greater one, and the man who is best and most approved in this art or science. Then notice carefully whether the professions of the science are made good by what its votary does. If you look you will find that the one fails of the other not by short but by long distances. For it is practically impossible to attain perfection in respect of any science or art whatever, seeing that it is being continually replenished, as a spring is, and ever welling up results of thought and study of many a kind.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="82"><p>  That is why the


name of “Oath” given to it was so perfectly suitable: for an oath represents that surest form of trustworthiness which carries with it the testimony of God. For as the man who swears calls God as a witness of the points in dispute, there is no point on which it is more possible to take a sure oath than upon the fact that no subject of knowledge whatever is found to have reached the goal of perfection in the person of him who is an expert in it.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="83"><p> The same

principle holds good for almost all the other faculties which we possess. For, just as in the well that we read of we are told that no water was found, so neither is sight found in eyes, nor hearing in ears, nor smelling in nostrils, nor, to say all at once, is sense-perception found in organs of sense; and apprehension in like manner is not found in mind

<pb n="257"/>

either.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="84"><p> For how would it ever happen that we

should see or hear or conceive amiss, if the power to apprehend each object had been inherently fixed in the several organs, instead of the power to apprehend springing from the seed of certitude sown upon the organs by God?

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="85"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="20"/> Now that we have adequately dealt with the

further subject of the plot in which the tree blooms, let us work out as our last point that of the fruit. What its fruit is, then, Moses himself shall inform us: for ’tis said “he called upon it the Name of the Lord, as God eternal” (Gen. xxi.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="86"><p> 33). The titles,

then, just mentioned exhibit the powers of Him that IS; the title “Lord” the power in virtue of which He rules, that of “God” the power in virtue of which He bestows benefits. This is why the name “God”
is employed throughout all the record of Creation given by Moses, that most holy man. For it was fitting that the Creator should be spoken of by a title coming to Him through that power in virtue of which,<ref target="3-257-a"/>  when bringing the world into being, He set and ordered it.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="87"><p> In so far as He is Ruler, He has

both powers, both to bestow benefits and to inflict evil, changing His dealing as the recompense due to the doer<ref target="3-257-b"/>  of every deed demands: but in so far as He is Benefactor, He wills only the one, to bestow benefits.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="88"><p> Very great good would come to the soul

from ceasing to be of two minds in face of the King’s readiness to put forth His might in either direction, and if it would resolutely break down the fear that hangs over it owing to the dread force of His sovereignty, and kindle the flame of that most sure hope of winning and enjoying good things, which is afforded by the fact that to be bountiful is His choice and

<pb n="259"/>

delight.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="89"><p> The title “God Eternal” is equivalent to


“He that is, not sometimes gracious and sometimes not so, but continuously and always; He that without intermission bestows benefits; He that causes His gifts to follow each other in ceaseless flow; He who makes His boons come round in unbroken cycle, knitting them together by unifying forces; He who lets no opportunity of doing good go by; He who is Lord,<ref target="3-259-a"/>  and so is able to hurt also.”

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="90"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="21"/> This is what Jacob, the trainer of self, claimed

as the fulfilment of those vows of most sacred import. He said, you remember, “And the Lord shall be to me for God” (Gen. xxviii. 21), as much as to say, He shall no longer exhibit towards me the masterfulness that characterizes the rule of an autocrat, but the readiness to bless that marks the power that is in every way kindly, and bent on the welfare of men. He shall do away with the fear we feel before
Him as Master, and implant in the soul the loyalty
and affection that goes out to Him as Benefactor.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="91"><p>  What soul, in fact, would imagine that

the Master and Sovereign of the Universe, without undergoing any change in His own nature, but remaining as He is, is kind continuously and bountiful incessantly, supreme Author of real good things coming without stint in ceaseless flow to happy souls?</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="92"><p> It is a strong bulwark of cheerfulness of

spirit and freedom from danger to have reposed our confidence in a King who is not urged by the greatness of His dominion to inflict injuries on His subjects, but whose love for man makes it His delight to supply what is lacking to each one.

<pb n="261"/>

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="93"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="22"/> We may take it, then, that the points which

we undertook to prove have now been demonstrated. That God be presupposed as Beginning and End of all things has been shewn to be the plant: as a corollary to this, that perfection is found in no part of creation, though by special grace<ref target="3-261-a"/>  of the First Cause it is ever and anon displayed upon its face, has been shewn to be the plot of ground; while the perpetuity and unceasing downpour of the gifts of God’s grace has been shewn to be the fruit.
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="94"><p><milestone unit="para"/>Of such sort, then, is husbandry as exhibited by

the sage also, treading in the steps of the first and greatest Planter.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="95"><p> But the intention of the inspired Word is that we too who are not yet perfected, but are still classified as in the preliminary and undeveloped stages of what are called natural duties,<ref target="3-261-a"/>  should make husbandry our serious business: for It says: “When ye shall have entered into the land,

which the Lord your God giveth you, and shall have planted any tree for food, ye shall cleanse away its uncleanness: for three years its fruit shall remain not cleansed away, it shall not be eaten: but in the fourth year all its fruit shall be holy for a thank-offering
to the Lord<ref target="3-261-b"/> : but in the fifth year ye shall eat the fruit; its crop<ref target="3-261-a"/>  shall be added to your store. I am the Lord, your God” (Lev. xix, 23–25).  Accordingly it is impossible to grow<milestone unit="section" n="96"/>

fruit-trees before migrating into the country given by God; for the words are, “When ye shall have entered into the land, ye shall plant every tree yielding food,” so that while staying outside we shall be unable to cultivate such trees. And this is what


<pb n="263"/>

we might expect;</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="97"><p> for, so long as the mind has not

come near and entered the way of wisdom, but turns in another direction and wanders away far off, its attention is given to trees of wild growth, which are either barren and yield nothing, or, though they are productive, bear no edible fruit.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="98"><p> But when the mind

has stepped on to the way of good sense, and in the company of all its teachings comes into and runs along that way, it will begin instead of those wild trees to cultivate trees of the orchard bearing orchard fruits, instead of passions freedom from them, knowledge in place of ignorance, good things in the place of evil things.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="99"><p> Since, then, the pupil just


beginning his course is a long way from the end, we can quite understand why he is directed after planting to remove the uncleanness of that which he has planted. Let us get a good view of what it is to do this.

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="100"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="23"/> Natural duties which are

indifferent<ref target="3-263-a"/>  seem to me to correspond to garden or orchard trees: for in each case most wholesome fruits are borne, for bodies in one case, for souls in the other. But many harmful shoots that spring together with the trees of the preliminary stage and many harmful growths that come on them have to be cut away, to save the better parts from being injured.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="101"><p> Might

we not speak of the returning of a sum entrusted to us as a tree grown in the soul’s orchard? Yet this tree at all events requires cleansing and more than usual attention. What is the cleansing in this case? When you have received something in trust from a man when he was sober, you should not return it to him when he is drunk, or when playing fast and loose with his money, or when mad, for the recipient will not be in a fit condition to derive any real benefit

<pb n="265"/>

from recovering it. And do not return it to debtors or slaves,<ref target="3-265-a"/>  when the creditors and masters are lying in wait for them. To do so is betrayal, not payment of a due. And do not be strict about a small sum entrusted to you, with a view to ensnaring people into trusting you with larger sums.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="102"><p> It is true that

fishermen drop small baits with a view to hooking the bigger fish, and are not seriously to blame. They can plead that they are providing for a good market, and to secure people an abundant supply for the table every day.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="103"><p> Then let no one parade the

payment of a trifling sum entrusted to him by way of a bait to get a larger deposit. To do so is to hold out in one’s hands an insignificant amount belonging to one person, while in intention one is appropriating untold sums belonging to all men. If, then, you treat the deposit as a tree and remove its impurities, to wit payments entailing injurious treatment to the recipient, ill-timed payments, payments that are really ensnaring tricks, and everything of this kind, you will make fit for your orchard what was turning wild.

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="104"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="24"/> In the tree of friendship there are outgrowths,

such as I shall describe, to be pruned and cut off for the sake of preserving the better part. Such outgrowths are practices of courtesans for taking in their lovers, ways parasites<ref target="3-265-b"/>  have of deceiving their dupes.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="105"><p> You may see women, who earn money by

the prostitution of their bodily charms, clinging to those enamoured of them as though they intensely loved them. It is not these that they love; they love themselves and are greedy for their daily takings. You may note flatterers cherishing often enough hatred that words cannot express for those upon

<pb n="267"/>

whom they fawn, in love with rich dishes and overeating, and induced by nothing else than these to court those who glut their measureless greed.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="106"><p> The

tree of genuine friendship will shake off and be quit of these things, and will bear fruit most beneficial to those who shall eat of it, namely honesty. For real goodwill is a desire that good<ref target="3-267-a"/>  should befall your neighbour for his own sake, whereas it is to further objects of their own that harlots and toadies take such pains to offer the things that will please, the former in their designs upon their lovers, the latter upon their patrons. So we must treat everything that smacks of sham and quackery as we treat hurtful ongrowths, and cut it away from the tree of friendship.

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="107"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="25"/> Again, sacred ministrations and the holy

service of sacrifices is a plant most fair, but it has a parasitic growth that is evil, namely superstition, and it is well to apply the knife to this before its green leaves appear. For some have imagined that it is piety to slaughter oxen, and allot to the altars portions of what they have got by stealing, or by repudiating debts, or by defrauding creditors,<ref target="3-267-b"/>  or by seizing property and cattle-lifting, thinking, in their gross defilement, that impunity for their offences is a thing that can be bought.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="108"><p> “Nay, nay,” I would

say to them, “no bribes, O foolish ones, can reach God’s tribunal.” He turns His face away from those who approach with guilty intent, even though they lead to His altar a hundred bullocks every day, and accepts the guiltless, although they sacrifice nothing at all. God delights in altars beset by a choir of Virtues, albeit no fire burn on them. He takes no delight in blazing altar fires fed by the unhallowed sacrifices of men to whose hearts sacrifice is unknown.

<pb n="269"/>

Nay, these sacrifices do but put Him in remembrance of the ignorance and offences of the several offerers; for Moses, as we know, speaks of sacrifice “bringing sin to remembrance” (Num. v.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="109"><p> 15). All such defilements

entail great loss. We must clear the way and cut them off in obedience to the oracle, in which a command is given to clear away the uncleanness of the fruit-trees that have been planted.

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="110"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="26"/> But, while we, even under teachers, fail to

make progress and become apt pupils, some, taking advantage of a nature which is its own teacher, have released the good in them from the hurtful growths which had fastened upon it. It was so with the trainer of self, whose name was Jacob, for he “peeled rods, stripping off the green bark, and causing them to shew white where they were peeled” (Gen. xxx. 37). His aim<ref target="3-269-a"/>  was to do away entirely with the variety and changeableness of hue, which is associated with the misty darkness and gloom of the undeveloped stages; and to bring into full view the whiteness, which is due to no artificial variegation, but is akin to Nature, to which it owes its birth. It is in accordance with this that in the law laid down regarding leprosy it is enjoined that the leper is clean whose body is no longer particoloured, shewing a variety of hues, but has turned white all over from head to foot (Lev. xiii. 12 f.). The aim of this ordinance is that, by way of leaving behind us bodily concerns,<ref target="3-269-a"/>  we may abandon the condition of mind which is changeful and vacillating, ready to put its hand to any project and to face both ways, and may take the plain hue of truth with its freedom from changefulness and indecision.
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="112"><p><milestone unit="para"/>The statement that the trees undergo a cleansing

is quite reasonable and accords with facts; the

statement that the fruit does so is by no means made good by what we see before our eyes; for no gardener cleanses figs or grapes or any fruit at all.

<milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="27"/> And yet it says, “The fruit shall remain uncleansed for three years; it shall not be eaten,”
as though it were the custom to cleanse it regularly as a matter of course. Let me say, then, that this again is one of the points to be interpreted allegorically,
the literal interpretation being quite out of keeping with facts. The sentence can be taken in two ways. Read in one way, it means something of this kind, “Its fruit shall be for three years”; then, as an independent sentence, “it shall not be eaten uncleansed.” Read in another way, “Its fruit shall be uncleansed for three years,” and then the words
“it shall not be eaten.”</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="114"><p> Led by the sense yielded

by the former punctuation, we arrive at this result. We take the three years to represent time in its natural threefold division into past, present, and future. The fruit of instruction—so we understand the words—shall be, subsist, remain free from interference, through all the divisions of time. This is equivalent to saying that throughout eternity it is exempt from corruption; for the nature of good is incorruptible. “But uncleansed fruit shall not be eaten.” This is due to the fact that right teaching, having submitted to a cleansing which makes it wholesome, nourishes the soul and makes the mind grow; while teaching of a contrary sort is devoid of nourishment, and lets loose upon the soul corruption and disease. An illustration will help us to see the senses which the other arrangement of the words may convey.</p></div>

the fruit of instruction as being not only “holy”

But it is not possible genuinely to express our gratitude to God by means of buildings and oblations and sacrifices, as is the custom of most people, for even the whole world were not a temple adequate to yield the honour due to Him.

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="129"><p> The story runs

that the Author of the universe on hearing this commended what had been said, and that it was not long before there appeared the new birth, the family of the Muses<ref target="3-279-a"/>  and hymnody, sprung from the womb of one of His powers, even virgin Memory, whose name most people slightly change and call her

This accords with nature’s incontrovertible law, that the place of creation is in all things lower than that

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="133"><p>  Again, the reason why he


ascribes to us the fruit of the fifth year and number is that 5 is the number proper to sense-perception, and that, if we are to face facts, we must own that it is sense-perception that supplies food to our mind.

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="134"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="33"/> A very clear illustration of what has been

said is found in the sons of Leah, who is Virtue; not indeed in all of them, but in the fourth and fifth. For, after recording the birth of the fourth, Moses says that “she ceased from bearing” (Gen. xxx. 35), and his name is “Judah,” which signifies “confession
of praise to the Lord.” The fifth she calls “Issachar,” a name which interpreted means “reward.” And the soul, upon giving birth to this character, at once gave utterance to her experience; for it says, “She called his name Issachar, which is ‘reward’ ” (Gen. xxx.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="135"><p> 18).  It follows that Judah, the



<pb n="283"/>

mind that blesses God, and is ceaselessly engaged in conning hymns of thanksgiving to Him, was himself the fruit that is really “holy and for praise to God,”
fruit borne not by earth’s trees but by those of a rational and virtuous nature. Accordingly the nature which gave birth to him is said to have “ceased from bearing,” because she had no longer any way to turn, having reached the utmost bound of perfectness;
for of all successful accomplishments<ref target="3-283-a"/>  ever brought to the birth the best and most perfect is the hymn of praise to the Father of the universe.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="136"><p>  The fifth son is identical with the using

in the fifth year of the trees that had been planted; for, on the one hand, the husbandman does receive a sort of pay or reward from the trees in the fifth year, and, on the other, the offspring of the soul was called Issachar, “pay” or “reward.” He was very naturally so called, having been born next after Judah the thanksgiver; for the thanksgiver finds in thanksgiving itself an all-sufficient reward.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="137"><p>  Now, whereas fruits borne by trees are called products

of the persons who own them, the fruit of instruction and good sense is not like these spoken of as being a man’s, but as belonging, as Moses says, to no other than the Ruler of all. For after the words,
“His products,<ref target="3-283-b"/> ” he adds, “I am the Lord your God,”

attention to the question; which is propounded
in the form “Will the wise man get drunk?” Now, there are two ways of getting drunk<ref target="3-285-b"/> ; one is equivalent to drinking heavily, the other to being silly in your cups.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="143"><p><ref target="3-285-c"/>  Among those who have tackled the

problem some have maintained that the wise man will neither take strong drink in excess nor become

silly and maudlin; the latter being a sin, and the former productive of sin, and both alike alien to him whose standard of conduct is the highest.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="144"><p> Others, while regarding a condition of silliness as

foreign to a man of moral excellence, have pronounced heavy drinking to befit him, seeing that the good sense which resides in him is capable of holding its own against everything that attempts to injure him, and of baffling their efforts to change the constitution of his soul. They hold that good sense is an armour which has power to quench passions, whether fanned by the stinging blasts of inflaming love, or kindled by the heat of much wine; and that in virtue of his good sense he will come off victorious. They point out that, when people sink in a deep river or in the sea, those who cannot swim are drowned, while those who know how to swim escape at once; and that a quantity of strong drink is like a torrent washing over the soul; in one case, as it sinks, plunging it into the lowest depth of ignorance, in another case, as it is buoyed up and kept afloat by salutary instruction, altogether powerless to hurt it.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="145"><p>  The others,<ref target="3-287-a"/> 

failing, as I think, to recognize the completeness of the wise man’s superiority to every passion, have brought him down to earth from heaven whose skies he haunts, treating him as fowlers treat the birds they catch, and being bent on bringing him into as evil a plight, and not setting him on virtue’s lofty summit, have declared that after taking an immoderate quantity of wine he will certainly lose self-control and commit sin, and not only, like vanquished athletes, let his hands fall from sheer weakness, but let his neck and head drop and his knees give way, and, collapsing in

to our inquiry. It is time for us to state in full the argument bearing upon it. That argument obviously admits of two contentions, one establishing the thesis that the wise man will get drunk, the other maintaining the contrary, that he will not get drunk.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="150"><p> It will be convenient to take first the

proofs by which the former thesis is supported. We will begin by remarking that some things are

<pb n="291"/>

homonymous and others synonymous. Everyone will allow that homonymy and synonymy are opposites, homonymy meaning one name applied to many objects, synonymy many names applied to one object.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="151"><p>  The word “dog” is certainly


homonymous, several dissimilar objects being included under it,<ref target="3-291-a"/>  all of which it is used to signify. The barking animal on the land is a “dog”; so is the monster found in the sea; and the star in the heavens which the poets call the fruit star, because just when the summer fruit has reached its prime this star rises to bring it to perfection and to ripen it. The name “dog” is applied moreover to the man whose philosophy takes its colour from the Cynic school, Aristippus, Diogenes, and ever so many others who found it congenial to conform themselves to their principles.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="152"><p>  There are other names which are different though

one thing is meant by them, as “arrow,” “shaft,”
“dart”; for the thing discharged at the mark from the string of the bow is called by all these names. Again, the instrument which does as well as sails for propelling a vessel is called an “oar,” “scull,” “rowing-sweep.”
For when, owing to a calm or head wind, a vessel cannot make use of sails, the men, whose business it is, take their seats at the oars, and stretching out from each side wing-like blades, force the vessel to be borne along as though it were flying. The vessel, lifted high out of the water, not so much cutting the waves as coursing over them, makes a quick run, and is soon safely moored in harbour.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="153"><p>  Once more “staff,” “walking-stick,”

“rod” are different names by which we call one object, with which we can beat someone, on which

<pb n="293"/>

we can firmly support ourselves, on which we can lean, and with which we can do several other things. I have given these examples, not just because my tongue runs on, but that we may get a clearer idea of the subject which we are investigating.

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="154"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="38"/> The ancients called strong

drink “wine” and an “intoxicant” indifferently: as we see from the frequency with which this last word occurs in poetry. If, then, “wine” and “intoxicant”
are used as synonyms of one object, their derivatives “to be filled with wine” and “to be intoxicated” will differ only in word;</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="155"><p> for either

term denotes taking more wine than usual, a thing which several motives<ref target="3-293-a"/>  might induce a really excellent man to do. But if such an one will get filled with wine, he will get drunk, and be in no worse plight for being drunk, but in precisely the same state as he was brought to by being filled with wine.
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="156"><p><milestone unit="para"/>One proof of the wise man’s getting drunk has

been mentioned; there is a second to the following effect. Broadly speaking, the men of the present day, apart from a small fraction of them, do not resemble those of former times in their aims and enthusiasms, but both in language and in action exhibit tendencies wholly out of harmony with theirs.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="157"><p> Language that was once healthy and robust they

have turned into a jargon hopelessly depraved. For a style sound and full of vitality as an athlete’s frame they have substituted a sickly form of speech. A full and massive type, possessed, as someone has said, of a solidity due to its firmness of fibre, they debase into a bloated mis-growth of disease, to which they give a seeming loftiness and grandeur by

<pb n="295"/>

empty puffing and blowing, which, in default of any confining power, bursts when distention has reached its limit.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="158"><p> Actions, meriting praise and calling out

enthusiasm, and, if the expression may be permitted, masculine, they have rendered effeminate, and in performing them made them base instead of noble. The result is that whether on the side of action or of speech, there are very few indeed who take delight in the objects that kindled the ardour of the men of old.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="159"><p>  Consequently in their


times poets and chroniclers flourished and all who engaged in literary work of other kinds, and they did not at once charm and enervate men’s ears by the rhythm of their language, but they revived any faculty of the mind that had broken down and lost its tone, and every true note of it they kept in tune with the instruments of nature and of virtue. But in our days it is chefs and confectioners that flourish, and experts in making dyes and concocting unguents. These are ever aiming at sacking the citadel of Mind, by bringing to bear upon the senses some novelty in shade of colour or shape of dress or perfume or savoury dish.

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="160"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="39"/> What has been my object in recalling

these things? My object has been to make it clear that the modern way of taking strong drink is not the same as the ancient way. For nowadays men go on till body and soul are unstrung, drinking huge draughts without stopping, open-mouthed for more, and ordering the servants to replenish the cups they have just filled and shewing arrogance if they delay, because all such delay cools what they are pleased to call the “heat” of the carousal. They give an exhibition to their fellow-guests of that counterfeit

<pb n="297"/>

parody of the athletic games, namely the tipsy contest. In this they practise on one another magnificent passes, gnawing off ears and noses and tops of fingers and any parts of the body that come handy.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="161"><p>  These are, apparently, the contests indulged

in by the gladness of these later times, which flourishes to-day and is just reaching its full growth; but far other were those of the more lofty gladness of old. For our forefathers inaugurated every noble business with sacrifices duly offered, deeming that an auspicious result would by this means be ensured. However urgently the crisis might call for immediate action, they never failed to tarry to pray and offer sacrifices beforehand, deeming that what is rapid is not always superior to what is slow; for rapidity without forethought is hurtful, while slowness prompted by the prospect of a happy issue is beneficial.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="162"><p>  Knowing, then, that, like other things, the use and

enjoyment of wine needs great care, they took strong drink neither in great quantity nor at all times, but in such order and season as was befitting. For after having first prayed and presented sacrifices and implored the favour of the Deity, when they had cleansed their bodies by ablutions and their souls by streams of holy ordinances and instructions in the right way, radiant and gladsome they turned to relaxation and enjoyment, in many cases not after returning home, but remaining in the temples in which they had sacrificed in order that both the recollection of their sacrifices and their reverence for the place might lead them to celebrate a festivity in actual truth most holy, sinning neither in word nor deed.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="163"><p>  You must know that


it was from this, so it is said, that “getting drunk”

<pb n="299"/>

got its name, because it was the custom of the men of earlier times to indulge in wine
“after sacrificing.”<ref target="3-299-a"/>  Now with whom, I ask, would the mode of using strong drink just described be more in keeping than with wise men, with whose character the act which precedes the drunkenness, namely the act of sacrificing, is also in perfect accord?</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="164"><p> For we may venture to say that there is not a single

bad man who really performs a sacrificial act, even though he lead to the altar in unceasing procession ten thousand bullocks every day; for in his case the mind, the most essential victim, is a blemished thing, and no blemish may come into contact with an altar.
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="165"><p><milestone unit="para"/>Such is a second argument put forward to shew

that getting drunk is not a thing inconsistent with moral excellence.

<milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="40"/> There is a third, possessing etymological plausibility<ref target="3-299-b"/>  in a very high degree. For some hold that drunkenness is so termed, not only because it follows the performance of sacrifice, but because it is also the cause of a letting go or release of soul.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="166"><p> | It is to


give vent to many sins that the reasoning faculty of fools is let go, but that of sensible men for the enjoyment of relaxation, cheerfulness, and good spirits; for the wise man becomes a more genial person after indulging in wine than when he is sober, and accordingly we should not be wrong in asserting on this ground as well as on those others that he will get drunk.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="167"><p>  We must remark


furthermore that the countenance of wisdom is not scowling and severe, contracted by deep thought and depression of spirit, but on the contrary cheerful and tranquil, full of joy and gladness, feelings which often prompt a man to be sportive and

<pb n="301"/>

jocular in a perfectly refined way. Such sportiveness
is in harmony with a dignified self-respect, a harmony like that of a lyre tuned to give forth a single melody by a blending of answering notes.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="168"><p>  Moses, at all events, holiest of men,

shews us that sport and merriment is the height of wisdom, not the sport which children of all sorts indulge in, paying no heed to good sense, but such as is seen in those who are now become grey-headed not only in respect of age but of thoughtfulness. Do you not observe that when he is speaking of the man who drew directly from the well of knowledge, listening to no other, learning through no other, resorting to no agency whatever, he does not say that he had a part in laughter, but that he was laughter itself?</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="169"><p> I am speaking of Isaac, whose name means

“laughter,” and whom it well befits to sport with “patient waiting,” who is called in Hebrew “Rebecca.”

<milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="41"/> For the sacred sporting of the soul is a sight not permissible to an ordinary citizen, but it is open to a king, with whom wisdom was for a very long time a guest, if indeed she did not make him her permanent abode. The name of this king is Abimelech. He looked out at the window, the mind’s eye wide-opened and admitting light, and saw Isaac sporting with Rebecca his wife (Gen. xxvi.</p></div>

seemly for a wise man rather than bright sportiveness and making merry in the company of one who waits patiently for all that is beautiful? Hence it is evident that he will get drunk also, seeing that drunkenness benefits the character, saving it from overstrain and undue intensity.</p></div>

whether good or the reverse, just as many other things do. Money, it has been said, is the cause of good things to a good man, of evil things to a bad man. Fame again makes the fool’s badness more conspicuous, while it causes a brighter glory to rest upon the virtue of the righteous man. On this principle, therefore, a lavish use of strong drink places the man who has given the rein to his passions more completely at their mercy, while it makes him who has cherished right feelings<ref target="3-303-a"/>  more kindly and well disposed.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="172"><p>  Again, all


know that when one of two opposite predicates is applicable to two or more sets of people, it cannot but be that the other is applicable also. For instance, black and white are opposites. If white is predicable of bad and good, black too will of course be equally so of both, not only of one of the two sets. So too soberness and drunkenness are opposites, and both bad and good men, so our forefathers said, partake of soberness. It follows that drunkenness also is predicable of both sorts. Accordingly the man of moral worth will get drunk as well as other people without losing any of his virtue.

regarding those who are in the habit of losing their heads; thus giving the go-by altogether to intoxication as an aspect of the subject. Thus we find in these men too the most explicit acknowledgement that drunkenness was suffering from the effects of wine. But there would be nothing amiss in a wise man quaffing wine freely on occasion: we shall not be wrong, then, in saying that he will get drunk.

counter the arguments just mentioned by saying that according to it the wise man will never be melancholy, never fall asleep, in a word, never die. But he whom nothing of this sort befalls would be an inanimate thing or a Divine Being, certainly not a man. For reproducing the conduct of the argument, he will apply it in this way to the case of the melancholy or sleeping or dying man: No one would act reasonably in entrusting a secret to one in such case, but would act reasonably in doing so to a wise man: therefore a wise man never falls into melancholy, or goes to sleep, or dies.
