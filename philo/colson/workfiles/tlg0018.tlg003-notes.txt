<note n="2.8.1">Cohn excludes καὶ ἔταξε on the grounds that though
they appear in the text of the LXX., it is assumed in § 11 that the Cherubim and not Adam are placed opposite the Garden.</note>



<note n="2.9.a">See General Introduction, pp. xvi, xvii.</note>




<note n="2.11.a">Philo draws a distinction between μετάρσιος (perhaps deriving it from ἀήρ) and μετέωρος.</note>


<note n="2.11.b">Or “which astronomy, the noblest branch of nature-study, claims as its own.”</note>


<note n="2.11.c">Or “in her single self.”</note>


<note n="2.11.d">See App. p. 481.</note>




<note n="2.12.1">So MSS., but perhaps read according to a citation of the
passage in Clem. Alex. <hi rend="italic">Strom.</hi> v. 1. 8 ἐξειλεγμένος δὲ ὁ τοῦ
σπουδαίου, i.e. “the chosen mind is that of the good man”;
<hi rend="italic">cf. De Gig.</hi> 64.</note>


<note n="2.12.2">Perhaps read ἀπομαθόντων. For other suggestions see
App. pp. 481, 482. <hi rend="italic">Cf. L.A.</hi> iii. 236.</note>



<note n="2.13.a">An allusion to Gen. xxvi. 8 where Isaac “sported” with
Rebecca. See also App. p. 482.</note>


<note n="2.13.b">See note on § 62.</note>




<note n="2.14.1">Perhaps with Mangey ὅποτε καὶ παῖδα σοφιστὴν.</note>




<note n="2.17.a">See App. p. 482.</note>




<note n="2.19.a">Literally “smouldering.”</note>




<note n="2.21.a">Or “with fitness”; there is a play on the double sense
of the word.</note>


<note n="2.21.b">Philo takes these terms, and indeed the whole passage,
from Plato, <hi rend="italic">Timaeus</hi> 36, on which see Archer-Hind’s notes
as also on <hi rend="italic">ib.</hi> 38 D.</note>




<note n="2.22.1">MSS. μεσοδρόμοις or μὴ μεσοδρόμους.</note>



<note n="2.23.a">i.e. of the heaven. Thus in <hi rend="italic">De Decalogo</hi> 56, 57, Philo
speaks of the two hemispheres, one above the earth and one
below it. “For as the heaven is ceaselessly revolving, the
two hemispheres daily take their position in turn one above the earth and the other below it, as it seems, though in reality there is no ‘up’ or ‘down’ in the spherical heaven.”

<note n="2.26.1">μέτρον ὄντα conj. Trs.; cf. μετρεῖν, 31: MSS. μέτα: Cohn
μέσον.</note>



<note n="2.27.a">See App. p. 483.</note>




<note n="2.29.a">Or “applaud as . . .”</note>


<note n="2.29.b">Or “heedlessness.” In the LXX. the ass asks Balaam μὴ ύπεροράσει ὑπεριδοῦσα ἐποίησά σοι οὕτως;</note>




<note n="2.30.1">MSS μηδὲν.</note>


<note n="2.30.2">So Cohn from δίοπτος of F. The other MSS have
πηδαλιοῦχος.</note>


<note n="2.30.3">MSS ἐννοίας.</note>



<note n="2.31.a">Or “put an end to the war . . . and proclaim peace.”</note>




<note n="2.32.1">MSS. ἔστησεν.</note>



<note n="2.33.a">That Philo perversely takes the subject of εἶπεν to be Adam and that of προσέθηκε to be God appears from § 124 and <hi rend="italic">De Sac</hi>. 10.</note>


<note n="2.33.b">Literally “it” or “he” will show. If “it,” the subject is either “the fact that women symbolize sense,” or perhaps
“knowledge”: if “he,” the legislator.</note>


<note n="2.33.c">See App. p. 483.</note>




<note n="2.34.1">MSS. ἐπιγόνην.</note>



<note n="2.35.a">See App. p. 483.</note>


<note n="2.35.b">Or “prays.”</note>




<note n="2.37.a">See App. p. 483.</note>




<note n="2.38.1">So Wendland: MSS. τῶν (which Cohn retains), or τὸν. The former, which makes the ideas belong to the particulars, seems hardly intelligible.</note>



<note n="2.39.a">See App. p. 483.</note>




<note n="2.41.a">See App. pp. 483, 484.</note>




<note n="2.42.1">MSS. ἐνέργειαι.</note>


<note n="2.42.2">Bracketed by Cohn as otiose.</note>




<note n="2.44.1">Cohn ἀθροῦν (part. of ἀθρέω), “a discerning instrument.” This seems a very strange expression, though it is true that “all-collecting” is an unususal sense for ἀθρόος. Perhaps read with Markland ἀρκοῦν, or possibly σώματος οὐκ ἐφήπτετο ἀθρόως, &lt;οὐκ&gt; ἔχων. <hi rend="italic">Cf.</hi> below, 62.</note>



<note n="2.45.a">Literally “things that dwell together and belong to a herd.”</note>


<note n="2.45.b">Or “for he to whom they were to be made known lacked sense.”</note>




<note n="2.47.a">In Stoic terminology ἕξις is something less permanent than διάθεσις. Thus the mastery of the arts is a ἕξις (and therefore μέση, see 9), while virtue is a διάθεσις.</note>


<note n="2.47.b">Or “he thought.”</note>




<note n="2.49.a">The construction is confused. Perhaps (<hi rend="italic">a</hi>) transfer the
μὴ to before παρορᾶν (as in the translation) or (<hi rend="italic">b</hi>) omit it.
In this case the sense will be “let him tell us how it is that (as he knows is the case) he will still be capable of sense-error.”</note>




<note n="2.50.1">MSS μηκίστους.</note>


<note n="2.50.2">Cohn prints ἐοικότες &lt;λογισμοὶ&gt; ἑλκυσμοὺς καὶ. The MSS.
vary between ἑλκυσμοὶ and ἑλκυσμοὺς καὶ. See App. p. 484.</note>



<note n="2.51.a">See App. p. 484.</note>




<note n="2.52.1">MSS. οὐκέτ &lt;οὐκ ἔτ᾿&gt; εἰμὶ or οὐκ ἐξελεύσομαι. Cohn’s conjecture
agrees with the citation of the text in <hi rend="italic">Quis Rer. Div.
Her.</hi> 38. The MSS has οὐκ ἀποτρέχω, in which form Philo
quotes it, <hi rend="italic">L.A.</hi> iii. 198.</note>



<note n="2.53.a">Or “boy.” Philo plays with the double sense of παῖς.</note>


<note n="2.53.b"><hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> Pharaoh.</note>





<note n="2.57.a">See App. p. 484.</note>




<note n="2.58.1">Cohn has κατανοήσωμεν τό, ὅλα μου, φησίν, ἐστίν. There
is much confusion in the MSS. here. The insertion of τό
makes κατανοήσωμεν have two objects and though the article
prefacing a quotation is common enough it hardly suits a
quotation where φησίν is inserted in the middle.</note>



<note n="2.59.a">See App. pp. 484, 485.</note>







<note n="2.67.a">Literally “the boundaries (of the ἀγορά) marked out by the sprinkling of the lustral water.”</note>





<note n="2.70.1">Cohn suggests γραμματικῇ . . . γεωμετρίᾳ . . . ῥητορικῇ.</note>



<note n="2.71.a">Or, taking ἤρτηται ἐκ τῆς μελέτης together, “on the study
. . . depend.” But the form of the sentence and the fuller
sense given to ἤρτηται suggest the way adopted in the transla- tion. Philo often uses ἀρτᾶσθαι with the simple genitive, <hi rend="italic">e.g</hi>.
τῶν ποιοτήτων ἠρτημένος 67.</note>


<note n="2.71.b">See App. p. 485.</note>


<note n="2.71.c">Or “procures us the means of expressing.”</note>




<note n="2.73.a">An allusion to Gen. xviii. 5 ff.</note>




<note n="2.75.a">See App. p. 485.</note>


<note n="2.75.b">Or “all our surroundings.”</note>


<note n="2.75.c">Literally, “as a thing to be used” or “a loan.”</note>
