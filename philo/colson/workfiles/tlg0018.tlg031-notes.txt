<note n="10.93.a">meaning I can give to the statement is that the visit of Agrippa had created an intimacy which made him a natural channel in the subsequent matters for approaching Gaius. Unless indeed some words are lost. See next note.</note>



<note n="10.93.a">This document of course was quite different from the
complimentary address mentioned in <hi rend="italic">Flaccus</hi> 103 as sent in
duplicate through Agrippa. The statement made here
seems to me to raise considerable difficulty. The natural
meaning is that it was handed to Agrippa at his visit to
Alexandria in the spring of 38. That the Jews might have
given him a petition setting forth their rights, i.e. their claims
to citizenship, is possible enough, and as circumstances had
not changed this, this petition might have been adequate
later. But it also is said to have set forth their sufferings,
i.e. the persecutions and the desecration of the synagogues,
and these could not have been described in a document
handed to Agrippa during this visit, for it is impossible to
suppose that he remained at Alexandria through the pogrom
which culminated at the end of August. The only intelligible</note>


<note n="10.93.b">Reiter gives no reason for supplying a lacuna here beyond the words “lacunam statuit Cohn.” But Cohn’s article in <hi rend="italic">Philologus</hi> says nothing bearing on it, though he observes that as the ambassadors are suddenly introduced in ch. xxvii., some account of the reasons for the embassy may have been originally given there. I expect that his idea of a lacuna at this point in ch. xxvhi. is a later modification. I see no reasons for supposing lacunas on any such grounds. See Introd. pp. xxii. But it is true that a few words to the effect that Agrippa’s visit had led to intimacy with him might have cleared up the difficulty mentioned in the preceding note.</note>

etc. In this case the παρανομίαι are the outrages we expected to happen in Alexandria. So substantially Mangey, though he reads ἀγωνιζόμενοι.</note>

The second alternative was to throw up the whole thing and go home. This is rejected as unworthy (§ 195). The third was to wait on quietly in Italy trusting in God and hoping that the crisis would pass (§ 196). This is probably what actually happened thanks to Agrippa’s intercession, after which the envoys were admitted and even if unsuccessful, at any rate, left unharmed. I see no reason to agree with Balsdon, page 136, that this “laboured defence shows that they were criticised for neglecting to make any gesture at this point.”</note>



<note n="10.99.a">The six sections which follow become intelligible if we
recognize that ἰδίου in § 193 refers to the particular interests
of the Alexandrain Jews, especially their claims to citizenship,
as opposed to the interests of the nation as a whole, and
not to the personal safety of the ambassadors. Philo and his
colleagues had three courses of action before them. First they
might proceed with their suit, perhaps by sending the document
mentioned in § 178 if that had not been sent already.
This was impracticable as far as the synagogue question was
concerned and might probably cost them their lives (§ 191).

It was natural that Gaius should tell Petronius to get a statue made and he may be credited with enough sense to see that it had better not be made in Judaea itself.

its superfluity after πέμπειν.</note>


<note n="10.146.2">The supposed lacuna suggested by Mangey is supported
by Cohn and Reiter. It certainly looks as if some words had
fallen out anticipating what is said of Julia Augusta (Livia)
in § 319, as ἐλθών anticipates the account of Agrippa in §§ 294–297, and the words about Augustus anticipate §§ 311–318. But I should not expect more than something like δι᾿ ὧν ἐδωρήσατο, since ἐτίμησε has all three persons for its subject. Mangey however thought that something more was required on the grounds that § 292 has no logical connexion with § 291. But if we regard that section as parenthetical there is a sufficient logical connexion between §§ 290 and 292, and it is quite in Philo’s manner to have causal clauses which connect with something which has not immediately preceded. See Introd. pp. xxi–xxiii.</note>

be followed by a dative, nor any difficulty in ἐπὶ συστάσει.

<note n="10.161.a">By παιδείας Philo clearly refers to the instruction received from her ὑφηγητής Augustus, and it is inconsistent with this to say that it was gained by nature and practice. The same applies if reading with Reiter we translate “through instruction she surpassed (her sex) in nature and practice.” The translation above seems to me to give the required sense. Livia had the advantage of Augustus’s instruction but like everybody else she could not use it properly without the other two. But I cannot find examples of περιγίγνομαι in this sense and I should like to read παραγεγενημένης=“supporting” or “supplementing.”</note>



<note n="10.161.a">The exact meaning, as well as the reading, see note 1, is
uncertain. The one thing certain is that we have an allusion
to the Educational Trinity, Nature, Instruction and Practice,
which occurs so frequently in Philo, particularly in its spiritual
application. See particularly Introd. to vol. vi. pp. x f. and
vol. viii. p. 453. Mangey’s translation “ex eruditione pura
quam natura et studio comparaverat,” is, I think, impossible.</note>

<note n="10.169.a">More literally, “admirably situated for commanding or

infers that Philo is compelled to admit that Gaius gave a
hearing to the Jewish arguments, is, I think, certainly wrong.
The question mark appended both by Mangey and Reiter is
necessitated by ὅς, which cannot bear the sense which Balsdon
gives it.</note>

<note n="10.187.a">“Counter-story” or “reversal.” Presumably this gave an account of Gaius’s death and probably also the change of policy adopted by Claudius, as shown in the two edicts recorded by Josephus, <hi rend="italic">Ant.</hi> xix. 5. If, that is, it was ever written, for it is curious that Eusebius in his brief notice of the <hi rend="italic">Legatio,</hi> see Introd. pp. xvii, shows no knowledge of it.

The only sense in which the story of these events would be a recantation would be that it would force the doubters of providence to recant. I think παλινοδία, said by Suidas to=ἐναντία ὁδός, would be a more natural word.</note>
