<note n="5.15.a">The allusion to Anaxagoras in § 10 perhaps suggests that
some definite persons or school is meant, possibly his predecessors

<note n="5.17.c">I can give no satisfactory explanation of “names.” See App. pp. 581 f.</note>




<note n="5.19.a">The meaning seems to be that while the three Aristotelian
ἀγαθά, viz. τὰ περὶ ψυχήν, τὰ περὶ σῶμα and τὰ ἐκτός may be
δόκιμα in a sense, for even the Stoics admitted “preferable
indifferents” among the two latter, only the first is acceptable
to the true Practiser. See <hi rend="italic">Quod Det.</hi> 7 and note, also
<hi rend="italic">De Gig.</hi> 38.</note>




<note n="5.20.1">I have bracketed καὶ as disturbing the symmetry of the

τυμπάνων καὶ κιθάρας. Each of the four terms receives in turn
its negative qualification.</note>

<note n="5.41.a">Or “eternity,” but there is not here that opposition
between time and eternity which we sometimes have in
Philo, <hi rend="italic">e.g. Quod Deus</hi> 32. Perhaps “the ages” is the best
English equivalent.</note>


<note n="5.41.b">The thought is not very clear. Perhaps “the sun
measures time by its presence and absence. Thus it is
always some day and therefore at each moment ‘to-day.’” It might be given more clearly by translating in a different order; “For the sun, though its course is sometimes above sometimes below the earth, and thus creates the distinction between daytime and night-time, which serves as a measure of the ages, is always the same sun.” Perhaps read παρ᾿ ὃ for παρ᾿ ὃν.

upon Cain, in order that no one should kill him.” But the
fuller discussion of the text in <hi rend="italic">Quod Det.</hi> 177 shows that
Philo, with little respect for grammar, takes it as in the
translation, viz. that the distinctive mark of the Cain-soul
is that it can never be killed.</note>

<note n="5.51.a">The point of the sentence is not quite clear. Perhaps
the meaning is that by placing the two clearly superior

ἑκούσια; <hi rend="italic">cf. De Agr.</hi> 177 ff.</note>


<note n="5.57.b">The connexion of thought seems to be as follows: the
blasphemer who ascribes ἑκούσια ἁμαρτήματα to God and not
only he but all the profane and irreverent must be avoided, while those who know better than to be guilty of this particular blasphemy and of profanity in general will find in God a refuge for their unintentional errors.</note>


<note n="5.57.c">The translation ignores αὐτά. Perhaps it is used like the frequent αὐτὸ μόνον for “just these,” in which case ἀναγκαῖα may be taken as “absolutely necessary.”</note>




<note n="5.58.1">Unless Philo uses the nominative for the demonstrative, αὐτό seems pointless: perhaps τοῦτο.</note>



<note n="5.59.a">So L. &amp; S. render the word; perhaps rather “all those of military age,” = Latin <hi rend="italic">pubes.</hi></note>


<note n="5.59.b">In the parallel pasage <hi rend="italic">De Ebr.</hi> 69 ff. the “neighbour” is the senses themselves.</note>

antithesis to προφορικός.</note>




<note n="5.61.a">Mangey and Wend. suspected τοῦ λέγοντος and suggested
ὄντος or ἡγεμόνος. But Philo sometimes thinks of the Logos
as in the literal sense the “word” which God speaks. It is
particularly natural here in connexion with creation, where
every creative act is preceded by “God said.” <hi rend="italic">Cf. De

<note n="5.65.b">Philo apparently takes “thee” to be the Logos; cf. § 76. See also note on § 95, though here the Logos is spoken to, not the word spoken.</note>




<note n="5.66.1">πόλεις perhaps (as Wendland) is needed. For the strange

<note n="5.66.2">MSS. ἐπικοινων(ι)αὶ δὲ προσεχεῖς: Mangey ἐστί· κοινωναὶ δὲ καὶ προσεχεῖς.</note>




<note n="5.69.a">Or “with,” “through,” as Philo understands the preposition.
The meaning of the original is that as contact
with a corpse entails defilement, the priests are only to touch
the bodies of their nearest of kin (Lev. xxi. 2), but the
High Priest not even these. Philo’s allegory understands
it to mean that with the ordinary man both father mind and
mother sense may cause defilement, but the Logos is of other
parentage.</note>


<note n="5.69.b">Or “the soul in the partial sense,” i.e. excluding the “ruling principle”; <hi rend="italic">cf. De Op</hi>. 117 τῆς ἡμετέρας ψυχῆς τὸ δίχα

<note n="5.71.a">So G.H.W. This translation assumes that προσβάλλειν is
used idiomatically, <hi rend="italic">sc.</hi> ὀσμήν. See examples in L. &amp; S., e.g.
κρέα ἰχθύων προσβάλλει, “the flesh smells like fish.” But the use of such a phrase here seems to me rather strange, and I should prefer to remove the comma, take ὧν as = τῶν ἃ and translate “of those which folly is wont to send in its way.” <hi rend="italic">Cf. Quod Det</hi>. 98. Or perhaps with Mangey read ᾧ and translate “which folly loves to approach.”</note>




<note n="5.72.1">Mangey and Cohn would omit ἄθεον as inappropriate here,

<note n="5.72.3">So MSS.: Wendland ἑκουσίοις following Ambrose, <hi rend="italic">De fuga saeculi</hi>
2. 13, who in a paraphrase of the passage has
“incipit anima peccatis patere voluntariis.” If this is
right, presumably the thought is that while the offences
when expelled were involuntary, if they return it will be as
voluntary sins. The transition would be less abrupt if καὶ was inserted after δίδοται, or we might read ἀκουσίοις &lt;καὶ ἑκουσίοις&gt;, cf. the end of § 115.</note>



<note n="5.73.a"><hi rend="italic">Cf. Quod Deus</hi> 89, <hi rend="italic">De Agr</hi>. 175 and note.</note>




<note n="5.74.1">The text as it stands is untranslatable: Mangey suggests
τὸ παράπαν for τόπον: I suggest ὀλίσθου, “any room
for lapse of purpose,” i.e. for any ἑκούσιον ἁμάρτημα.</note>


<note n="5.74.2">MSS. ἐξ ἀρχῆς.</note>



<note n="5.75.a">The interpretation of §§ 116-118 does not seem to be in keeping with what has gone before. Hitherto it was the “involuntary offenders” themselves who found a refuge in the Powers of which the Logos himself was the chief. Here the thought is that the <hi rend="italic">offences</hi> have been <hi rend="italic">banished</hi> and will not return so long as we retain the Logos. He has in fact passed from the sense of φεύγω = “to take refuge” to that of φεύγω = “be banished.”</note>

<note n="5.84.1">MSS. περὶ νοητὰ (-ῶ).</note>



<note n="5.85.a">These words of course really refer to the orders which
follow as to the gathering of the manna. Philo takes them
to refer to the preceding verse and thus identifies the manna
with the “saying” and therefore also with the Logos. So
also <hi rend="italic">Leg. All.</hi> iii. 173.</note>


<note n="5.85.b">See note on § 170.</note>




<note n="5.86.1">Wend. proposes to fill up the lacuna: μὴ ἀρκουμένους τῇ
νεωκόρων τάξει. Perhaps καίτοι ἤδη . . . ἔχοντας would
account better for the loss of the words in the MSS.</note>



<note n="5.87.a">Or “although” . . . still.” ὥσπερ . . . οὕτως seem here to be used in this adversative sense, as <hi rend="italic">ut</hi> and <hi rend="italic">ita</hi> often are in Latin, but I do not know of any parallel.</note>




<note n="5.89.a">Philo evidently interprets the two attacks as directed
(1) against the Epicureans, (2) against the Peripatetics. The
two schools however are not put on the same footing. The
Epicurean is an Egyptian, who is smiting the Hebrew Stoic; in the second case the wrongdoer whom Moses rebukes is a Hebrew as well as his opponent.</note>




<note n="5.90.1">Wend. suggests the insertion of δηλοῦσα before διὰ:
better, as Cohn, δοῦσα after ῥάβδου.</note>



<note n="5.91.a">See App. p. 585.</note>




<note n="5.92.1">A difficult phrase which Mangey regarded as spurious:
perhaps read μυρίων, “she becomes the seed-plot of thousands.”</note>



<note n="5.93.a">The allegory seems to get a little confused at this point. Properly the mind is the purchaser of the lady Virtue or Piety.</note>




<note n="5.94.1">τίς is my insertion: Wend. prints δῆλον for the MS.
ἄδηλον, but this does not agree with the sequel. The test
was necessary, because experience shews that without such
a test we may easily be deceived. It would be possible to
read τις indefinte instead of τίς interrogative; but the double
interrogative (what makes who?) is idiomatic Greek. <hi rend="italic">Cf.
De Som.</hi> ii. 296.</note>



<note n="5.95.a">Or “of little value.” Philo interprets the LXX “Let
her have them (i.e. the pledges), but let us never be laughed
to scorn” as meaning that to suppose that the material gift
of the kid should be taken in exchange for the spiritual, would expose the offerer to the charge that he thought the latter of little value (or perhaps unduly depreciated the soul to which the offer is made). It is not so. The offer is the test which every aspiring soul must put to itself.</note>




<note n="5.97.a">The main point of the story of Lev. x. 16-20, some of the
details of which seem to be difficult, is that the goat should
have been eaten by the priests instead of being burnt.
Aaron pleaded in defence “there have befallen me such
things as these,” i.e. the death of his sons Nadab and
Abihu. “In spite of the sacrifice offered on behalf of Aaron
and his house, two of his sons have perished; with such a token of the divine displeasure resting upon him could he, immediately afterwards, feel himself entitled to eat the sacrifice?” (Driver). Philo interprets the goat as Repentance, which is consumed by the fire of unreasoning appetite, and therefore “not found”; and to eat of it and thus to assume a repentance which is not sincere will make the sinner’s condition worse.</note>




<note n="5.98.1">[οὐ]: so Mangey: Wend., who retains it, may have
thought that the βάτος represented the laws of causation in
the visible world while the ἄβατος χῶρος was the supernatural
sphere; but this is impossible in view of τὰς
δὲ αἰτίας . . . μὴ πολυπραγμόνει below. Wend. probably
also did not realize that βάτος was supposed by Greek
philologists to be derived from ἄβατος. It would however
be possible to retain οὐ if a question-mark is placed after
φύσεων (“are not his thoughts busy?”).</note>

<note n="5.102.1">MSS. ἀναιτίους: Mangey ἀναιτίων.</note>



<note n="5.103.a">Since in the other six places where Philo uses the phrase
the quotation comes from Deuteronomy, it is perhaps more
probable that here also he thinks he is quoting that book.</note>


<note n="5.103.b">Or, more fully, “statement of what he thinks (will happen).” For this argument from the indicative form of the words <hi rend="italic">cf. De Ebr</hi>. 138.</note>




<note n="5.104.1">Wendland puts a full stop after αὐτόματα, a colon after

rate seems to me to obscure the connexion of thought. See
note a below.</note>



<note n="5.105.a">The connexion of thought seems to be as follows: to
say that we shall not sow or reap (in the sense of bringing
to the harvest) self-grown plants is a truism. Sowing must
mean “beginning” and reaping “ending” and the text is intended to teach us that all our actions begin and end from God.</note>


<note n="5.105.b">Or “the seventh (anything).” See note on <hi rend="italic">De Mut</hi>. 260. Philo clearly has the sabbatical year in mind as well as the sabbath itself.</note>

<note n="5.108.1">MSS. τῶν αἰσθήσεως ὀργάνων: I retain Wendland’s text
with grave doubt. He bases his correction on the feminine
αἱ. But I see no great difficulty in referring this to the
“faculties” which if they spring from the mind exhibit
themselves in the face. The phrase αἰσθήσεως ὄργανα as
applied to the eyes, etc., is quite common, <hi rend="italic">e.g. De Som.</hi> i. 55,

<note n="5.125.a">The connexion of thought is obscure. Perhaps: the
angel has decreed what the offspring of the Hagar or slave-soul

attribute of God, she naturally gives that name to God’s subordinate
minister.</note>


<note n="5.125.b">E.V. Beer-lahai-roi, explained in the margin as “the well of the living one who seeth me.” Whatever the exact meaning of the LXX was, the next sentence shows that Philo interpreted it as in the translation (ἐνώπιον probably taken as an adjective with αὐτόν understood).</note>
