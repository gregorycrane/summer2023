μυηθέντες, <hi rend="italic">cf. De Cher.</hi> 49, and other allusions to the

that the more picturesque meaning is intended. So Mangey,
who on the strength of these two passages, and the adaptation given of them by Clement, would correct τελεῖσθαι to μυεῖσθαι. But this sense of τελεῖσθαι is quite common in Philo, <hi rend="italic">cf. De Abr</hi>. 122.</note>

<note n="6.313.a">The absence of a finite verb, for οὐσία can hardly be
predicate, is curious. Also the sense is not brought out,
for the sequel shows that the point is that the fire ultimately goes out and leaves the bramble victorious. I strongly suspect that “is destroyed” has been lost and if so φθοροποιεῖται in juxtaposition to φθοροποιός would be preferable to φθείρεται.

<note n="6.325.a">This seems to be the sense required, and so Mangey
“divinitus imperata.” But it is difficult to extract this from
λόγων. λόγου “reason” will make good sense, corresponding to ὁ λόγος below, but in this sense the word does not seem to be used in the plural. If λογίων is read, we must suppose that it is contrasted with χρησμῶν as covering all divine intimations, whereas χρησμῶν is confined to the spoken oracle. But this also lacks authority.</note>

<note n="6.327.a">The above grouping of the ten plagues comples Philo

the birthday of the world (<hi rend="italic">cf. De Op.</hi> 89), but the people had
lost count (see <hi rend="italic">Mos.</hi> ii. 263). Philo probably noticed that
while it was hallowed in Gen. ii., no sign of observation of
it occurred in the narrative till this point. That the seventh
is the “birthday” rather than the sixth, because, though all was completed on the sixth, it was seen in its perfection on the seventh, is stated in <hi rend="italic">De Spec. Leg.</hi> ii. 59.</note>




<note n="6.385.a">In § 209 Philo combines the account of the sending of
quails in Ex. xvi. 13 with that in Num. xi. 31–33. There, as
in Philo, the quails come later than the manna, not, as in
Exodus, before. On the other hand he ignores the statement
in Numbers, that the demand for flesh was punished with a
plague.</note>

<note n="6.414.1">Cohn suggests ἀκκιζόμενος and points out that in § 297, where
ἀκκισμός is clearly right, the majority of MSS. have ἀστεϊσμός.</note>



<note n="6.415.a">Or “cleverly posing.” If ἀστεϊζόμενος is kept we must
suppose that the word, which regularly applies to witty or
ironical talk, is extended to any kind of dissimulation. But
ἀκκιζόμενος, “feigning reluctance,” is easier.</note>


<note n="6.415.b">The Greek is odd. L. &amp; S. give οἱ ὑπὸ πόδα as “those in the rear” and ὑπὸ πόδα χωρεῖν = “recede,” “decline” (of strength), but these are hardly parallels. On the other hand ἐπὶ πόδα (or πόδας) χωρεῖν is a recognized phrase for “retreat” and should perhaps be read here.</note>

As there is nothing corresponding to this sentence in the LXX, it may be assumed that this is a conscious quotation.</note>


<note n="6.421.c">The LXX (v. 10) is ἀποθάνοι ἡ ψυχή μοῦ ἐν ψυχαῖς δικαίων καὶ γένοιτο τὸ σπέρμα μοῦ ὡς τὸ σπέρμα τούτων. E.V. “Let me die the death of the righteous, and let my last end be like his.” Philo’s idea presumably is that the souls of the righteous cannot die in the ordinary sense. For the construction <hi rend="italic">cf. De Gig</hi>. 14. ψυχαὶ . . . μελετῶσαι τὸν μετὰ σωμάτων ἀποθνῇσκειν βίον</note>




<note n="6.422.1">See on <hi rend="italic">De Abr.</hi> 20. Here as in <hi rend="italic">De Decal.</hi> 148, the word
is fairly well suited to the context. The best MSS. have
ἐπαιωρήσας, which does not seem altogether impossible, for
though no similar use of the compound verb is quoted, the
simple verb is found in this sense, e.g. αἰωρεῖν τὰς ὀφρῦς.</note>



<note n="6.423.a">Or “sound and voices” = κληδόνας § 287. In Numbers
Balaam goes to “meet the Lord,” but the account of his purpose given here might be justified from xxiv. 1 “he went not, as at the other times, to meet with enchantments.”</note>


<note n="6.423.b">This is curiously expressed. We expect “returned and uttered” as in Num. xxiii. 17.</note>


<note n="6.423.c">So LXX (διαρτηθῆναι) E.V. “lie” (xxiii. 19).</note>

to refer not to a pestilence sent by God, but to the slaughter
of the guilty. The mistake, if it is a mistake, is not unnatural.
Not only has the mention of the “plague” been
introduced so abruptly that probably something has been lost,
but the coupling of πεπληγυίᾳ, referring to the slain woman, with πληγή in verse 18 (cf. also vv. 14, 15), would lend itself to his interpretation. See further App. pp. 603–604.</note>

<note n="6.501.b">The punctuation and reading suggested in note 1 certainly
make the connexion of thought clearer. If the text is kept,
I take the meaning to be that the table with the food upon it
represents heaven and earth which send the food, and
therefore it is fitting that the other two symbols of heaven
and earth should be set beside it.</note>


<note n="6.501.c">Philo does not expressly derive the -τηριον of θυμιατήριον from τηρεῖν. But as ἐτύμως implies etymological derivation, and in the next words he gives this derivation for θυσιαστήριον, it seems probable that he means it to apply to both words.</note>

<note n="6.503.c">Or “oracle” (LXX λογεῖον τῶν κρίσεων, Ex. xxviii. 15). But Philo clearly uses the word in the sense given in the translation (see §§ 125 and 128), and the same meaning is given to it <hi rend="italic">De Spec. Leg.</hi> i. 87. The E.V. has “breastplate of judgement” though the word translated “breastplate” is said to be rather = “pouch.”</note>

<note n="6.505.a">The apparently traditional idea, which appears again
in § 132, that the inscription on the πέταλον was the “tetragrammaton” YHVH is not borne out by the LXX ἁγίασμα
κυρίου, or the Hebrew and E.V. “Holy (holiness) to the Lord”
(Ex. xxviii. 32 (E.V. 36)). Philo has quoted it correctly <hi rend="italic">De
Mig.</hi> 103. The statement given here is also made by Josephus <hi rend="italic">Bell. Jud.</hi> v. 235 (<hi rend="italic">cf. Ant.</hi> iii. 178). See too App. pp. 608–609.</note>

<note n="6.541.a">The thought of this sentence seems confused. The
permanent triumph of Aaron’s family over the lower Levites
assisted by Reuben was symbolized by the blossoming of the
most permanent of blossoms and so when the πλεονεξία
(“self-assertion”) of mankind as a whole is destroyed,
there will be a permanent blossoming. But of whom?
We expect of all mankind. Instead we have “the priestly tribe.” Is this to be taken literally, or does it stand for Israel, the nation of priests or even for the truly priestly soul? If we could insert ἡ εὐχὴ ὑπὲρ after ὑστάτη the thought would become clear. Philo often insists (<hi rend="italic">e.g. De Spec. Leg</hi>. i. 97), that the prayers of the priests are for the whole human race.</note>

the use of αὐτίκα = “for example” is common enough and fits in well with the general statement in the preceding sentence.</note>




<note n="6.550.1">Cohn puts a note of interrogation here, which I do not
understand. Better perhaps, as two MSS., ὑπειληφώς.</note>



<note n="6.551.a">So LXX Lev. xxiv. 15, 16. E.V. “Whosoever curseth his God shall bear his sin. And he that blasphemeth the name of the Lord shall surely be put to death.” Philo’s explanation is repeated by Josephus, <hi rend="italic">Ant</hi>. iv. 207, <hi rend="italic">Ap</hi>. ii. 237, with reference to Ex. xxii. 28, “Thou shalt not revile God,” where the LXX has θεούς</note>




<note n="6.552.1">Cohn would read ἔτι τοίνυν comparing <hi rend="italic">De Abr.</hi> 158.
But ἐπιχειρῶμεν there is the interrogative subjunctive, ἀξιούσθωσαν
here imperative, i.e. “let them still be thought worthy,
if it is possible” (which of course it is not). In this case it
seems to be better to retain νῦν, and to expunge the mark of
interrogation which Cohn places after ὄνομα.</note>

<note n="6.571.a">This seems the only way of taking the passage as it
stands, but it is most unsatisfactory. For (1) we should
expect τὰ ἴδια, and ἴδια in this position strongly suggests that
it agrees with ταῦτα, and as often = “specially used of”:
(2) The substitution of the payee for the payer is extraordinarily
awkward. The first difficulty might be surmounted by reading ἴδια τῶν &lt;τὰ ἴδια&gt; (W.H.D.R.), but the second would remain. I believe that λαμβανόντων is corrupt, though neither Cohn nor Mangey, who translates “propria recuperantium,” seem to have felt difficulty.</note>
