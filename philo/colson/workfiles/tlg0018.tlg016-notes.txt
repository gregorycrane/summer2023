<note n="4.470.1">MSS. τὸ λογικὸν καὶ τὸ ἄλογον, which might be kept, if with
some MSS. we read ἑκάτερον ἔχειν above for ἑκατέρῳ ὑπάρχειν.</note>



<note n="4.471.a">The allegory of §§ 24–33 is in some ways difficult and very
different from Philo’s usual way of treating the two wives of
Jacob. Elsewhere Rachel is αἴσθησις or σώματος εὐμορφία.
Here no doubt she is connected with τὸ ἄλογον and trains us
through the senses and so far is entitled to have the bodily
function of “swallowing” as her handmaid, but her function
is to teach us the inferiority of sense, while Leah is no longer
the virtue which “refuses” vice and is “weary” with effort (see note on <hi rend="italic">De Cher</hi>. 41), but the virtue which proceeds to noble life without a conflict. In fact, she is rather akin to the αὐτομαθής Isaac, and Rachel to the ἀσκητής Jacob. Why this Leah needs oratorical power for her handmaid is not clear to me.</note>


<note n="4.471.b">Philo here and in § 31 adopts the Epicurean term λεία κίνησις, which he has used with disparagement in <hi rend="italic">De Post</hi>. 79, and with a qualification in <hi rend="italic">De Agr.</hi> 142 (see notes). The name is also derived from the Greek instead of the Hebrew in <hi rend="italic">Leg. All.</hi> ii. 59, but in a somewhat different sense.</note>




<note n="4.472.1">I suspect a lacuna between λογικὴ and σοφισμάτων. See

<note n="4.473.a">See App. p. 577.</note>


<note n="4.473.b">In the interpretation of Zilpah’s name διεξοδικῆς represents
πορευόμενον and ἑρμηνείας (-ευτικῆς) represents στόμα. The
former corresponds to the εὕρεσις of technical rhetoric and thus appears in § 33 as ἡ κατὰ διάνοιαν πηγή. διέξοδος, a rather vague word, signifying a fully worked out narrative or disquisition, is used because the ὅδος in it corresponds to πορευόμενον. Hence the use of the word “course” in the translation.</note>






<note n="4.478.1">So MSS.: Wendland μετέωρα, which the MSS. have in
<hi rend="italic">Leg. All.</hi> iii. 18. The neuter plural seems strange; μετεωρία,
however, is only quoted from Latin writers and in the sense
of “forgetfulness.”</note>

<note n="4.481.a">In the allegory of §§ 45–53, Nahor represents any
philosophy which does not rise to the acknowledgement of
God, not merely astrology, though for a moment in § 49 it
seems to be identified with it. Rather its highest study is
astrology, a science for which, so far as it recognizes the
harmony of the heavens, Philo has considerable respect, cf. <hi rend="italic">De Mig</hi>. 178 ff. Its lower study is sceptical quibbling, and these two represent respectively the lawful wife and the concubine.</note>

<note n="4.489.b">Throughout these sections there is a play upon the
technical literary use of ποίημα and πλάσμα. While ποίημα
in this sense is a poem in general, πλάσμα is used of fictitious
but possible materail such as was used in comedy, while
μῦθος gives the legendary matter which formed the staple of
tragedy. The double use of ποίημα in <hi rend="italic">Quod Det.</hi> 125 is

<note n="4.500.1">MSS. περὶ παντός.</note>




<note n="4.502.1">MSS. τινὰ δὲ ἀθεώρητα πάθους καὶ κακιῶν ἐστὶν.—The text
printed is my conjecture. Mangey retains the MSS. text
and translates, ignoring the neuter τινὰ, “quidam non perpendunt
affectus et vitia.” Markland’s ἅτινα δή is an improvement,
but still leaves ἀθεώρητα in the unnatural sense
of “regardless of” (and therefore “ practising”). Moreover,
the words are quite pointless. With the correction the
argument proceeds quite logically. The later part of the
quotation tells us that he who does God’s ordinances will
live. It follows that the practices of the godless are death.
If you ask what are the practices of the godless, the first
part of the text has told us (εἴρηται) that they are the practices
of Egypt and Canaan, that is (see § 85) passion and vice.
We might perhaps get even nearer to the MSS.by omitting
τὰ before ἀθέων.</note>


<note n="4.502.2">Perhaps read ἀνοσίων ἔργων; general practices are the progenitors of particular deeds.</note>


<note n="4.502.3">MSS.. νομίμω (-ως).</note>


<note n="4.502.4">So one MSS.: the rest εὐχὰς, which Mangey preferred, but see beginning of § 92, and the thought of ἀρχάς recurs in § 110.</note>


<note n="4.502.5">MSS. παρεατέον or παριτέον.</note>



<note n="4.503.a">Or perhaps “the natural (and harmful) ignorance,” which, though a less obvious way of taking the words, agrees better with the thought that ignorance is the πατρίς of the man.</note>




<note n="4.504.1">Some MSS. αὐλῆς: Wend. conjectures ἁλούσης.</note>



<note n="4.505.a">See note on § 59. Here the phrase seems to be used of
the animal or unreasoning nature, ignoring the mind. For
the “city” of the story is Sodom, which is a “soul blind of reason” (§ 109). Wendland’s ἁλούσης (agreeing with πόλεως) may be right.</note>

<note n="4.510.2">MSS. ἱλασμούς.</note>



<note n="4.511.a">The imperfects are difficult. The translation suggests
that though “gnomic” like the aorist ἐτίμησαν, and not
referring specially to the past, they differ from the aorist in
expressing continuity. <hi rend="italic">Cf. Quis Rerum</hi> 17.</note>


<note n="4.511.b">The thought of the section is that the sheep taken on the
tenth day, when the moon is two thirds on its way to fullness,
is an allegory of a soul which has reached a certain stage of progress and preserves (or increases?) it till it reaches its consummation, when it offers itself to God. For the connexion of the sheep with moral progress <hi rend="italic">cf. De Sac.</hi> 112 προκοπῆς δὲ πρόβατον, ὡς καὶ αὐτὸ δηλοῖ τοὔνομα (derived from προβαίνω) σύμβολον. φωτισμός and παραύξησις are the regular terms for the “lighting up” and increasing of the moon.</note>




<note n="4.512.1">MSS. περινοίαν (-ας): Mangey adopted περινοίᾳ, but took
it as “having learnt by sagacity of reason the nothingness,”
etc., a sense which πεποιθυίας cannot, I think, bear. The
translation given above is just grammatical, but awkward in
the extreme. For conjectures see Appendix, p. 579.</note>


<note n="4.512.2">MSS. ἤνθει.</note>



<note n="4.513.a">Though 50 (see § 109) is the leading number in the institution of the Jubilee year, Philo refers to its proclamation on the 10th day of the month.</note>

<note n="4.517.a">Or “chosen (by God) in virtue of the princes’ special
rank or merit”; cf. Plato, <hi rend="italic">Legg.</hi> 855 C τὸ τῶν περυσινῶν
ἀρχόντων ἀριστίνδην ἀπομερισθὲν δικαστήριον. Mangey’s translation,
“per optimates viritim facta collatio,” gives no
adequate sense to ἀριστίνδην.</note>


<note n="4.517.b">There is an obvious play on αὐλή and αὐλαίας which
cannot be reproduced in English.</note>


<note n="4.517.c">Or “the adornment (i.e. the curtains) is perceived by sense.” The translation above is given in the belief that the thought is something less obvious. Philo finding the tabernacle apparently identified with the curtains (ποιήσεις σκηνὴν δέκα αὐλαίας) infers the mystical identity of the two worlds, <hi rend="italic">cf. De Mig.</hi> 205. But it is difficult to extract this sense from the words as they stand. Perhaps read αἰσθητὸς δὲ καὶ κόσμος.</note>


<note n="4.517.d">“dark blue.”</note>




<note n="4.518.1">MSS. ἀντίθετον.</note>


<note n="4.518.2">MSS. ἐκκλησίαν—a very drastic alteration, for which,
however, there seems no alternative; unless indeed we substituted
ἀναδεδίδαχεν for ἀναγέγραφεν. But the congregation
though often called “holy” could hardly be called “divine.”</note>


<note n="4.518.3">All MSS. but one γῆς, which points to Mangey’s conjecture τῆς εἰς Χαναναίων &lt;ἐκ Χαλδαίων&gt; γῆς.</note>




<note n="4.520.1">Some MSS. and Wendland ποῦ.</note>




<note n="4.522.1">MSS. πολλάκις δέ τινα τῶν μέσων ἐπιστημῶν ὑφηγουμένου (-η),
which Mangey keeps with ὑφηγούμενος.</note>


<note n="4.522.2">&lt;μετὰ&gt; is my insertion: Mangey takes πραγμάτων as
object of κυοφορυσι (surely impossible) and reads ὁμοίως for
ὅμως (i.e. all these souls bear in the same way): Wendland
proposed &lt;ἄνευ&gt; πραγμάτων . . . ἀπόνως. I understand Philo
to mean that these souls, before they attain their εὐτοκία,
have to go through the pains suggested by διαστέλλουσαι τὰ
συγκεχυμένα. I have not found the combination μετὰ πραγμάτων
as antithesis to the common ἄνευ, but σὺν πράγμασι and
μετὰ πραγματείας are quoted.</note>



<note n="4.523.a">i.e. grammatically the subject of συνέλαβε may be either. Philo must not be thought to deny that in the literal story the subject must be Tamar, but spiritually both learner and teacher may be said συλλαμβάνειν in its original sense of to seize or take, and he considers himself entitled to find this secondary thought in the text.</note>




<note n="4.524.1">MSS. διανοίαις.</note>

<note n="4.527.a">Or “being of the tribe of Levi and equally fortunate
both on his father’s and his mother’s side, holds fast to
truth.” But the point of the last words is not clear in this
rendering.</note>


<note n="4.527.b">Levi, not Moses as Wendland seems to think. See App. p. 579.</note>


<note n="4.527.c">οὔτως takes us back to the argument, interrupted in § 133 by the meditation on the tribe of Levi, and, as often, marks the conclusion of the argument. In §§ 138–139 we have a different point, though suggested by it.</note>




<note n="4.528.1">MSS. αὐτὸν.</note>



<note n="4.529.a">Philo means that “perfected” or “fully grown” is here
used of things on a lower plane. Since the woman of the
enactment is said “to have in the womb,” the allegory
cannot mean that the perfected work of the mind is one of
moral perfection. It refers rather to the fully formed ideas
produced by “a system of conceptions coordinated for some
useful end” (see the definition of “art” in § 141). Such arts
have nothing wrong about them (ἀνεπιλήπτων), but cannot
rank with the study of virtue. For this reduced sense of
ἀνεπίληπτος see note on <hi rend="italic">De Mig.</hi> 207.</note>


<note n="4.529.b">Or “if there is no physician.” Philo, that is, may not intend to deny the possibility of a better fate for those “who have in the womb.”</note>




<note n="4.530.1">LXX εἶδεν, which perhaps should be read here.</note>


<note n="4.530.2">So LXX ἠτ(ο)ιμάσθη.</note>

App. p. 580.</note>



<note n="4.531.a">See App. 580.</note>


<note n="4.531.b">Or “apprehensions” as below. But the word seems to
be used in a slightly different sense in the two definitions.</note>


<note n="4.531.c">Or perhaps “results arrived at,” in contrast to principles
(δόγματα). That is to say, the difference between δόγματα and θεωρήματα, which are often combined by Philo, lies not so much in that the latter are uncertain (Euclid did not consider his θεωρήματα uncertain), as in that they are slighter, and do not rise to the status of an important principle.</note>




<note n="4.532.1">Wendland supplies οὕτως τέχνη τις τεχνῶν ἐπιστήμη.</note>



<note n="4.533.a">Lit. “through simple applications (of the mind).” <hi rend="italic">Cf.</hi>

γραμματική here given see App. p. 580.</note>


<note n="4.535.b">The word (παρεργολαβεῖν) is not known elsewhere.
L. &amp; S. translate “take as an accessory.” Stephanus
(impossibly) “quaestum ex aliqua re facere.” I understand
the word, in accordance with the common use of πάρεργον for a thing of secondary importance, to imply that they adopt these terms without any thought of how they are arrived at or any conception of their importance.</note>




<note n="4.536.1">τί εὐκτικόν, τί ἀρατικόν is deduced by Wendland from
εὐκτικόν M, ὁρατικόν A, εὗ τί κακὸν ἄρα SF, εὖ κακὸν δὲ τί H.
For ἀρατικόν <hi rend="italic">cf. De Agr.</hi> 140.</note>



<note n="4.537.a">For the explanation of these terms, where they have not been already explained in the note to the parallel passage <hi rend="italic">De Agr.</hi> 140, 141, see App. p. 580. It is a good example of Philo’s capacity for looking at things from opposite points of view, that there these distinctions are scoffed at as superfluous refinements, here they belong to true philosophy.</note>




<note n="4.538.1">MSS.νήπιον.</note>


<note n="4.538.2">MSS.χρεῖος.</note>



<note n="4.539.a">The argument implies that “thy hands” refers to the

<note n="4.541.a">See App. p. 581.</note>


<note n="4.541.b">The article is difficult. The translation assumes that
τοὺς . . . ὑποχρύσους is a belated epithet to ἑαυτούς like οἱ
πανάθλιοι above. But this is very awkward. Perhaps better
“they think themselves to be gods, these gods (of the
pagans) whose very gold and silver is unreal.” There is an allusion to Ex. xx. 23 θεοὺς ἀργυροῦς καὶ θεοὺς χρυσοῦς οὐ
ποιήσετε. For the use of the prefix ὑπ- see App. p. 581.</note>


<note n="4.541.c">As κάκωσις μετὰ νόμου has been stated to be another name for νουθεσία, this remark is extraordinarily weak. See App. p. 582.</note>




<note n="4.543.a">Or “ at the height of its vigour.” But the word is strange
and perhaps to be suspected.</note>


<note n="4.543.b">Though these words run on in the LXX, there is really a
stop at “judgements,” which brings to an end the proof of the connexion of κάκωσις and its bitterness with law. The final words raise a new point, its connexion with “trial.”</note>
