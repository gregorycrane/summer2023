<note n="7.101.a">Or “gods with absolute powers,” see § 13.</note>


<note n="7.101.b">In the MSS. this chapter is headed Περὶ περιτομῆς.</note>


<note n="7.101.c">Or (as Mangey and Heinemann) “in the order indicated
in the scriptures,” i.e. though the laws are not actually
grouped in the Pentateuch under the Ten Commandments,
such an order is suggested by the Decalogue. γραφή, however,
in this sense seems to be regularly coupled with ἱερά. For the meaning given in the translation <hi rend="italic">cf. De Ebr</hi>, 1, <hi rend="italic">De Som.</hi> i. 1.</note>


<note n="7.101.d">For circumcision in Egypt see App. p. 615.</note>



<note n="7.103.a">Or “inward and secret fire.” Lit. “burns smouldering.” Heinemann less accurately, I think, “stark brennt.” Mangey “urit cum inflammatione.”</note>


<note n="7.103.b">Lit. “the likeness,” not meaning that they are naturally alike, but that they are made so by circumcision, for ὁμοιότητα, like ἀπαλλαγήν and καθαριότητα above, must give the result of the process.</note>


<note n="7.103.c">See App. p. 615.</note>



<note n="7.102.1">So Cohn with some MSS. in preference to the ὡς οὐκ εἰκὸς
of the better MSS. This would mean “reflecting that it is not
likely that so many nations would,” etc. (without some good
reason). But this last can hardly be understood, and Mangey
suggests the insertion of μάτην.</note>


<note n="7.102.2">Perhaps, as Cohn suggests, read πόσθης. See <hi rend="italic">Hermes,</hi>
1908, p. 185. The suggestion of ποσθαίνης (H. Grégoire,
<hi rend="italic">Hermes,</hi> 1909, p. 319) is open to the objection that the names of diseases in -αινα, like φλύκταινα and γάγγραινα, do not seem to be formed like the names in -ιτις from the part attacked. The text is very confused in the different MSS.</note>




<note n="7.105.a">Lit. “<hi rend="italic">For</hi> the earliest men.” Here as often in Philo γάρ
refers to the sentence before the last, and gives the reason
why they adopted circumcision. For the attribution of
wisdom to the πρῶτοι <hi rend="italic">cf. De Dec.</hi> 23 σοφοὶ γὰρ ἦσαν, though
there, as in <hi rend="italic">De Op.</hi> 133, it is concerned with the giving of
names to things. In <hi rend="italic">De Plant.</hi> 49 it is as here more general.</note>


<note n="7.105.b">The equation of περιτομή with περιττῆς ἐκτομή is of course an intentional play upon words; or even perhaps an etymology.</note>



<note n="7.107.a">At this point the MSS. insert the heading Οἱ περὶ μοναρχίας
νόμοι, i.e., the laws about the sole sovereignty (of God), and the
chapters which follow down to the end of § 65 are treated by Mangey and others as a separate treatise. Cohn observes this in his numeration of the chapters but not of the sections; see Gen. Introd. p. xviii.</note>



<note n="7.106.1">The variant πρυτανεύοντας is adopted by Heinemann, but
see § 207.</note>




<note n="7.109.a">Deut. iv. 19.</note>



<note n="7.111.a">Here Philo begins the consideration of the second commandment,
though no special heading is given in the MSS.</note>


<note n="7.111.b">Ex. xx. 23. The argument appears to be “if gold and silver idols are forbidden, still more are idols of inferior materials.”</note>


<note n="7.111.c">i.e. in the sphere of human conduct, as opposed to our relation to God, to which the commandment in the literal sense belongs. <hi rend="italic">Cf</hi>. the antithesis of ἠθική and φυσική (in the sense of theological), <hi rend="italic">Mos.</hi> ii. 96.</note>



<note n="7.110.1">Perhaps omit ἐδείμαντο; the sentence is clearer without it.</note>


<note n="7.110.2">MSS. μετ᾿ ἐμὲ or ἐμοὶ or ὑμῖν or omit. Cohn’s adoption
of μετ᾿ ἐμοῦ is based on <hi rend="italic">Leg. All.</hi> i. 51, where the verse is
quoted in most MSS. with μετ᾿ ἐμοῦ, but in one μετ᾿ ἐμὲ. The
MSS. has ὑμῖν αὐτοῖς. In this uncertainty I print Cohn’s text,
but cannot follow his reasoning. Philo does not by any
means always keep the same form in his quotations.</note>



<note n="7.113.a">Lev. xix. 4.</note>


<note n="7.113.b">The argument is “since gold and silver, substances which <hi rend="italic">melt</hi>, are the chief materials of the <hi rend="italic">phantom</hi> wealth, idols (i.e. phantoms) and <hi rend="italic">molten</hi> gods may be understood to indicate riches.” If εἶναι is read instead of χεῖσθαι, the point of χωνευτούς is lost.</note>


<note n="7.113.c">The addition of λεγομένου indicates that the phrase is proverbial or a quotation. See App. pp. 615–616.</note>



<note n="7.112.1">This is the reading of two out of four MSS. supported by
κεῖσθαι of the other two. Cohn, relying on the superior
authority of R, on which see Gen. Introd. pp. xv f., prints
εἶναι. I have retained χεῖσθαι, as it seems to me needed to
bring out the full sense.</note>



<note n="7.115.a">Particularly Heracleitus and his followers. See App.
p. 616.</note>


<note n="7.115.b">I do not know how to translate this phrase. It is said to denote “a sudden or unexpected event,” but this seems to me inadequate. See App. p. 616.</note>


<note n="7.115.c">The regular triple division of music. See note on <hi rend="italic">De Som</hi>. i. 205.</note>



<note n="7.114.1">MSS. φύσιν or φορὰν.</note>


<note n="7.114.2">Cohn suggests (μῦθοι) πάντες, and so apparently Heinemann.
It seems to me needless and less forcible. <hi rend="italic">Cf.</hi> ii. 164
θεῶν . . . οὓς τὸ ποιητικὸν γένος ἐμύθευσε. Mangey reads
with two MSS. ἄλλαι ἀπάται ἃς.</note>




<note n="7.117.a">Deut. iv. 4. The meaning of the original is that all those who took God’s side when the others followed Baal Peor are still alive, Philo has given the same extension of the meaning in <hi rend="italic">De Fuga</hi> 56, and again in § 345 below.</note>


<note n="7.117.b">xxviii. and xxix. for the separate occasions (xxviii. 15, 22, 30; xxix. 5, 11. 22, 25, 28, 31, 34, 38).</note>



<note n="7.119.a">For illustration of the argument in this and the next section see App. p. 616.</note>


<note n="7.119.b">For this use of τροπαί for the transitions of the four seasons rather than for the two solstices cf. τροπὰς τέσσαρας <hi rend="italic">Mos.</hi> ii. 124.</note>



<note n="7.118.1">So Cohn from R in preference to the πλήθουσαν or
πληθύουσαν of the other MSS. It seems to me doubtful. βρίθω
more especially = “laden with,” and so Philo, <hi rend="italic">De Op.</hi> 85
κριοὶ βρίθοντες βαθέσι μαλλοῖς.</note>





<note n="7.123.a">§§ 41–50 are a meditation on Ex. xxxiii. 13–23. The
divine answer to the first petition, “Reveal thyself to me”
(<hi rend="italic">v.</hi> 13), is not reproduced by Philo, but the words of § 43, “I
freely bestow,” etc., are an interpretation of part of God’s
answer to the second petition, “I will be gracious to whom I
will be gracious, and will shew mercy on whom I will shew mercy.” In the second petition (<hi rend="italic">v.</hi> 18), which Philo reads, in accordance with some MSS. of the MSS., as “Shew me thy glory” (so also E.V.), glory is interpreted to mean the Powers as distinguished from the Self-existent, and God’s answer, “Thou shalt see the things behind me,” MSS. τὰ ὀπίσω μου (A.V. “my back parts,” R.V. “my back”), is taken to mean “Thou shalt see what lies behind the Powers, i.e. their manifestation in the sensible world.” The same interpretation of the verse is given in <hi rend="italic">De Fuga</hi> 165, <hi rend="italic">De Mut.</hi> 9, <hi rend="italic">De Post.</hi> 169.</note>



<note n="7.125.a">This must be the meaning if the text is to stand, but what
are “the powers which are now discerned by mind”? The sense to be expected is “I do not mean that they are now discerned,” and so Heinemann and Mangey.</note>



<note n="7.124.1">For οὐχὶ τὰς I suggest οὐχ ὡς. See note <hi rend="italic">a.</hi></note>



<note n="7.127.a">This and § 323 below seem to be the only places where Philo definitely identifies the δυνάμεις with the Platonic ἰδέαι, though perhaps <hi rend="italic">De Cher.</hi> 51 αἱ τυποῦσαι δυνάμεις τὰ ἐν μέρει may imply it.</note>


<note n="7.127.b">i.e. the contemplation must be philosophical, “looking through nature to nature’s God.”</note>


<note n="7.127.c">The subject of ἀποδέχεται is certainly God, but that of καλεῖ and the verbs that follow is more likely Moses. Rapid changes of this kind are not, I think, unusual in Philo.</note>



<note n="7.126.1">Or, as some MSS., ἰδιοποιοῦσι, “give individuality.” It
would be quite in Philo’s way to associate ἴδιος with ἰδέα.</note>


<note n="7.126.2">MSS. μεθαρμόσασθαι, a word less suitable here and often
confused in MSS. with μεθορμίσ. See Cohn, <hi rend="italic">Hermes</hi>, 1908,
p. 186.</note>



<note n="7.129.a">See Lev. xix. 33, 34; Deut. x. 18, 19; E.V. “strangers.” The word of course does not imply conversion to the religion of Israel, as Philo might have seen from “ye were proselytes in Egypt.”</note>


<note n="7.129.b">“Thou shalt love him as thyself,” Lev. xix. 34.</note>


<note n="7.129.c">This is no doubt mainly based on Ex. xxii. 28, “Thou shalt not revile God,” where the LXX has θεούς. See <hi rend="italic">Mos.</hi> ii. 203 and note, with references to Joseph us. But that passage shews that he gave the same interpretation to Lev. xxiv. 15, “whosoever curseth God shall bear the guilt of his sin,” on the grounds that as this is treated as a lesser sin than naming the name of the Lord, it could not refer to the true God.</note>



<note n="7.128.1">MSS. οἰκιῶν.</note>


<note n="7.128.2">So Cohn: Mangey on the other hand expunges αὐτοῖς,
which is absent in three MSS., and retains ἐπηλύταις. Against
Cohn it may be said that it is not clear why the order which
follows should be addressed to the proselytes instead of to
Israel (unless on the ground that converts or perverts are apt
to be particularly severe to their former co-religionists). If
ἐπηλύταις is retained a fair sense can be obtained. The
honours awarded by God to converts from the outside
religions might naturally be regarded as a signal evidence
of the abhorrence which these religions deserve.</note>



<note n="7.131.a">For this section cf. Deut. xiii. 12 ff., and xvii. 6 ff., though
there a stricter inquiry is enjoined than what is suggested
here. On this and Jewish lynching in general see App.
pp. 616–618.</note>


<note n="7.131.b">Or “governor (of a nome).” See note on <hi rend="italic">De Jos.</hi> 3. Goodenough, “Roman magistrates.”</note>


<note n="7.131.c">See Num. xxv. ff. The story of Phinehas, used for allegorical purposes in <hi rend="italic">De Pout.</hi> 182 ff., <hi rend="italic">De Ebr.</hi> 73 ff., <hi rend="italic">De Conf.</hi> 57, has been given in much the same terms as here, though more fully, in <hi rend="italic">Mos.</hi> i. 301 ff.</note>



<note n="7.130.1">MSS. ἀθύτοις.</note>




<note n="7.133.a">The allusion is to Lev. xix. 28 (<hi rend="italic">cf. ib.</hi> xxi. 5, Deut. xiv. 1),
“Ye shall not make any cuttings in your flesh for the dead
(LXX ἐπὶ ψυχῇ), nor print any marks upon you,” which Philo
takes to refer to idolatrous practices. Such connexion as there
is with the preceding section lies in the antithesis between
bondage to God and bondage to idols. See App. p. 618.</note>


<note n="7.133.b">Not very clear. It obviously cannot refer to the preceding section, nor very appropriately to §§ 56, 57. For Philo does not go on to suggest that the persons now described should be lynched or even judicially executed, but merely excluded, though Lev. xx. 6 and 27 sanction the penalty of death. See App. p. 618.</note>



<note n="7.135.a">These terms are largely drawn from Deut. xviii. 10 f.
where we have περικαθαίρων τὸν υἱὸν ἐν πυρί, κληδονιζόμενος,
οἰωνιζόμενος, φαρμακὸς ἐπαείδων ἐπαοιδήν, τερατοσκόπος. Philo’s
καθαρτής, which Heinemann translates by “Sühnepriester,” evidently corresponds to the περικαθαίρων of Deut. (E.V. “makes his son to pass through fire”). Κλῃδόσι, <hi rend="italic">cf. Mos.</hi> i. 287, may mean “omens” generally. The “haruspex” naturally has no place in Deut., as the O.T., I believe, shews no trace of divining by entrails of victims, θύτης is given in L.&amp; S. revised as “diviner,” but is clearly more specific.</note>





<note n="7.134.1">MSS. ἰδίας or mostly ἀιδίου. The adjective has -ος, -α, -ον
or -ος, -ον indifferently.</note>


<note n="7.136.1">Here the MSS. insert the heading Περὶ ἱεροῦ.</note>


<note n="7.137.a">See Deut. xviii. 15–18.</note>


<note n="7.137.b">So (<hi rend="italic">v.</hi> 18), “I will put my words in his mouth and he
shall speak unto them all that I shall command him.”</note>


<note n="7.137.c">For the idea of insistence and reiteration in ἐνηχεῖν (in colloquial English “to drum or din into one”) see note on <hi rend="italic">De Mut.</hi> 57. For the general sense of the passage <hi rend="italic">cf. Quis Rerum</hi> 265 f.</note>


<note n="7.137.d">The MSS. insert the heading “Of the temple,” and Cohn begins a fresh numeration of chapters.</note>




<note n="7.139.a">Cf. <hi rend="italic">Mos.</hi> ii. 288.</note>


<note n="7.139.b">See Deut. xii. 5–7, 11–14, 17–18. See also App. p. 618.</note>




<note n="7.141.a">Lit. “they are at leisure with the most necessary leisure.”
For this use of ἀναγκαῖος cf. § 54 above. Possibly, however,
“the leisure which they are compelled by the nature of the
circumstances to have,” and so perhaps Heinemann (“unentbehrlicher”). But the cognate accusative, as used by Philo,
seems to me to point clearly to the rendering in the translation.</note>


<note n="7.141.b">Here the MSS. insert a heading Περὶ τοῦ ἱεροῦ, and Cohn
begins a fresh numeration of the chapters, as in § 12. For
a note on the description which follows see App. pp. 618–619.</note>


<note n="7.141.c">i.e. with two rows of pillars (so Heinemann).</note>


<note n="7.141.d">See Lev. xvi. 34 and <hi rend="italic">cf</hi>. Hebrews ix. 7, and in Philo, <hi rend="italic">De Ebr</hi>. 136, <hi rend="italic">De Gig</hi>. 52. Philo, however, seems to make a strange mistake, as it is only “the holy place within the veil” to which this applies. In § 274 and § 296 below he clearly states that the other priests had access to the rest of the sanctuary.</note>


<note n="7.141.e">See Lev. xvi. 12, 13.</note>



<note n="7.143.a">See Deut. xvi. 21. LXX ἄλσος, R. V. Asherah. Hecataeus

<note n="7.145.b">Here the MSS. give the heading “Of the priests,” but
Cohn does not begin a new numeration of chapters.</note>


<note n="7.145.c">The allusion is of course to the slaughter of the Calf- worshippers by the Levites in Ex. xxxii. As to the statement that the Levites received their consecration as a reward for this, a statement made by Philo also in his longer account of the event in <hi rend="italic">Mos.</hi> ii. 160 f. and repeated in <hi rend="italic">Spec.

<note n="7.149.e">§§ 84–94.

Urim and Thummim), § 88, and of the Bells, § 93, were, together with a comparison of the interpretation of the Bells in <hi rend="italic">De Miff.</hi> 102 f., discussed in the note in Vol. VI. p. 609, and the discussion need not be repeated here.</note>



<note n="7.148.1">καὶ τὰς εὐχὰς is omitted in the other MSS. and appears in
R as καὶ τὰς followed by a word which Cohn prints as εὐχὰς ?.
He does not say anything about the Armenian. See App.
p. 620.</note>



<note n="7.151.a">If I understand Philo aright, this description of the dress identifies what in <hi rend="italic">Mos.</hi> ii. 109 is called the ἐπωμίς (there translated “ephod”) with the λογεῖον or “oracle of judgement” (for the translation “reason-seat” see note on <hi rend="italic">Mos.</hi> ii. 112), while there the λογεῖον is attached by chains to the ἐπωμίς.</note>

<note n="7.150.1">So R and the Armenian. The other MSS. have φῶς ἥλιος or
φῶς ἥλιος δ᾿. Cohn prints φῶς, ἡλίου ἥλιος, appealing to § 279
below, but there the “sun’s sun” is God. He also cites
(<hi rend="italic">Hermes,</hi> 1908, p. 187) <hi rend="italic">De Op.</hi> 31 as representing light as
the source of the sun, but that light is the φῶς νοητόν, an
idea which is not, I think, suited to this passage. For
further discussion see App. p. 620.</note>




<note n="7.155.a">See Lev. x. 8–11, and <hi rend="italic">cf. De Ebr.</hi> 130 f.</note>

the τὸ πᾶν of others. On ἱερωμένον see App. p. 620.</note>



<note n="7.157.a">The words in inverted commas are an almost exact quotation of Lev. x. 10, but the addition “lawful and unlawful,” also represents <hi rend="italic">v.</hi> 11 “to teach the sons of Israel all the statutes” (LXX νόμιμα).</note>


<note n="7.157.b">Or “primarily a man, and only secondarily a priest,”
πολὺ πρότερον not indicating time or even importance, but that the genus comes before the species.</note>



<note n="7.156.1">MSS. νηφάλια.</note>



<note n="7.159.a">See Lev. xxi. 7 (not as Cohn, 13, 14, which refer to the
high priest), “They shall not take a woman that is a harlot
or profane, or a woman put away from her husband.” By a
“pure virgin” Philo, as appears from § 108, means that if
she is unmarried she must be pure. The instruction to
inquire into her lineage has no scriptural authority. But
Josephus, <hi rend="italic">Contra Apion.</hi> i. 31, entirely supports it as a practice, “He must inquire into her pedigree, obtaining the genealogy from the archives and producing a number of witnesses.” Josephus goes on to say that the practice is observed among the Jews of Egypt, Babylonia, and elsewhere, as much as in Palestine.</note>

<note n="7.161.a">Lev. xxi. 13, 14.</note>


<note n="7.161.b">i.e. successive high priests. The use of the plural is
odd and might suggest that it refers to the couple; and so apparently Heinemann takes it, but it seems to me impossible that Philo should be supposing that the high priest’s character is moulded by his wife.</note>


<note n="7.161.c">See on <hi rend="italic">Spec. Leg.</hi> iii. 72 (App.).</note>




<note n="7.163.a">Or “ordinary.” So Heinemann; Mangey “privatis.”
But all these are strange uses for the phrase which should
mean the several or particular priests, like οἱ κατὰ μέρος νόμοι.
Possibly it means the priests who stood by themselves as a
μέρος of the whole class, the other μέρος being the high priest,
and so almost = “as a class.” So perhaps ἄρχοντος ἐν μέρει,
§ 226.</note>


<note n="7.163.b">Lev. xxi. 7. The permission is reasonably deduced from
the prohibition to marry the divorced.</note>


<note n="7.163.c">As the jealousy is clearly that felt by one or both of the husbands, I do not see the point of “feminine” unless it means that such a feeling is natural in a woman, but disgraceful to a man. Some word expressing “excited by a passion for women,” like γυναικομανοῦς, seems to be wanted.</note>


<note n="7.163.d">So Philo interprets Lev. xxi. 14 ἐκ τοῦ γένους αὐτοῦ and in the next verse, ἐκ τοῦ λαοῦ αὐτοῦ (E.V. “of his own people”).</note>

<note n="7.169.a">See Lev. xxii. 10. Philo evidently takes πάροικος = “neighbour” (a sense which the word no doubt can bear). E.V. “sojourner,” presumably meaning a stranger residing temporarily (?) with the priest.</note>

<note n="7.168.1">Some MSS. μὴ πάντες γείτονες, and so Mangey, who

<note n="7.171.a">See Lev. xxii. 10: LXX ἀλλογενής, E.V. “stranger,” meaning
“one who is not a priest.” The word might mean
“foreigner,” but as the LXX uses the same word in <hi rend="italic">v.</hi> 12,
where Philo interprets it as a non-priest (§129), he probably
means the same here.</note>

have no part nor inheritance with Israel. The offerings
(καρπώματα) of the Lord shall be their inheritance, they shall
eat them, and they shall have no inheritance among their
brethren. The Lord Himself is their inheritance.” Philo
sees that in this text “the offerings of the Lord are their
inheritance” is equivalent to “the Lord is their inheritance,”
and explains the latter phrase as meaning (1) they share the offerings with the Lord; (2) as consecrating the offerings they are trustees and managers of the “inheritances.” ἐπιμεληταὶ τῶν κλ. seems to be a technical term for the commoner ἐπίτροποι = “executors.” <hi rend="italic">Cf.</hi> Diog. Laert. v. 55, 56.

of that curious passage, that the liver acts as a mirror “which
receives outlines of the thoughts from the brain and exhibits
reflections from them,” sometimes of a bitter nature, while
sometimes “the part of the soul settled about the liver is
enabled to secure a sober amusement at night, enjoying
divination during sleep in recompense for its deprivation of
intelligence and wisdom.” Whether Philo has otherwise
understood Plato correctly I do not presume to say. bitterness.” Some stress is laid on its position, but there is nothing corresponding to μετέωρος. Can the word mean here “with changing moods,” “temperamental,” and refer to the mixture of sweetness and bitterness ascribed to it by Plato?</note>

overlaid with gold. The “unhewn stones” seems to be drawn from Ex. xx. 25, “And if thou make me an altar of stone thou shalt not build it of hewn stones.” Philo’s description may be derived from personal observation, for Josephus, <hi rend="italic">Contra Apion</hi>. i. 198 quotes a passage ascribed to Hecataeus (4th–3rd century LXX), in which he states, when speaking of the temple at Jerusalem, that the altar is built of heaped up stones unhewn and unwrought.

<note n="7.265.a">The heading here introduced, “Of the other matters concerning
the altar,” which, as no later heading is given,
presumably extends to the rest of the treatise, is almost as absurd as the last. At the best it only serves for a description of §§ 285–295. In §§ 296–298 we pass on to the lamps, and after that to general reflections on the morality enjoined in the cult.

<note n="7.273.b">That the rest of this section from “Among all these”
cannot possibly be in its right place, as it is quite irrelevant
to the context, is, as Cohn and Heinemann agree, quite indisputable.
But it seems to me that it does not make sense
in itself, and that Heinemann’s admission that it is not “ganz
klar” understates the facts. As Cohn prints it, as indicated
in the textual notes, it appears to state that all the other parts
of the universe (except God?) “have betterment,” and to illutrate
this we are told that the mountains rise to a very great
height, the plains get wider, etc. (In this part it is hard to
see why ἤ is used instead of καί.) At the end it appears that contrary to what has been said (μὲν οὖν) they remain exactly as they were from the first.</note>

<note n="7.285.b">Philo’s authority in Deuteronomy for this section is xxiii. 17, 18, where, after the words “there shall be no harlot of the daughters of Israel, neither shall there be a sodomite (LXX fornicator) of the sons of Israel,” the LXX adds, “there shall be no τελεσφόρος among the daughters, nor τελεσφόρος among the sons.” L.&amp; S. (1936) give for τελεσφόρος “sorceress,” and for τελισκόμενος “initiate” or ἱερόδουλος.

continuation of the passage quoted from Deut. xxiii. “an
Ammonite or a Moabite shall not enter into the assembly
of the Lord.” Philo does not actually quote the verse,
possibly feeling that the arguments which lead him to the
identification are too involved for this treatise. But that this
is his meaning clearly appears from <hi rend="italic">Leg. All.</hi> iii. 81, when, after noting that Amnion and Moab refused to give food to Israel, he described the Ammonites as deriving their nature from “sense” (αἴσθησις) their mother, and the Moabites from “mind” their father, the latter name being interpreted as ἐκ πατρός (<hi rend="italic">cf. De Som.</hi> i. 89 and LXX, Gen. xix. 37, “she called his name Moab, saying ἐκ τοῦ πατρός μου”). Philo does not, I think, give any corresponding derivation for Ammon, but Heinemann suggests that he derived it from the Hebrew LXX= “mother,” see Gen. xix. 38 E.V. “and she called his name Benammi” (LXX ἐκ τοῦ γένους μου). <hi rend="italic">Cf.</hi> also <hi rend="italic">De Post.</hi> 177.

very similar to this, “the most incredible thing is that

147, where man is said to be χερσαῖον ζῷον on land, and
ἔνυδρον when he sails in ships. The analogy with <hi rend="italic">Spec. Leg.</hi> is not quite exact as there πλωτῆς is passive, while here it would be on Heinemann’s rendering active. His other argument that dry land does not become a waterway might be met by supposing that Philo is thinking of Xerxes’ canal through Mount Athos, on which he enlarges in De Som. ii. 118.

<note n="7.314.1">Cohn following Mangey prints for the τῆς παραβάσεως of
the MSS. βεβαιώσεως. I have hesitated in making the correction
printed above, because it seems strange that anything
so obvious should have escaped Mangey, Cohn, Heinemann
and others. But I can see nothing against it. The double
negative is rather effective than otherwise. The omission of
the negative in the MSS. of Philo is common (see in this
treatise §§ 129, 132), and Philo was no doubt familiar with
the use of οὐ with a substantive, as τὴν τῶν γεφυρῶν . . . οὐ

apparently is a solemn appeal in the name of God to give
witness (as in the banns of marriage). Philo takes the Greek
word for adjuration ὁρκισμός as = “(false) swearing.”</note>

and continues in the same order as in this book, with the
sole exception that the Sheaf is not mentioned.

like the other names, Pythagorean. As Philo understands it here, we may perhaps say that it is personified like τύχη, of which it is the converse, and represents the due order in which events happen. See further App. p. 624.</note>

<note n="7.347.a">The meaning of ὡς ἔπος εἰπεῖν is not quite clear. Generally,
if not always, it is applied to a general statement, mostly
numerical, to indicate that it is not exact. Perhaps it may mean here that it would be possible to find more than two main heads, or other than these two. Heinemann translates “so zu sagen,” but I do not see what this means here, even if the Greek can be so translated.</note>

Strict modern Sabbatarians would probably feel the same.</note>

thinks possible, παντάπασι, φησί. Nicetas’s paraphrase, however,

the form here printed.</note>

<note n="7.363.a">The correction suggested by Mangey and Heinemann
(see note 2, p. 360) would make sacrificing revenues parallel to
letting the land lie idle. I think the text is better as it stands.
Leaving the land idle teaches the poorer to stand the privation,
and the richer to sacrifice wealth voluntarily.</note>


<note n="7.363.b">The allusion, which neither Cohn nor Heinemann notices,
is to Plato, <hi rend="italic">Phaedrus</hi> 239 C, where ξηροὶ ἱδρῶτες are coupled
with πόνοι ἀνδρεῖοι, and contrasted with ἁπαλὴ καὶ ἄνανδρος δίαιτα. The commentators take the phrase as meaning Sweats in the gymnasium as opposed to sweating in the baths, and so with the verb ξηραλοιφεῖν. Philo, however, does not use it in this sense, but for toil-enduring people in general who are in his eyes the true athletes. On the depreciation of athletes see App. pp. 625–626.</note>

A simpler sense might be obtained, particularly if the question

and supposes them to express something like “confirming
the sense of fellow-feeling.” I do not think the meaning I
have given to them, “those which have a nature common to
the others” (and are not ἐξαίρετα), is impossible, though the
nearest example I can find, iii. 182 μηδεμίαν ἔχοντα κοινωνίαν,
is not quite analogous. For παρά cf. παρὰ ταύτας § 216, and
for the antithesis ἐξαίρετον—κοινός § 190. Mangey’s translation, lation, “supra ea quae ad vulgares annos pertinent,” is not unlike mine except that he takes παρά = “beyond,” and seems to see in κοινωνίαν the idea of ordinariness. If my view is right, the reference may be to Lev. xxv. 11, where the rules for the Sabbatical year are repeated, also to the liberation of slaves and remission of debts (cf. § 122).</note>

Cohn thinks that a connexion is to be found in Lev. xxv. 46, where after permitting the purchase of foreign slaves it continues “ye shall make them an inheritance” (LXX καταμεριεῖτε, “ye shall distribute”) “to your children.” If this is right, it can hardly be doubted, as Cohn says, that some words have fallen out which would shew the connexion.</note>

of the body, and no doubt also the crossing of the Red Sea.
In classical Greek διαβατήρια are offerings made before

Though we find the sun and moon coupled with the “other stars,” and included in the “seven stars,” there would be no point here in speaking of them as “the stars.” Presumably ἀλλήλοις ἀντιπαραχωρούντων is loosely used for “as one gives way to another,” and they are mentioned as reinforcing the light of the moon.</note>

<note n="7.407.a">Or “This follows from the fact that,” etc. For the
following sections cf. i. 97, though there it is the high priest,
and not the Jewish nation, who prays for the world. Heinemann notes that it is curious that the sections which follow emphasizing the world-priesthood of the Jewish race should be connected with the comparatively insignificant rite of the Sheaf, particularly as Philo in <hi rend="italic">De Som.</hi> ii. 75 has laid down that the sheaf must be taken from the holy land. But the sheaf is actually the first-fruit of the whole harvest, the accomplishment of which is celebrated in the feasts of Weeks and Tabernacles. Philo does not argue the world-priesthood from the rite, but asserts it as a fact shewn by (1) the obedience of Israel to the divine law; (2) its unique monotheism, and argues from it that the Sheaf, and by implication the other thank-offerings, are world-extensive. That he should attach this argument to the first example is not unnatural.</note>



<note n="7.406.1">Cohn prints here καὶ τὸν ὄχλον &lt;τῆς ψυχῆς ἐχαλίνωσαν,

insertion is, as he says, only “exempli gratia,” and does not
seem particularly happy. Philo is amplifying κατὰ σῶμα καὶ
κατὰ ψυχὴν, and as we take up ψυχὴ in ἔτι δὲ καὶ κτλ. it
seems out of place here. Something is certainly needed after
ὄχλον, but αὐτῶν would be in itself enough, or αὐτῶν ἐχαλίνωσαν

because the loaves, though given to the Lord (Lev. xxiii. 20), are also received back from Him (“they shall be holy to the Lord for the priest that offers them”). It seems to be assumed that therefore they must be brought in the most palatable form, cf. § 184, presumably because it is a festal occasion, as the unleavened shew-bread was also eaten by the priests.</note>

<note n="7.423.b">Cohn’s rejection of ἀλλ᾿ οὐ σῖτος as “a foolish insertion” rests on the ground that the antithesis is between the wheaten loaves and other kinds of grain.

<note n="7.439.b">One would expect ἰσημερίας or the omission of ὥρας, in
which case ἑορτῆς would be understood. And so Heinemann,
“Frühlingsfest.” But ὥρας may be justified perhaps on the
ground that §§ 151 f. dealt rather with the spring as a whole
than with the equinox in particular.</note>


<note n="7.439.c">See Lev. xxiii. 36, Num. xxix. 35. This is “the last day,
the great day of the feast” in John vii. 37. The word ἐξόδιον
is used both in Leviticus and Numbers; E.V. “solemn
assembly,” but in R.V. marg. “closing festival.”</note>


<note n="7.439.d">For the general idea <hi rend="italic">cf. De Op.</hi> 98, where plane geometry
(γεωμετρία) and solid geometry (στερεομετρία) are identified
respectively with things incorporeal and corporeal, though
the equation of ἀσώματα to νοητά is something of an extension. By δυνάμει, represented in the translation by “higher,” he means, perhaps, that solidity is gained by raising to a higher power in the mathematical sense = παραυξήσεσι below. But this technical use is generally, if not always, confined to the second power or square (as in § 177) and the meaning may be less technical = “in nature” or “value.” παραυξήσεσι is taken by Heinemann to mean the increase from 7 to 8. My preference for the rendering given above rests on the use of the plural (unless this may be accounted for by the plural νοητά). As I understand it, 1 = the point, 2 = the line, 4 = the superficies, and 8 = the solid. So in <hi rend="italic">De Op.</hi> 91, 93 and 94 παραυξηθείς and παραύξων are used of the processes by which 1 is raised by multiples of 2 to 64, and 3 to 729. See further App. p. 628.</note>


<note n="7.439.e">Here the word πλήρωμα, used in § 200 in the sense of sum or fullness, = that which fills up. For examples of both these senses see L.&amp; S. revised.</note>

<note n="7.440.1">With λόγον ἐχούσης Nicetas’s excerpts come to an end,
and the rest of the treatise depends solely on M and does not
appear in Mangey at all. For the lacuna Heinemann
suggests something like the following: “&lt;but it is prescribed
that people should enjoy themselves at the feasts” (Lev.
xxiii. 40 and elsewhere) “because&gt; folly and joy &lt;are irreconcilable
opposites&gt;.” It is certainly quite possible that some
lost clause or clauses ended up with &lt;ἐναντία&gt; ἀφροσύναι καὶ
εὐφροσύναι (cf. the same antithesis in § 49), but the rest of
Heinemann’s suggestion does not seem to me suitable.
Apart from these three words, which may have intruded
through some now inexplicable accident, the whole section
reads like a continuous apology for the length at which the
fourth commandment is treated compared with the third and
fifth, the defence being (1) the sanctity of seven (διὰ τὴν ἱερὰν
ἑβδόμην); (2) the intrinsic value of the feasts (καὶ διότι ἐν . . . ).
If something has really been lost I should rather suppose that it continued μητρὸς λόγον ἐχούσης with “to those who feast” (or “to feasts conducted”) “religiously, and not with folly, for .folly and joy are incompatible.” This certainly presupposes that Nicetas had the same corruption before him as we have, but I know no reason to the contrary.</note>

<note n="7.445.a">See note 1. The second of these suggestions, which is
what Heinemann actually translates, seems to me quite pointless. I understand the text to mean that the same growers may find their fruits ripening at different times in different years. This of course in itself would prevent a fixed date for the ceremony.</note>

As the words stand in the text they should mean “made them to be non-existent,” for ἐργάζομαι does not appear to be used absolutely = “create.” the other hand, ἐργάζεσθαί τινά τι = “to render a person something” (adjective) is a known construction used by Philo, <hi rend="italic">e.g. De Agr.</hi> 58 τὸν λαὸν . . . φιλήδονον . . . ἐργάσηται, <hi rend="italic">cf. Quod Deus</hi> 43, <hi rend="italic">De Sac.</hi> 48.

glosses (surely odd glosses) to ἀκμάζουσι, and apparently
takes the next words as = “impressing thoughts on those of the
children who are in their prime” (so also Heinemann). But
this use of ἀκμάζουσι παίδων for τοῖς ἀκμάζουσι τῶν παίδων,

impossible. For a tentative suggestion see App. pp. 628–629.</note>

inferred his insignificance either from his collecting firewood,
or from the absence of any mention of his name. If this is
not mere inadvertence, he must have considered that οὐχί
should be expunged. But his explanations of the man’s insignificance are very unconvincing, and, as the A of Philo do not shew as much tendency to insert negatives as they do to omit them, the text may stand, though I know of no explanation of Philo’s statement that the offender was of high rank.</note>


<note n="7.463.g">Or “with the result that he displayed.” This is perhaps an unusual meaning for εἰς. Heinemann gives “with the intention of shewing,” but this would need ἐξῄει λόγῳ μέν rather than ἐξῄει μέν.

<note n="7.465.e">Not, I think, “lightly,” “thoughtlessly,” as Heinemann (“leichtfertig”). The sense of “falsely” is not uncommon in classical Greek. Philo uses μάτην to bring it into connexion with the ἐπὶ ματαίῳ of the commandment, and to suggest that perjury is included in “taking in vain.”</note>

<note n="7.467.b">Lit. “both speaking and prophesying,” meaning perhaps that though it is Moses speaking he is also God’s spokesman, or that sometimes he speaks in his own person and sometimes as the spokesman.

In the parallel passage, xx. 20, the R.V. has “uncle’s wife” simply, but Philo would read in the LXX τῆς συγγενοῦς αὐτοῦ.</note>

<note n="7.491.a">In these two sections Philo follows closely Lev. xviii. 18,
“thou shalt not take a woman to her sister to be a rival to
her, to uncover her nakedness beside the other in her lifetime.”
The LXX for “rival,” ἀντίζηλος, suggests even better
than the R.V. the idea of jealousy which Philo stresses.
Nothing is said in Leviticus of the deceased wife’s sister,
nor by Philo, though his argument suggests that he would
not object to it He also says nothing about marriage with
a brother’s wife, though that is forbidden in <hi rend="italic">v.</hi> 16. Possibly
he did not see how to reconcile it with the express injunction of such a marriage, “to raise up seed to the brother,” in Deut. xxv. 5 ff.</note>


<note n="7.491.b">If εἰ is read for εἴτε (see note 1), the meaning will be
“while his (former) partner is alive, even though she has been divorced.” This certainly best suits the rest of the sentence, which is confined to the case of the divorced wife. On the other hand it strains the meaning of the present participle τῆς συνοικούσης and leaves out of consideration τῷ αὐτῷ χρόνῳ above, which clearly contemplates the possibility of bigamy.</note>



<note n="7.490.1">Perhaps read εἰ. See note <hi rend="italic">b.</hi></note>




<note n="7.493.a">Ex. xxxiv. 16, Deut. vii. 3 (here, as also in §§ 30, 31,
Philo digresses from his interpretation of the prohibitions in
Lev. xviii.). Though the prohibition in both Exodus and
Deuteronomy is against intermarriage with the conquered
Canaanites, the motive assigned, viz. fear of contamination
with heathenism, is naturally regarded as making it
a general ordinance. Josephus also appeals to it in condemnation
of Solomon, <hi rend="italic">Ant.</hi> viii. 191.</note>


<note n="7.493.b">Deut. xxiv. 4, where such an act is described as an
abomination before the Lord, and defiling (LXX) the land.
Though no penalty is mentioned, Philo, perhaps not unreasonably, interprets these strong phrases as describing an act deserving the death penalty, but is hard put to justify it. Apparently he understands the text as meaning that the remarriage shews that there was no real reason for the divorce. The woman is therefore “defiled” and an adulteress, and he not only a “pander,” but an adulterer, either because he has connived at her adultery or perhaps because to marry an adulteress is in itself adultery. See further, App. p. 633.</note>



<note n="7.495.a">Lev. xviii. 19 (cf. Ezekiel, xviii. 6). Here Philo resumes
his interpretation of Lev. xviii. and, except for §§ 34–36, continues it in the same order to the end of § 53. He omits vv. 20, 21, the first denouncing simple adultery, already dealt with, the second against offering children to Moloch, which has no connexion with his present subject, even if he understood it, which is hardly possible, as the LXX has “give thy seed to serve the ruler.”</note>

<note n="7.519.d">The curious word ὑπογάμιον occurs only here. The suggestion
in the translation is that it is formed on the analogy
of the not uncommon use of ὑπό = “just before.” But except for the epic adjectives ὑπηοῖος and ὑποδείελος, I cannot find any analogous compounds. However, ὑπὸ γόμον would be an easy correction. The general opinion seems to be that the ὑπό suggests “secret” or “illicit,” and presumably this is the idea in Mangey’s “interceptus concubitus,” and L.&amp; S.’s “illicit intercourse with a betrothed person.” Also the word seems to be regularly regarded as a substantive. It seems to me more likely that it is an adjective agreeing with ἀδίκημα.</note>

<note n="7.521.a">Deuteronomy makes no suggestion of a documentary form
of betrothal, though it speaks of a “bill of divorcement”
(xxiv. 3). But Philo naturally reads into it the practice of his
own time. See App. pp. 634–635.</note>

required to bind and gag her before she could cry out.
Perhaps, however, τῶν ἄλλων is neuter, i.e. “besides the rest
of his violence”; translate, “if he further proceeds to bind
her.” Cohn, who originally suggested the correction mentioned
in note 1, came to the conclusion (<hi rend="italic">Hermes</hi>, 1908,
p. 205) that this solution was satisfactory. He compares
<hi rend="italic">De Dec.</hi> 69.</note>


<note n="7.523.b">For §§ 79–83 see Deut. xxii. 13–21. Philo’s account makes no mention of the “tokens of virginity.” Also there is no allusion to the order that if the case is given against the wife she is to be stoned. This is perhaps because the real subject of these sections is the misconduct of husbands who make treacherous attempts to get rid of unwanted wives. Still, the omission is curious. Apart from the concealment, the misconduct of the woman is not, or need not be, ὑπογάμιον, and falls under the head of φθορά, which Philo has treated as an ἀτύχημα to the maiden rather than a crime (§ 70). One would expect an explanation of why the extreme penalty was required.</note>

women, nor according to Heinemann any rabbinical tradition.
It may be regarded as a slip of memory, perhaps
induced by the similar liberty allowed to the seduced maidens
in § 71.</note>


<note n="7.527.b">At this point Philo turns to the sixth (his seventh) commandment,
and this takes up the rest of the treatise. The
transition is abrupt (though not more so than that from the
first to the second commandment in i. 21) and suggests that he may himself have headed these chapters with the words of the commandment, as he must have done with the ninth in iv. 41.</note>

<note n="7.529.a">For death as a penalty for killing a man see Ex. xxi. 12;

<note n="7.529.b">The translation follows the suggestion in note 2. The πλῆθος is ἀθάνατον because if a punishment can be repeated it is “deathless” in the sense that it does not involve death.</note>


<note n="7.529.c">Philo is here giving his interpretation of Ex. xxi. 14, as it is in the LXX. Where the E.V. has “if a man come presumptuously upon his neighbour to slay him with guile,” the LXX. has ἐπιθῆται, which Philo understands to mean “if he attack him, even if he does not succeed.” This appears from <hi rend="italic">De Conf.</hi> 160, where he takes the same text as shewing that the intention to kill is the same as actually killing, because the word used is ἐπιτίθεσθαι, not ἀναιρεῖν. See App. p. 635.</note>



<note n="7.528.1">I suggest εἰ καὶ δὴ: Cohn καίτοι. The difficulty of logic
in “because” would be eased if ἀμειλίκτως is inserted before
ἀμείλικτα, the thought being that since he can have only one
death, that must be inflicted without mercy. Even so,
however, “although” is to be expected. For εἰ καὶ δὴ cf.
εἰ καί, § 86, and εἰ δή, § 132.</note>


<note n="7.528.2">This is certainly corrupt. The simplest emendation, as
it seems to me, will be to suppose some word lost before
ἀθάνατον, which will then be taken with πλῆθος. The word
which I should suggest is ἑνικὸν, the regular term in grammar
for the “singular” opposed to “πληθυντικόν” plural; <hi rend="italic">cf</hi>.
ἑνικῶς, <hi rend="italic">De Dec.</hi> 43. See further App. p. 635.</note>

have φθάνωσι, which (or φθῶσι) gives the better sense.</note>



<note n="7.533.a">The dictionaries do not suggest this meaning for αὐτοχειρία and αὐτόχειρ as a variant to the ordinary meaning of “with one’s own hand”; but the sense here seems to require such a modification. To suggest that the injured persons would like to do the act almost with their own hands seems feeble. Still more is this the case in § 96.</note>



<note n="7.532.1">So or καθοσιωμένον MSS. S has τῶν καθοσιωμένων,
which Cohn adopts (correcting the ο to ω).</note>




<note n="7.535.a">See Num. xxxv. 16–18, where we have the same enumeration
of weapons (iron, stone, wood), the use of which constitutes
murder, followed later (<hi rend="italic">vv.</hi> 22, 23) by the proviso that if the
death was not caused through enmity, it is not murder, though
this refers rather to accidental than, as Philo seems to construe
it, to unpremeditated slaying He resumes the subject in
§ 104. At present his point is that poisoning cannot possibly
have such an excuse.</note>


<note n="7.535.b">Philo’s main authority for these two sections is Ex. xxii. 18,
where, while the A.V. has “thou shalt not suffer a witch (R.V. “sorceress”) to live,” the LXX has φαρμακοὺς οὐ περιποιήσεις. The word φαρμακός is applied to sorcerers as well as poisoners, as Philo himself implies in § 102, where see note.</note>


<note n="7.535.c">Or possibly “deadly,” as in § 106.</note>


<note n="7.535.d">Does this suggest that Philo had an inkling or had been informed that the Hebrew word which the LXX translated by φαρμακούς was actually feminine?</note>




<note n="7.537.a">Goodenough, who translates this passage, p. 105, gives
the meaning more literally, “suffer in the libation something
which should have no connexion with it.” But the idea of
“truce,” is inextricably bound up with “libation” in σπονδή
and still more in ἄσπονδος.</note>

<note n="7.539.b">Or “made a partner with,” i.e. “has learnt their lore.”
But this would seem to need the dative. The genitive, at any rate in Philo, is regularly applied to the thing shared.</note>


<note n="7.539.c">For the use of κακοτεχνία see note on <hi rend="italic">De Mut.</hi> 151.</note>



<note n="7.541.a">Philo here clearly implies that he sees that the magical arts described in the previous section fall under the head of the crime denounced in Ex. xxii. 18 φαρμακοὺς οὐ περιποιήσεις.</note>


<note n="7.541.b">Philo finds this meaning in οὐ περιποιήσεις. The verb might properly be used of a person temporarily reprieved.</note>


<note n="7.541.c">Lit. “to make the best of their opportunities since they are about to die,” if the text is to stand, on which see App. pp. 636–637. Cohn’s first suggestion of are ἅτε θανατοῦντας, meaning, I suppose, “since they are murderous people,” seems to me impossibly weak.</note>



<note n="7.540.1">Cohn, who originally suggested ἅτε θανατοῦντας, later in a
note to Heinemann’s translation declared the words to be an
interpolation. See note <hi rend="italic">c</hi> and App. pp. 636–637.</note>


<note n="7.540.2">So Cohn following Mangey for MSS. πηγήν. I follow
them without doubt. Is λογικὴ πηγή in the sense of the
“fountain of reason,” i.e. containing reason, as a periphrasis
for the mind or soul, impossible?</note>




<note n="7.543.a">For §§ 105–107 see Ex. xxi. 18, 19. Observe that Philo
does not really follow up the idea suggested in the preceding
section and still more clearly in § 92, viz. that manslaughter
committed in sudden anger is only a “half action,” and presumably,
therefore, to be punished less severely. For if the
other dies on the spot the penalty is still death, and if he dies
later, the remission of the penalty is only justified by the uncertainty that the death was due to the blow. See on § 120 (App. pp. 637–638).</note>


<note n="7.543.b">E.V. “only he shall pay for the loss of his time and shall cause him to be thoroughly healed.” Philo follows closely the wording of the LXX, πλὴν τῆς ἀργίας αὐτοῦ ἀποτίσει καὶ τὰ ἰατρεῖα.</note>



<note n="7.545.a">Ex. xxi. 22. Here Philo follows the LXX, which differs
seriously from the Hebrew. There the words “so that her
fruit depart, and yet no mischief follow,” appear to mean
(see Driver) that the woman does not die or suffer permanent
injury from the miscarriage, and the question of the complete
formation or not of the child does not appear at all. LXX,

<note n="7.557.a">The first reason for the choice of the Levitical cities was
that their history shewed that homicide was not necessarily a
crime. The second was that their superior sanctity made
them a more secure refuge.</note>



<note n="7.559.a">Philo’s explanations in §§ 131–136 of “till the death of
the high priest” are (1) that the high priest, as representing
the nation, is bound to inflict the punishment which the fugitive incurs by leaving his refuge; (2) that he is a theoretically perfect character and will therefore refuse to tolerate the presence of even the involuntary offender. In the first case the φυγή is regarded as a refuge, in the second as exile (as in § 123). See further App. p. 638.</note>



<note n="7.558.1">MSS. τὰ μέρη.</note>



<note n="7.561.a">While the second explanation has something in common
with the allegorical interpretation in <hi rend="italic">De Fuga</hi> 108 f., it is
difficult to see why as it stands it is more suitable for older
ears than the other. Perhaps the idea is that it involves the
theological and somewhat mystical distinction between voluntary
and involuntary sins on which Philo often dwells in his
allegorical disquisitions, <hi rend="italic">cf. e.g. De Ebr.</hi> 125.</note>


<note n="7.561.b">Cohn’s rejection of οὐχ, though accepted by Heinemann, seems to me unreasonable, ἐναγεῖς is a strong word, and to negative it perfectly agrees with the description of unintentional homicide as a pollution of little note (§ 121). Apart from this, ἀλλά does not suit the parallelism, which Cohn’s text demands, between ἐναγεῖς and οὐ καθαρούς.</note>



<note n="7.560.1">Cohn expunged the οὐχ, quite wrongly, I think; see
note <hi rend="italic">b.</hi></note>



<note n="7.563.a">Presumably these are non-Israelites, <hi rend="italic">cf</hi>. ii. 123. For the sentiments expressed <hi rend="italic">cf</hi>. ii. 69. For the following sections see Ex. xxi. 20, 21.</note>



<note n="7.562.1">So MSS.: Cohn corrects to αὕτη. In view of the common
conjunction between αὐτός and the reflexive, I think the MSS.
reading is preferable.</note>


<note n="7.562.2">MSS. heading Κατὰ τῶν οἰκέτας κτεινόντων.</note>




<note n="7.565.a">The thought of justice as the adversary and the legal
process described in the next section probably spring from a
misunderstanding of Ex. xxi. 20. There, where the E.V. has
“he shall surely be punished,” the LXX has δίκῃ ἐκδικηθήσεται.
Philo, misunderstanding, as often, the Hebrew idiomatic way
of strengthening the verb, takes this to mean “he shall be
condemned by justice.” He also interprets this to imply the
death-penalty, though the text points rather to a fine (see
Driver, <hi rend="italic">ad loc.</hi>).</note>


<note n="7.565.b">Ex. xxi. 21, “Notwithstanding if he continue (LXX διαβιώσῃ, “survive”) a day or two, he shall not be punished; for he is his money.” Philo understands the first part of this to mean that the master will be acquitted on the grounds that if he had intended to kill the slave he would have done so at once. The last words, “for he is his money,” which probably mean that the master will not be fined, as he anyhow loses his property, are construed as a plea that he cannot have intended to destroy a valuable possession. Philo fails to observe that the plea would have been equally applicable if the slave had died on the spot.</note>



<note n="7.567.a">For §§ 144–146 see Ex. xxi. 28–32 and 35, 36.</note>


<note n="7.567.b">The stoning is probably to avoid contact, cf. Ex. xix. 13,
“no hand shall touch him but he shall surely be stoned or shot through “(with a dart). Philo seems to understand it that any animal killed in the ordinary way is suitable for sacrifice.</note>


<note n="7.567.c">So E.V. “hath not kept him in.” The lxx has ἀφανίσῃ αὐτόν = “removed” or “kept him out of the way.” Heinemann
notes that here Philo is nearer to the Hebrew than to the LXX. But this may be merely accidental. His interpretation of ἀφανίσῃ is a very natural one.</note>



<note n="7.566.1">MS. heading Κατὰ ζῴων ἀλόγων ἃ παραίτια γίγνεται θανάτου.</note>



<note n="7.569.a">Ex. xxi. 36, “pay bull for bull.” Philo, I think, rightly
interprets this to pay compensation enough to buy another
bull (or whatever the animal killed is), not as Goodenough,
to hand over his own (and vicious) bull to the other. The
words expunged by Cohn (see note 1), “because having
foreknowledge of the savageness of his own animal he has
not taken precautions; and if it kills the beast of another,
he must pay the like as compensation,” are absurdly superfluous. Cohn (<hi rend="italic">Hermes</hi>, 1908, p. 206) also considers that the Greek has faults of which Philo would not have been guilty.</note>


<note n="7.569.b">Philo passes over the case (<hi rend="italic">v</hi>. 36) where the bull has not been known to be vicious, when the two owners divide the loss between them.</note>


<note n="7.569.c">For §§ 147–148 see Ex. xxi. 33, 34, which, however, legislates for cases where death is thus caused to an animal, not to a man. See App. p. 638.</note>


<note n="7.569.d">Deut. xxii. 8, where, though no penalty is prescribed, it is implied that the omission will constitute bloodguiltiness (LXX ποιήσεις φόνον). See App. pp. 638–639.</note>



<note n="7.568.1">The words in brackets only appear in two MSS. See
note <hi rend="italic">a.</hi></note>


<note n="7.568.2">MSS. heading Περὶ ὀρυγμάτων.</note>




<note n="7.571.a">Num. xxxv. 31, 32. In the second of these verses, where
the E.V. has “ye shall take no ransom for him that is fled to
his city of refuge, that he should come again to dwell in
the land until the death of the priest,” the LXX has οὐ
λήψεσθε λύτρα τοῦ φυγεῖν εἰς πόλιν κτλ., which might easily be
wrongly taken to mean “ye shall not accept a ransom so
that he shall fly.” Philo’s phrase in “substitute banishment
for death” suggests that he did take it so, meaning presumably
that the voluntary homicide might purchase a leave to
use the city of refuge.</note>


<note n="7.571.b"><hi rend="italic">Ibid. v.</hi> 33 “the land shall not be purged from the blood shed upon it but by the blood of him that shed it.”</note>


<note n="7.571.c">Or simply “hanged up.” But in the other two places where Philo uses the word, <hi rend="italic">De Post</hi>. 61 and <hi rend="italic">De Som</hi>. ii. 213, it is definitely coupled with nailing, and he probably understood the κρεμάσητε ἐπὶ ξύλου of the LXX to mean “affix to something wooden,” as also did Paul in Gal. iii. 13. Probably he understood that it is only the corpse of the malefactor which is so affixed, though he does not make it absolutely clear.</note>


<note n="7.571.d">Deut. xxi. 22, 23. Philo treats the text very freely. It does not enjoin the “hanging,” but merely that if it is done, the body shall be buried the same day. Nor is it specified that it is a punishment for murderers in particular.</note>




<note n="7.573.a">Deut. xxiv. 16.</note>




<note n="7.574.1">MSS. μηδενὸς.</note>




<note n="7.579.a">τῶν ἀδικωτάτων depends on ὅροι καὶ κανόνες understood.</note>


<note n="7.579.b">Heinemann impossibly translates “die fünf nächsten Verwandten ihres Hauses.” For the law see App. pp. 639–640.</note>


<note n="7.579.c">The translation is based, as stated in note 1, on the conjecture that σκοπεῖν is to be omitted. Though the idea of the passage is fantastic, the general meaning seems clear, however uncertain the details of the text.</note>


<note n="7.579.d">I understand τὸ μέν “as having bad,” τὸ δέ “as having good” relations.</note>



<note n="7.578.1">The text here is very difficult I have not altered the
form printed by Cohn, who, as also Mangey, supposed a
lacuna after προφυλακὴν, but I doubt whether the error lies
here. Something like τὸν διάγοντα ἐν ἀσφαλεῖ βίῳ is required
as subject to παθεῖν, for the legislator is not supposed to be
guarding against his own ruin, but that of his relations. If
σκοπεῖν is omitted, or some other infinitive = ἁλῶναι dependent
on κινδυνευόντων substituted, and μὴ inserted before ἐξετάζεσθαι,
the sentence, though very awkward, will be translatable.
In that case ἐξετάζεσθαι is co-ordinate with παθεῖν and the sense
as given in the translation. Heinemann, accepting the lacuna,
suggested filling it by δεινὸν γὰρ. <hi rend="italic">i, e.</hi> “it would be terrible
to see the safe man in such a plight,” but this, I think, would
require ἐξεταζόμενον.</note>



<note n="7.581.a">At this point Philo, having hitherto discussed actions
which lead, or are intended to lead, to the loss of human life,
turns to the question of assaults which do not necessarily have,
nor are intended to have, that result. That these should be included
under his seventh commandment is perfectly rational,
and indeed he has stated this in <hi rend="italic">De Dec.</hi> 170. They may involve other matters. Thus the law discussed in the next twelve sections, though it gives rise to a disquisition on female modesty, is primarily directed against an assault, just as the “eye for eye” of § 184 is preceded by the discussion of equal punishment in §§ 181 f.</note>



<note n="7.580.1">MS. heading Περὶ τοῦ μὴ ἀναισχυντεῖν γυναῖκας.</note>




<note n="7.583.a">There was of course no Jewish temple in Alexandria.
Philo may mean the synagogue, but surely no sacrifice could
be offered there. It seems to me more probable that he is
giving advice to the female population in general and does not
feel any necessity to speak disrespectfully of their religious
observances. But see App. p. 640.</note>


<note n="7.583.b">Lit. “a citizeness,” carrying with it something of the idea of ἀστεῖος. <hi rend="italic">Cf</hi>. ἀσταί, <hi rend="italic">De Mig</hi>. 99. also <hi rend="italic">De Cong</hi>. 63.</note>



<note n="7.585.a">Deut. xxv. 11, 12. Philo appears at first sight to give approval to this law, and if he realizes that it is open to the same objections as he made to a similar enactment in ii. 244, he does not say so. Still one may perhaps see some hesitation. The phrase ἔστω δ᾿ ἡ δίκη may not mean more than that the law says so. In § 178 of the literal explanation he merely says that is what is commonly given, not that it is true, and his preference for the allegorical is not disguised.</note>


<note n="7.585.b">So Deuteronomy, “Thine eye shall have no pity.”</note>



<note n="7.584.1">Cohn brackets γυναῖκες, or would transfer it to after προβαίνουσι.

leaves the discussion of acts of violence and recurs to murder

<note n="7.603.c">If εὐθύς is retained in its present position, it should mean they are not straight away (i<hi rend="italic">.e.</hi> necessarily) clean, as might be expected since what they have done is natural and innocent. This is very strained. The sense to be expected is that they are <hi rend="italic">ipso facto</hi> unclean, but this would be rather εὐθὺς μή.

<note n="7.605.a">Philo’s account differs from Numbers in that he implies
that, except to get admission to the temple, a purification at the time is enough, and the man is then “fully cleansed.”
In Numbers everyone who touches the corpse is impure for seven days and requires the purging on the third and seventh. The exclusion from the temple only appears (<hi rend="italic">vv.</hi> 13 and 20), in the words “whosoever . . . purifieth not himself defileth the tabernacle of the Lord.”</note>

<note n="8.7.b">In the phrase ἄγειν καὶ φέρειν, ἄγειν, according to the lexicon, applies properly to animals, φέρειν to other property. But the phrase seems to have become almost proverbial to cover any kind of misappropriation.</note>


<note n="8.7.c">For the kind of punishment which this term implies see §23.</note>



<note n="8.9.a">Philo could hardly have justified this from Ex. xxii.,
unless perhaps he argues that the permission to kill the
housebreaker shows that the law took a severer view of
violence. For analogies in Roman and other law see App.
p. 425.</note>


<note n="8.9.b">This I think must be the meaning, though it gives the
phrase a somewhat different sense from what it bears in § 7.
Heinemann has merely “veils his crime in shame”; Goodenough
“making a veil of shame for his sin.”</note>


<note n="8.9.c">Ex. xxii. 4. LXX “if the thing stolen be left and found in his hand, from an ass to a sheep alive, he shall repay them double.” Philo’s generalization is supported by <hi rend="italic">v.</hi> 7, where it says of goods stolen from a neighbour to whom they have been given to keep “if the thief is found, he shall repay double.” So also <hi rend="italic">v.</hi> 9. See also App. p. 425.</note>


<note n="8.9.d">Ex. xxii. 3, though this properly applies to the housebreaker.</note>


<note n="8.9.e">Heinemann translates “at the beginning of the seventh
 year,” which will make better sense if ἐντός can mean this,
I have understood it to mean that he is to be released at the sabbatical year, whether he has served a full six or not. But this involves a contradiction of Ex. xxi. 2, and of Philo’s own statement in <hi rend="italic">Spec. Leg.</hi> ii. 122, where liberation independent of the time served only applies to the Jubile, not to the sabbatical year.</note>



<note n="8.8.1">So Heinemann. Mangey &lt;καὶ&gt; τὸ σκότος. Cohn &lt;δι᾿&gt;
αἰδῶ. As the thief does not necessarily steal in the dark, τὸ
σκότος is absurd, and the insertion may be easily accounted
for from § 7. As it is here printed, the phrase, as Heinemann
points out, is exactly the same as <hi rend="italic">Spec. Leg.</hi> iii. 54,
of the guilty wife who confesses her sin and thus avoids the
culminating guilt of ἀναισχυντία.</note>



<note n="8.11.a">See <hi rend="italic">Spec. Leg.</hi> ii. 122. The general proclamation apparently refers to that mentioned in Lev. xxv. 10, though that also applies only to the year of Jubile, and not to the ordinary sabbatical year. But see App. p. 426.</note>

πρὸς διορύγματι τειχίου and understands it to mean “even

also Philo by his αὐτῷ. On the exact meaning of διόρυγμα

LXX has “he shall repay from his field according to its produce,”
a vague expression which might mean (or Philo might
take it to mean) either that he made compensation with a
piece of land or with the fruits. Heinemann, supposing that
Philo meant the former, adopted Cohn’s suggestion of τμῆμα “a slice” for κτῆμα. κτήματα (plural) = landed possessions, <hi rend="italic">De Virt.</hi> 90, 100, and elsewhere, but κτῆμα (singular) is a strange word for a piece of land.

This no doubt gives a rather strained meaning to τῶν μὴ

<note n="8.29.e">For this section see Ex. xxii. 9–13. Philo’s explanation is
a simplification of what, particularly in the LXX, is a confusing
passage. In <hi rend="italic">v.</hi> 9 it is stated that in the case of any
loss, animals included, the disputants will appear “before
God” and the person convicted will pay compensation.
The verse, which may be out of place, does not seem to
refer particularly to depostit, but coming where it does,
Philo would naturally conclude that it did so refer, and sup- pose that it means that the oath, unless shown to be false, would clear the depositary. Verses 10–12 state that if an animal deposited in trust has been wounded or dies or has been carried away captive, “and no one knows it,” the oath will clear him, but adds that if it is stolen, the depositary must make it good. Verse 13 says that if it has been torn by wild beasts, he must take the owner to the fragments of the corpse (ἄξει ἐπὶ τὴν θήραν) and so clear himself. Philo ignores the difficulty in <hi rend="italic">v</hi>. 12, “if it has been stolen he shall pay compensation,” and falls back upon the general principle that the oath is to be trusted. Also from the statement that the fragments of the torn animal are sufficient evidence, he seems to argue that the same must hold good of any dead animal if the owner is accessible, and that therefore the oath in this case is not needed.</note>



<note n="8.31.a">For this section see Ex. xxii. 14, 15. LXX “If anyone ask
from his neighbour and it is wounded (or broken) or die or
is carried away captive, and the owner is not with it, he
shall make compensation. But if the owner is with it, he
shall not make compensation.” Philo interprets the request
(or borrowing) to apply to other things besides animals, and “carried away captive” (αἰχμάλωτον γένηται) to include stealing, and “be with it,” which presumably means that he is present when the mishap occurs, to mean as above, “be accessible.” The last half of the verse, which is very obscure, he leaves alone.</note>


<note n="8.31.b">Lit. “both,” meaning that both are liable to be stolen, but not to die.</note>


<note n="8.31.c">Heinemann “thrown aside.” Mangey “temere proiecisse.”
The meaning given above, which is a quite common use of παραρρίπτω, seems to me more suitable to the context.</note>



<note n="8.30.1">The ungrammatical εἰ τὰ with the subjunctive, which
Cohn brackets, would easily slip in after ἔπειτα. Mangey
retaining it has κλαπείη and ἀποθάνοι without MS. authority.
Wendland suggested ἢ τὰ with fair probability. Stephanus
states that ἀμφότερα preceded by the article is only found in
N.T. and later writers. But see ταῖς ἀμφοτέραις, § 129.</note>



<note n="8.33.a">Or simply as Heinemann and Mangey, “what is about
to be said,” or “has to be said.” The translation given
above is based on a feeling that as τῶν μελλόντων so taken is somewhat pointless, Philo may be carrying on the thought of the previous sentence that each clause is the precursor of the next and leads up to it as its natural consequence. See App. p. 427.</note>

<note n="8.32.3">This heading stands on quite a different footing from
the rest, as the allusion to it in τουτὶ below shows it to be indispensable.
Possibly it should be printed in line with ἔνατον
rather than as a heading.</note>



<note n="8.35.a">As this only applies to consenting to injustice many
examples no doubt could be found, e.g. Ex. xxxiii. 7 “thou
shalt keep away from every unjust word,” Lev. xix. 15, Deut.
xvi. 19, 20. The further thought that consenting to an
injustice involves supporting what we know to be false and
therefore is a breach of the ninth commandment has its
source in Ex. xxiii. 1, 2, where “thou shalt not join with the unjust to be an unjust witness,” is followed at once by “thou shalt not be with a multitude for evil.” This last is evidently the text expounded in the next sentence.</note>

<note n="8.39.a">Or “makes sounds on,” “raises sounds from” it, i.e. the
vocal organism. This must be the sense if τε is retained,
though to understand the dative from the preceding accusative
seems awkward. Mangey translates “formante,” and
I presume Heinemann means much the same by “bright den ganzen Stimmapparat zum Schallen und Tönen,” but I do not see how the word can mean this. For Philo’s regular use of ἐνηχεῖν to express reiteration and insistence in speech see note on <hi rend="italic">De Mut.</hi> 57 (vol. v. p. 588). For the sense of this sentence cf. i. 65, <hi rend="italic">Quis Rerum</hi> 266. Heinemann compares Plato, <hi rend="italic">Ion</hi> 534. See App. p. 429.</note>


<note n="8.39.b">The word ψευδοπροφήτης is not used of diviners in the Pentateuch nor indeed used at all. It is however found elsewhere in the LXX, and is associated with divination, Jer. xxxiv. (E.V. xxvii.) 9, xxxvi. (E.V. xxix.) 8.</note>

arguments (see <hi rend="italic">Hermes</hi>, 1908, p. 208) do not seem to me
very conclusive. They are (1) the words cannot be explained
grammatically, for it is not clear to what ἀναφαίνοντι refers.
(It surely agrees with ἡλίῳ, and the construction, though
very awkward, is not ungrammatical.) (2) ὁλοστός is only
known from a gloss of Hesychius. (Mangey’s proposal of
ὅλως αὐτὸν or αὑτὸν (?) might overcome this.) (3) The hiatus
καθαρᾷ ὁλοστὸν is intolerable. (On this see note in App. to
§ 40.) My own further difficulty is that I do not see the
meaning of ὡς. But altogether the clause, though certainly open to suspicion, does not seem to me impossible. On ὁλοστός see further App. p. 430.</note>

combined with οὖς would mean “to lend an ear.” The same may be said of Mangey’s “ex aurium iudicio pendeant.” I understand it to mean that the idle talk they listen to serves as a fence to exclude other advice. Philo has several times used ἐπιφράττειν ὦτα for blocking or closing the ears from hearing something, <hi rend="italic">e.g. De Mig.</hi> 191.

<note n="8.75.a">That πολύχηλα is not a mere casual addition is shown by
the interpretation given of it in the next words. But there
is no foundation for it in Leviticus or Deuteronomy, nor in
Philo’s discussion of διχηλεῖν in <hi rend="italic">De Agr</hi>. Nor am I clear what
zoologically it means (“many-toed”?). Heinemann translates
“Vielhufer”; Mangey “quae plures ungulas habent.”
All I can suggest is that Philo supposes that, as the stress is laid upon the “two” in διχηλεῖν, if there are animals πολύχηλα. they will be unclean also. See also App. p. 434.</note>

feet.” LXX πᾶς ὁ πορευόμενος ἐπὶ τέσσαρα διὰ παντός, ὃ πολυπληθεῖ
ποσίν, which would naturally mean that the four- legged and the many footed form a single class, and so Philo treats them in the interpretation that follows. The slaves of the four main passions are also slaves to the many specific passions into which these four are subdivided. For the same interpretation of the “four-legged” <hi rend="italic">cf. Leg. All.</hi> iii. 139.</note>

<note n="8.79.b">Or “straight”; the creatures have to straighten their legs
to leap. κανών is perhaps used in its original sense of a ruler
to keep lines straight, in which sense it is often associated with ὀρθός. Cf. <hi rend="italic">De Fug.</hi> 152 παιδείας κανὼν ὀρθῆς, preceded (§ 150) by ὀρθὴν καὶ ἀκλινῆ παιδείαν.</note>


<note n="8.79.c">Lev. xi. 13 ff., Deut. xiv. 12 ff. The “clean” species are not mentioned. See App. p. 434.</note>



<note n="8.78.1">Cohn places the comma after ὀρθῆς.</note>


<note n="8.78.2">Cohn suggests ἀλόγων, and so probably Heinemann who
translates “Tieren.”</note>



<note n="8.81.a">Or perhaps “take for food,” and so Heinemann
“geniessen,” Mangey “edere.” But the word does not
itself carry this sense, though Philo assumes in the sequel
that such bodies would only be touched in order to use them
as food. He uses the vaguer word, I think, because the
LXX in Lev. v. 2, differing from the Hebrew, forbids or might
be understood to forbid touching such bodies, ἐὰν ἅψηται
παντὸς πράγματος ἀκαθάρτου, ἢ θνησιμαίου ἢ θηριαλώτου ἀκαθάρτου.
Eating θνησιμαῖα is forbidden in Deut. xiv. 21, θηριάλωτα
in Ex. xxii. 31, and both in Lev. xxii. 8 (not mentioned by
Cohn or Heinemann).</note>


<note n="8.81.b">If this is right (and κοινωνικούς below suggests that they keep some for themselves), it is a use of διανέμειν for which I can find no authority. The wording would be more natural if was omitted, but even then σύν is strange. The κοινωκικόν so praised lies in giving them to the huntsmen, and it is this which Philo thinks undesirable. “They distribute pieces to the huntsmen as well as to the dogs” is the sense required.</note>



<note n="8.80.1">MSS. ἀνθρώπων.</note>



<note n="8.83.a">Or perhars “would probably blame them.” Heinemann “has rightly blamed them,” which apart from the inaccuracy gives, I believe, a wrong sense. Philo does not speak dogmatically, but thinks that what he urges here may be fairly inferred from the prohibitions mentioned above. Indeed how could the seven species of “clean” game (§ 105) be obtained except by hunting?</note>


<note n="8.83.b">Or, as Heinemann and Mangey, “if a practiser (of virtue) should become a lover of gymnastics and hunting.” The version given above (taking καί = “also”) is based on the belief that ἀσκητής is not used absolutely in this way. It means “a practiser” and a practiser of what is indicated by the context, and that the body rather than virtue is being practised is indicated by φιλογυμναστής. Hunting is a special form of bodily exercise and while the φιλόθηρος must be a φιλογυμναστής the converse is not necessarily the case. For the motive here ascribed <hi rend="italic">cf. De Ios.</hi> 3 and <hi rend="italic">Mos.</hi> i. 60.</note>



<note n="8.82.1">Some insertion is required, but κατὰ after ἄδικον would
serve equally well and be perhaps easier. See also note 3.</note>


<note n="8.82.2">Of the two MSS. available here one omits πεῖραν, possibly
rightly. πεῖρα does not seem to be used like the English
“experience” for something suffered, though it may be used
in such phrases as πεῖραν λαμβάνειν = “to gain experience <hi rend="italic">in.</hi>”
To omit it involves taking δἰ ὧν of causes in the past, and
δι᾿ ἃ of prospects in the future, but this, I think, could be
paralleled from Philo.</note>


<note n="8.82.3">So MSS. Cohn corrects to ἀμυνομένους. But the accusative
and dative are both used to express the agent of the
verbal in -τέον. See Goodwin, <hi rend="italic">Moods and Tenses</hi>, p. 369,
where the dative is said to be the commoner of the two.
The same rule will apply to the insertion of μιμουμένοις
above, where Cohn prints -ους.</note>



<note n="8.85.a">Heinemann apparently takes ἄγχοντες καὶ ἀποπνίγοντες as
governing τὴν οὐσίαν τῆς ψυχῆς. (καί = “even.”) But the
essence of the soul is clearly the blood and this is not strangled.
I understand the participles to govern ζῷα, understood out of
ἄθυτα. Strangling is not forbidden in so many words, but
cf. Acts xv. 29 ἀπέχεσθαι . . . αἵματος καὶ πνικτῶν.</note>


<note n="8.85.b">See Lev. xvii. 11 and 14. LXX ἡ γὰρ ψυχὴ πάσης σαρκὸς αἷμα αὐτοῦ ἐστι. <hi rend="italic">Cf.</hi> Deut. xii. 23.</note>

The LXX ἐπέβαλεν does not bring this out so clearly and Philo
seems to suppose that the whole of their flight was at this
height.</note>


<note n="8.89.b">Cohn and Mangey’s readings (see note 2) evidently
mean that having been bred in piety they would have
abstained. I greatly prefer the more forcible reading of the
LXX, which is by no means an absurd exaggeration. A
state of great religious excitement does produce an independence
of food. Compare the description in <hi rend="italic">De Vit. Cont.</hi> 35
of the Therapeutae who “feasting on the rich banquet of
doctrines” abstained from food for three or even six days.</note>


<note n="8.89.c">If this is right, it is an odd extension of the cognate accusative; otherwise “dressing every kind (of quail).” But there is no reason to suppose that there were different kinds of quails. In the E.V. the quails are “spread abroad,” i.e. cured by drying in the sun, which is rendered in the LXX by ἔψυξαν ἑαυτοῖς ψυγμούς “they dried for themselves dryings,” a phrase which may have puzzled Philo. Heinemann and Mangey ignore ἰδέαν.</note>


<note n="8.89.d"><hi rend="italic">cf. v.</hi> 20. E.V. “until it come out at your nostrils, and it be loathsome unto you.” Here the LXX for “loathsome” has εἰς χολέραν = “nausea.” But “discharges of bile” would be a possible equivalent, and probably the idea was assisted by “come out at your nostrils.”</note>

<note n="8.88.3">MSS. ἐξιέσαν.</note>



<note n="8.91.a">Deut. xii. 8. For παραινέσεις as a name for Deuteronomy
= the more usual προτρεπτικοί (<hi rend="italic">sc.</hi> λόγοι), <hi rend="italic">cf. De Agr.</hi> 84.</note>


<note n="8.91.b">Not (as Heinemann) some laws, but the virtues, as ταῦτα
below shows.</note>


<note n="8.91.c">Here as in ii. 63, where see note, I see no reason to
depart from the established rule that ὡς ἔπος εἰπεῖν does not introduce a metaphor but a general or rough statement, particularly of numbers. “One or two” are examples; any law might conceivably fit in to three or four or any other number short of ten. Heinemann here as there translates “so zu sagen,” but unless the phrase connotes something different from the English “so to speak,” I can see no point in it.</note>



<note n="8.90.1">My correction for ὑποστέλλων τὰ (which Cohn retains).
The change from ὑποστέλλοντα intransitive verb to transitive
verb seems unnatural and awkward.</note>



<note n="8.93.a">i.e. §§ 55–78.</note>


<note n="8.93.b">Deut. vi. 6, 8 (also xi. 18). E.V. “These words, which I
command thee this day, shall be upon thy heart . . . and
thou shalt bind them for a sign upon thy hand, and for
frontlets between thine eyes.” In both places the word
translated “frontlets” (whence the (head) phylacteries of Matt, xxiii. 5) is given in the LXX by ἀσάλευτον “unshaken.” The sequel shows that Philo read σαλευτόν. See App. p. 435. Actually these words prescribe obedience to God’s law, and so belong rather to εὐσέβεια. Heinemann suggests that the description of them as δικαιώματα in <hi rend="italic">v.</hi> 3 may have led him to dwell upon them here. Perhaps it is enough to say that as the Deuteronomic code, which he mostly quotes in the sequel, is largely concerned with δικαιοσύνη, they may be fairly quoted here, though they have other applications also.</note>



<note n="8.92.1">The MSS. here have the heading Περὶ δικαιοσύνης, and
Cohn begins a fresh numeration of chapters. Though the
insertion of a heading would otherwise be justified by the
important break at this point, it is unnecessary in view of
the concluding words of the last section.</note>




<note n="8.94.1">MSS. ἀναθημάτων. In the words that follow καὶ ταῦτα is
Cohn’s correction for ταῦτα καὶ of S (καὶ omitted in M). I
think of the four corrections made by Cohn in this sentence
μαθημάτων and ἐντυποῦν should stand, but thus corrected the
text of M is satisfactory, i.e. ἀλλὰ τῷ ἡγεμονικωτάτῳ πάντων
ἄριστα μαθημάτων ἐντυποῦν ταῦτα, χαράττοντα κτλ.</note>


<note n="8.94.2">MSS. μηδένος.</note>


<note n="8.94.3">Mangey’s text here, σάλον δ᾿ ἐχέτω ταῦτα κινούμενον, φησίν, οὐχ ἵν᾿ ἀβέβαιον καὶ ἀνίδρυτον, ἀλλ᾿ ἵνα κτλ., is with a few slight variations the text of the MSS. but the neuter singulars are ungrammatical.</note>


<note n="8.94.4">MSS. μὲν.</note>



<note n="8.97.a">Deut. vi. 7 (xi. 19) “thou shalt teach them to thy sons, and shalt talk of them, sitting in the house, and walking in the way and lying down and rising up.”</note>


<note n="8.97.b">Deut. vi. 9 “And ye shall write them on the doorposts of your houses and your gates.”</note>



<note n="8.96.1">MSS. φίλων.</note>


<note n="8.96.2">Or should we read ἐπιδημοῦντες “returning home”corresponding
to εἰσιόντες and ἐξιόντες below? It is when they
pass in and out that they would see the inscriptions on the gate.</note>


<note n="8.96.3">Perhaps, as Mangey suggests, ὁρῶσιν.</note>



<note n="8.99.a">Deut. iv. 2, xii. 32 “ye shall not add to the word which
I command you, and ye shall not take from it” (E.V.
“diminish”).</note>


<note n="8.99.b">Or “finality.”</note>

<note n="8.98.3">MSS. ἀφαιρήσει.</note>




<note n="8.101.a">Deut. xix. 14. It is difficult to see why this passage is
introduced here. The text is clearly quoted not for its literal
meaning, but for its application to the customs which are unwritten laws. But the laws which have been and are still to be discussed are not unwritten.</note>



<note n="8.103.a">See App. p. 435.</note>


<note n="8.103.b">Or perhaps better “a random act of fortune.” Fortune’s steps are uncertain, but not always blunders. “Freak” might perhaps cover the meaning. <hi rend="italic">Cf.</hi> ii. 231 (of the same subject).</note>


<note n="8.103.c">Or “home-made,” “ man-made.”</note>



<note n="8.102.1">Here the MSS. have the heading Κατάστασις ἄρχοντων
(“De constitutione principum”). The title is not only unnecessary but misleading. As no further heading is given it
may be supposed to cover the rest of the treatise, but the
appointment of the ruler only occupies the sections down to
§ 159, and his character and duties only to § 192. Cohn
however begins here a fresh numeration of chapters.</note>


<note n="8.102.2">MSS. ἔτι νῦν or οὐ τοίνυν.</note>




<note n="8.105.a">ἵνα, as often in Philo, is consecutive.</note>


<note n="8.105.b">Lit. “the land-nature is able to pass through navigable
nature.” See <hi rend="italic">Spec. Leg.</hi> i. 335 and note.</note>


<note n="8.105.c">Deut. xvii. 15 “thou shalt surely set over thyself a ruler, whomsoever the Lord thy God shall choose. From thy brethren thou shalt set a ruler over thyself. Thou shalt not be able to set over thyself a man that is a stranger, because he is not thy brother.”</note>



<note n="8.107.a">The words are obscure. If the text is right, the meaning
may be that the choice of one particular man shows him to
be the “eye of the body,” and that God accepts this and
confirms it. Philo is clearly trying to reconcile the free
choice which he thinks is implied in the words “thou shalt
set” with the limitation “whomsoever the Lord thy God
Shall choose.” But no authority is quoted for the use of
ἐκλογή = “the chosen,” nor yet for “the choicest” or the
“pick,” which Cohn’s correction of ἄνθρωπον to αἱρεθέντα
demands.</note>


<note n="8.107.b">Deut. xvii. 16, 17. E.V. “only he shall not multiply horses to himself . . . neither shall he greatly multiply to himself silver and gold.” This is not a reason for not choosing a foreigner, but conditions to be observed by the native king. The LXX however has “because he shall not multiply,” etc., and this Philo follows.</note>


<note n="8.107.c">Deut. xvii. 17 (2nd half) “he shall not turn away (E.V. cause to return) the people to Egypt, that he may not multiply horses to himself.” According to the commentators the meaning is that he should not seek alliance with Egypt and so procure a strong force of horses. Philo, perhaps thinking of Egypt as the natural refuge of the exiles from Palestine, takes it to mean expatriation in general, which the foreign king would practise in order to confiscate the people’s wealth. The passage is allegorized in <hi rend="italic">De Agr.</hi> 84 ff. See App. p. 435.</note>



<note n="8.106.1">Cohn suggested αἱρεθέντα, which Heinemann translates.
See note <hi rend="italic">a.</hi></note>


<note n="8.106.2">A doubtful insertion. πλάνον may be cogn. acc.</note>




<note n="8.109.a">Deut. xvii. 18–20. For “sequel” perhaps “appendix.”
E.V. “he shall write him a copy of this book” (more literally “duplicate,” Adam Smith). The LXX has δευτερονόμιον (“repetition of the law”), whence the accepted name. On Ἐπινομίδα see also App. p. 436.</note>


<note n="8.109.b"><hi rend="italic">Ibid.</hi> “he shall read in it all the days of his life.”</note>


<note n="8.109.c">Heinemann translates “thoughts worthy of affection transmitted in writing”; but ἰδέας cannot mean “thoughts.”</note>



<note n="8.111.a">The seven sections which follow are a meditation on
Deut. xvii. 19, 20, the first part of which is put into the
king or ruler’s mouth.</note>


<note n="8.111.b">Verse 19 “to keep all the words of this law and the statutes.”</note>


<note n="8.111.c">Verse 20 “that his heart be not lifted up above his brethren.”</note>


<note n="8.111.d"><hi rend="italic">Ibid,</hi> “that he turn not aside from the commandment, to the right hand or to the left.”</note>



<note n="8.110.1">MSS. ὑπηρέτῃ <hi rend="italic">et al.</hi></note>




<note n="8.113.a">In this section Philo digresses to bring his text into connexion
with Num. xx. 17 (cf. xxi. 22) “We will go along
the king’s high way (LXX ὁδὸς βασιλική), we will not turn
aside to the right hand nor to the left,” on which he has
commented elsewhere, particularly in <hi rend="italic">Quod Deus</hi> 162 ff.
Here the stress is laid on the phrase “royal road,” and the
inference drawn, as I understand it, is that Moses in giving
this name to the central road between (as he says in <hi rend="italic">Quod
Deus</hi>) deficiency and excess suggests that it is the fitting
road for a king. While hitherto he has chiefly followed the
LXX in using ἄρχων, not βασιλεύς, he here shows his perception
that a king is intended (cf. § 164).</note>


<note n="8.113.b"><hi rend="italic">Ibid.</hi> “that he may prolong his days in his rule.” For the spiritual interpretation of the boon of long life promised in the scriptures compare the treatment of the fifth commandment in ii. 262, and <hi rend="italic">Quis Rerum</hi> 290, that the goodly old age promised to Abraham is not the life of long duration, but the life of wisdom.</note>


<note n="8.113.c">For “impervious to bribes” cf. the qualities of the judge, §§ 62 f., and for “gives just judgements justly” §§ 66 f.</note>


<note n="8.113.d">For what follows Philo has no direct pronouncements in the law, but takes the story of Jethro’s advice to Moses in Ex. xviii. described below.</note>




<note n="8.115.a">See Ex. xviii. 21. E.V. “Able men (LXX δυνατούς), such as fear God, men of truth, hating unjust gain” (LXX ὑπερηφανίαν = “arrogance”).</note>



<note n="8.117.a">Dent. x. 17, 18.</note>



<note n="8.116.1">So M. Other MSS. κρίσιν or τάξιν. Cohn prints πρόσταξιν,
but Jethro’s advice could hardly be called this, and the point
is not what he advised, but what Moses did.</note>


<note n="8.116.2">MSS. ἐφαψάμενον or ἐναψάμενον (-ην).</note>



<note n="8.119.a">E.V. “stranger.” LXX προσηλύτῳ. Philo, as regularly elsewhere, assumes that he is a proselyte to Judaism.</note>



<note n="8.118.1">Printed by Cohn ἐπιλέγει—τίσιν ἡ κρίσις;</note>


<note n="8.118.2">Cohn corrects to ὥσπερ. This seems to me not only
unnecessary but to involve a difficult construction, viz. that
εἰς κηδεμονίαν is used like the Latin predicative dative “vir
custodiae est muleri” = “custos mulieris.” Cohn may perhaps
have thought that τοῦτο would be supplied before ὅπερ as in
§ 186.</note>


<note n="8.118.3">MSS. κοινοπραγοῦντα.</note>




<note n="8.121.a">Cf. <hi rend="italic">De Praem.</hi> 166 and note.</note>


<note n="8.121.b">So LXX, Lev. xix. 16. E.V. “Thou shalt not go up and
down as a tale-bearer among thy people.” Both in the Hebrew and in the LXX, it is no doubt a general precept, but as it is preceded by “in righteousness shalt thou judge thy neighbour,” Phiio might allege some reason for applying it to a person in authority.</note>



<note n="8.123.a">“Therefore” is perhaps more logical than the “because” of the MSS. (see note 1). But Philo is not incapable of saying “good rulers are the parents of their subjects and <hi rend="italic">therefore</hi> a ruler must behave as such.”</note>



<note n="8.122.1">So Cohn for MSS. διότι. The correction seems to me
uncertain. See note <hi rend="italic">a</hi>.</note>



<note n="8.125.a">See App. p. 436.</note>


<note n="8.125.b">Σῆμα σῶμα—a well-known play of words, Plato, <hi rend="italic">Cratylus</hi> 400 B, <hi rend="italic">Gorgias</hi> 493 B See App. p. 436.</note>



<note n="8.124.1">Cohn in his footnote and still more strongly in a note to
Heinemann’s translation condemns ποιῆται and suggests
οἴηται or ἡγῆται. But examples of ποιεῖσθαί τι coupled with an adjective or adjectival phrase in the sense of “consider” are fairly common, and though perhaps none quoted are quite analogous to this “considers his apprehension to be dim,” they come near enough to it to forbid dogmatism. On the other hand is οἴεσθαι followed by the adjective, without an expressed infinitive, in ordinary Greek?</note>



<note n="8.127.a">Deut. xvii. 8, 9 “If there arise a matter too hard for thee in judgement . . . thou shalt come unto the priests, the Levites, and unto the judge that shall be in those days.” Philo understands “the judge” to be the high priest. See App. p. 436.</note>


<note n="8.127.b">I understand παραπαίειν to indicate insanity in general, and παραληρεῖν as shown in speech. They may, however, be mere synonyms.</note>


<note n="8.127.c">Here or perhaps at § 188, since the next sections apply to the judge rather than to the ruler, ends all that can fall under the head of “appointment of a ruler,” and the rest of the treatise is taken up with miscellaneous matters of justice.</note>


<note n="8.127.d">See App. p. 437.</note>



<note n="8.126.1">So MSS. except one νηφαλίου. Cohn, who corrects to
νηφαλιόυς here and in i. 100, must have failed to observe, as I
did also there, that νηφάλια θύειν is found in exactly the same
connexion in <hi rend="italic">De Ebr.</hi> 126 and probably <hi rend="italic">ibid.</hi> 140. So also
in <hi rend="italic">De Vit. Cont.</hi> 74 νηφάλια γὰρ ὡς τοῖς ἱερεῦσι θύειν καὶ τούτοις
(i.e. the Therapeutae) βιοῦν ὁ ὀρθὸς λόγος ὑφηγεῖται. See App.
p. 436.</note>




<note n="8.129.a">Lev. xix. 35, 36, Deut. xxv. 13–15.</note>


<note n="8.129.b">I understand this to mean not, as Heinemann, justly earned wealth, which Philo could hardly suppose to be absolutely secure, but the spiritual wealth which the possession of justice entails, <hi rend="italic">cf. e.g. De Virt.</hi> 8.</note>


<note n="8.129.c">Lev. xix. 13, Deut. xxiv. 15.</note>


<note n="8.129.d">“The sun shall not go down upon it,” Deut. <hi rend="italic">l.c.</hi></note>



<note n="8.131.a">Lev. xix. 14. E.V. “thou shalt not curse the deaf.” LXX “thou shalt not speak ill of the deaf.” The sequel shows that Philo understands κωφόν to include dumbness.</note>


<note n="8.131.b"><hi rend="italic">Ibid.</hi> “nor put a stumbling-block before the blind.”</note>


<note n="8.131.c"><hi rend="italic">Cf.</hi> Deut. xxvii. 18 “cursed be he that maketh the blind to wander out of the way.”</note>



<note n="8.130.1">Some MSS. παρ᾿ αὐτὸ τοῦτο = “for this very reason,” i.e. that they are κωφοί. The αὐτὸ τοῦτο alone somewhat strains the use of the cognate accusative.</note>


<note n="8.130.2">Mangey with some MSS. ἔνεδρα = “traps.”</note>




<note n="8.132.1">The punctuation here should be specially noted. All
other editions have φησι τοῖς ἀδικοπραγοῦσι τοὺς μὲν πεπλημμελημένους·
“ὦ κενοὶ φρενῶν,” κτλ. Mangey, Cohn, and
Heinemann all take this punctuation for granted. Mangey
strangely translates “videtur affari insontes laedentibus.”
Cohn pronounced τοὺς μὲν πεπλημμελημένους to be corrupt (see
his discussion in <hi rend="italic">Hermes</hi>, 1908, p. 210). The μὲν, as he says,
has no δὲ or other antithesis, and πεπλημμελημένους, which
he unnecessarily thinks intended to = “the disabled,” cannot
have that meaning. (If however it is taken in the ordinary
sense of “the wronged,” it is merely otiose after ἀδικοπραγοῦσι.)
Accordingly he proposed τοὺς μέρος τι πεπηρωμένους
and Heinemann follows him.
With the changed punctuation all difficulty, I believe, is
removed. τοὺς μὲν πλημμελουμένους is in its right place as an antithesis to τὸν δὲ . . . θεὸν, and the sense is improved, as the tricksters of course are right in thinking that they will go undetected by their victims. I do not think any objection can be raised by the transference of the vocative from the beginning of the clause to a later place. Such a position, if not general, is certainly found, e.g. in i. 320, iii. 66. The general use of ἀδικοπραγεῖν intransitively also supports my view. See App. p. 437.
Between πλημμελουμένους and πεπλημμεληένους the MSS. are divided. I have a very slight preference for the present, as the authors of the outrage are undetected at the time.</note>



<note n="8.135.a"><hi rend="italic">Cf.</hi> ii. 94 f.</note>


<note n="8.135.b">Lev. xix. 19, Deut. xxii. 9–11. Both passages include
the rule of the vineyard and the mixed garment. But in
Leviticus the different species are not to mate, in Deuteronomy
not to plough together. Philo in the main follows Leviticus, but takes account in §§ 205 f. of Deuteronomy, treating it as an illustration. In E.V. Leviticus has “field” of the second injunction, Deuteronomy “vineyard.” But the LXX has “vineyard” in both.</note>


<note n="8.135.c">E.V. “mingled together.” The LXX κίβδηλον, which Philo quotes, probably meant the same, but he could easily read into it the sense of adulterated.</note>


<note n="8.135.d">See iii. 46 ff.</note>



<note n="8.134.1">Some MSS. διάφορον and in § 208. The same variation is
found in the corresponding passages of the MSS. of the MSS.</note>




<note n="8.136.1">MSS. ἀπεργαζόμενον -σόμενον -σάμενον.</note>




<note n="8.139.a">ὕλη is here a collective noun embracing a genus or variety
of trees or vegetation. So below § 229 and i. 74 τῆς ἀγρίας
ὕλης. This sense is not given in L. &amp; S.</note>


<note n="8.139.b">This word is very inadequate as a translation for κόσμος
here, but I doubt whether any equivalent to it exists in
English. It is something higher than mere τάξις, and thus can be used to signify good behaviour and adornment and the perfection of the cosmic system (cf. § 237). Perhaps “harmony” might come nearest to it. Heinemann gives “regularity” and “order” (“Regelmässigkeit“ and “Ordnung”).</note>




<note n="8.141.a">This use of καιρός for a space of time is strange. Possibly he means “with (i.e. for) a small advantage.” See Dictionary.</note>


<note n="8.141.b">See ii. 87–93.</note>



<note n="8.143.a">This double phrase ἐπινεανιευόμενοι καὶ ἐπιχειρονομοῦντος
has been used in <hi rend="italic">Quod Deus</hi> 170, where the translation “with
swaggering air and gestures of pride” suits the contents.
Here any reading that retains the literal sense of “gesticulating”
seems out of place, and the phrase may be regarded as
a familiar expression for “taking pride in.” L. &amp; S. (revised)
refer to this passage and suppose that ἐπιχειρονομοῦντες
means “grasping at.” But this does not fit ταῖς πλεονεξίαις.
ἐπιχειρονομεῖν is not quoted from any other writer.</note>


<note n="8.143.b">Deut. xxii. 9. R.V. “lest the whole fruit be forfeited,
the seed which thou hast sown, and the increase of the vineyard.”
In margin for “forfeited,” Heb. “consecrated.” The A.V. has “defiled.” The explanation of this word seems to be that “it is separated to Jehovah and his sanctuary like things under the ban” (Adam Smith) and so shown to be a religious offence. The LXX has ἵνα μὴ ἁγιασθῇ which Philo, taking ἵνα as often to be consecutive, makes = “so that it is not sanctified.”</note>


<note n="8.143.c">Heinemann’s translation of these words “mishandles and mutilates” (or “mangles”), seems to me to miss their force. Mangey’s “insultat et illudit” is better. The general meaning of σπαθάω is “to spend wastefully,” though since wastefulness is not a very obvious characteristic of the action here, “wantonness” might be better.</note>



<note n="8.142.1">MSS. ἐκνόμοις ἐπιθυμίαις.</note>



<note n="8.145.a">Or perhaps “covetous actions directed against men”
(as opposed to those directed against plants).</note>


<note n="8.145.b">Deut. xx. 10 ff., which describe the proper conduct of war against distant nations, as opposed to the heathen Canaanites, who are to be exterminated. The curious way in which Philo here limits this to war against those who revolt from an alliance, which might perhaps be taken to include breaking treaties in general, can only be explained, I think, as expressing a conviction that the Law could never have intended to sanction wars of conquest or aggression.</note>



<note n="8.144.1">Cohn inserts διττοῖς before δασμοῖς. It does not seem to
me necessary.</note>




<note n="8.147.a">Verse 11 “they shall become tributary and serve thee,”
which Philo much softens down.</note>


<note n="8.147.b">Verse 13. Again much softened down from “thou shalt
smite every male thereof,” i.e. in the city, not merely the
opposing force. On the other hand, burning the city is not suggested, except in the case of those who have apostatized from the religion of Jehovah, and then the spoil also is accursed and burnt (Deut. xiii. 16).</note>


<note n="8.147.c">Here though the Hebrew (<hi rend="italic">v.</hi> 14) includes the women in the booty, Philo has some authority for his more merciful interpretation in the LXX, which has “thou shalt smite every male, except the women and the stuff (ἀποσκεύη),” and then goes on to describe the booty.</note>



<note n="8.149.a">Deut. xx. 19 f.</note>


<note n="8.149.b">Verse 20 “Is the tree of the field man, that it should be
besieged of thee?” The LXX in the last part has εἰσελθεῖν ἀπὸ
προσώπου σου εἰς τὸν χάρακα (“enter before thee into siegework”),
which may mean like the Hebrew “to be besieged,”
but might easily be taken to mean “besiege,” whence Philo’s
“show ill will.”</note>
