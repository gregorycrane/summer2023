“words” in general.</note>


<note n="5.335.c">Philo here seems to abandon his regular interpretation of κατ’ εἰκόνα θεοῦ as “made in the likeness of the image,” i.e. of the Logos. (See <hi rend="italic">e.g. Leg. All.</hi> iii. 96.)</note>


<note n="5.335.d">This “reasoning,” in which, though the term “sun”

<note n="5.337.a">The word φῶς here puzzled Mangey, who suggested its omission, which would make the quotation pointless. I think the text may stand.

<note n="5.344.1">Wend. was inclined to insert μὴ either before δικαίᾳ or

presumably persons who exercise an evil influence on others.
If αἳ and ἀφαιρούμεναι, they are evil forces within us. The former is suggested by §§ 106 and 107. At the end of the meditation, however, we seem to pass into the other thought. See note on § 112.</note>

of λόγος seems to be the man’s evil self who must restore it
to the owner or true self before it is too late. He perhaps
means to imply that if he does so, the sufficient though
inferior light of λόγος may serve him, as it did the Practiser,
in place of the true divine illumination. If he does not, he
will be plunged into utter darkness.</note>




<note n="5.359.a">i.e. §§ 87–114, which have supported the argument that
the sun which set was God Himself and thus lead up to the

<note n="5.359.c">λόγοι and λόγος, which in these sections passes so bewilderingly through its many shades of meaning, seems here to be reduced to its lowest value.</note>

the “position above the horizon” with apprehension. But it is really the <hi rend="italic">thought</hi> that it apprehends which constitutes that position, just as the renunciation of the thought constitutes the setting.</note>

went by lineal descent, and if registered as held by a man’s

therefore becomes both God and Lord to Jacob (ἑκάτερον referring to this double aspect, not to “father and grandfather”). Philo here ignores the point made in the next section, that God is not called “the Lord” of Isaac. The plural πατέρων καὶ πάππων is perhaps used because the truth applies to all φιλάρετοι.</note>

Him, then realizing how the subject transcends human

the world of place and sense the manifestation of divine
goodness and the means by which we can rise to higher
conceptions, is obtained (1) by taking τόπος first as “place”
and then as “topic”; (2) by treating οὐκ ἔστι τοῦτο with an audacity surprising even in Philo. He first takes it by itself = “this is not the case,” then coupled with ἄλλ᾿ ἢ οἶκος θεοῦ.

<note n="5.409.a">i.e. Bezaleel is called σοφός (“filled with the spirit of
wisdom” Ex. xxxi. 3), and the work is ἔργον ποικιλτοῦ (Ex.
xxvi. 36 and elsewhere).</note>


<note n="5.409.b">The section is obscure, but the meaning perhaps may
be something as follows. Knowledge shaped by the tool of
variegation in divine hands stands like a sacred statue in the
temple of the universe. And this serves as a model to the
Practising Soul (=the lover of wisdom in § 205), when he
creates the varieties of human knowledge described in that
section. The point of the last words is that this agrees with
the order of the vision in which the διάλευκοι, here standing
for the higher ideal knowledge, are followed by the ποικίλοι.</note>


<note n="5.409.c"><hi rend="italic">i.e</hi>. Philo does not deny that the literal meaning of σποδοειδεῖς ῥαντοί is ash-coloured and spotted (or with ash-coloured spots?) and that this indicates much the same as variegated, but spiritually what is intended is “sprinkled with ashes and water,” the allegorical meaning of which is explained in the next section.</note>




<note n="5.411.a">“Ashes,” however, are not mentioned here. See
App. p. 604.</note>




<note n="5.412.1">Some MSS. καθαρά τε, others ἀρραγεστέρα (-έστατον).</note>



<note n="5.413.a">i.e. the twelve signs of the Zodiac, <hi rend="italic">cf. De Spec. Leg.</hi> i. 87.</note>


<note n="5.413.b">i.e. not of wool, <hi rend="italic">cf. De Ebr.</hi> 86.</note>






<note n="5.418.1">The construction is extremely awkward. The majority
of MSS. have ἀδύνατον, which coupled with Wend.’s conjecture
of τῶν for μή would give a more tolerable sentence.
Mangey’s translation, also reading ἀδύνατον, “that man may
believe in the existence of those qualities in God the absence
of which is incomprehensible to him,” gives a sense which is
suited to the argument which follows, but how could such
an inference be drawn from ἐγώ εἰμι ὁ ὤν?</note>



<note n="5.419.a">Philo of course fails to understand that the LXX τόπος
θεοῦ is a translation of the Hebrew place-name Bethel.</note>


<note n="5.419.b">If this is the right translation of the passage, Philo
would seem to use δεισιδαιμονία, as the Latin <hi rend="italic">superstitio</hi> sometimes is, for over-fine scrupulousness in the use of words. But is this possible? See App. pp. 604 f. for this and the connexion of thought in these sections.</note>


<note n="5.419.c">The reference is to Ex. vi. 3. See <hi rend="italic">De Mut</hi>. 13 f.</note>




<note n="5.420.1">Perhaps &lt;ἱερὸς&gt; λόγος.</note>



<note n="5.421.a">An obvious allusion to <hi rend="italic">Od.</hi> xvii. 485:
καί τε θεοὶ ξείνοισιν ἐοικότες ἀλλοδαποῖσι,
παντοῖοι τελέθοντες, ἐπιστρωφῶσι πόληας,
ἀνθρώπων ὕβριν τε καὶ εὐνομίην ἐφορῶντες.</note>


<note n="5.421.b">For the thought in this and the following sections <hi rend="italic">cf. De Sac</hi>. 94 f., <hi rend="italic">Quod Deus</hi> 53 f.</note>


<note n="5.421.c">See note on <hi rend="italic">Quod Deus</hi> 53.</note>




<note n="5.423.a">Or perhaps “on the present occasion,” contrasted not only with the Hagar story, but also with the Ladder Vision.
The thought seems to be that while the Hagar-mind and
even the Jacob-mind, in its lower stage, draw no distinction
between the higher and the lower manifestations of the
divine and mistake the Angel or the Logos for “the God,” the Practiser has now reached the point where he can comprehend the highest as really implicit in the lower, and this truth is revealed to him by God Himself.</note>




<note n="5.424.1">See on § 158.</note>


<note n="5.424.2">MSS. ἀνθρώπων.</note>



<note n="5.425.a">There is of course no suggestion of an inscription
either in Gen. xxxi. 13 or in the original story, cf. Gen.
xxviii. 18. But Philo, familiar with inscriptions on dedicatory
slabs, takes the phrase “he set it up as a pillar” to mean
that the soul, firmly convinced of God’s stability, <hi rend="italic">records</hi> (cf.
ὕμνους ἐγχαράξεις, § 256) its conviction and dedicates itself.</note>


<note n="5.425.b">Lit. “making to stand.” See App. p. 605.</note>


<note n="5.425.c">Cf. De Corona § 21 οὐδ᾿ ἂν σὺ διαρραγῆς ψευδόμενος and
<hi rend="italic">ibid</hi>. § 87.</note>




<note n="5.426.1">MSS. αὐτῶ.</note>


<note n="5.426.2">Wend. suggests περικαταγεῖσα. But the form κατεάχθην
has sufficient authority.</note>



<note n="5.427.a">See App. p. 605.</note>


<note n="5.427.b">Or “looks round with admiration,” as elsewhere in Philo.</note>




<note n="5.428.1">Most MSS. have ὀ εὐξάμενος, Wend. with some εὐξάμενος.
The article is needed. The argument is that the vow involves
self-dedication, because, though in itself it is merely a
dedication of the hair, ἅγιος shews that the man himself is
included.</note>

<note n="5.455.a">Memories (μνῆμαι), a quite intelligible word, though in itself less natural than judgements or opinions (γνῶμαι), is, I

“double cave” (LXX for Machpelah) he says ἡ Χεβρὼν αὕτη,
μνήμας ἐπιστήμης καὶ σοφίας θησαυροφυλακοῦσα. The thought is perhaps drawn from the word μνημεῖον applied to the cave in Gen. xxiii. 6. For the favourable way in which duality is regarded in these sections, contrasted with that in § 70, see note <hi rend="italic">ad loc.</hi>, App. p. 608.</note>

perhaps no connexion of thought with the preceding. His point in quoting the text lay in the first part “reap the reaping,” but as usual he is drawn into making some comment on the rest of the verse.</note>

<note n="5.473.b">The connexion of thought seems to be drawn from the

<note n="5.501.b">Wend, notes that Cohn wished to transpose “summer”and “winter.” Though this may at first sight seem more likely, I think Wend, is right in following the MSS. Railing at extremes of the natural is more impious than railing at the unnatural, and the words about spring and autumn bear this out.</note>

hand would read ψυχῆς and bracket θιάσου. But the latter
is evidently needed to represent the brothers, and that the
δυνάμεις should be called the θίασος ψυχῆς seems to me quite
natural.</note>



<note n="5.505.a">The thought seems to be that Jacob’s question means
“it was no dream but a spiritual delusion.” If it was a dream no blame would attach (§ 137). I have therefore put a colon, as Mangey, after εἶδες, instead of a mark of interrogation as Wend. The question form, however, in the rest of the sentence does not fit in very well. I suggest οὐκ εἶδες
&lt;μᾶλλον&gt; ἢ ὑπέλαβες, a favourite form with Philo for οὐκ . . . ἀλλά.</note>

Philo is speaking of what frequently happens.</note>

<note n="5.507.a">Wendland and Mangey punctuate τῦφον πρότερον ἀφ-
(Mangey ὑφ)έντες, i.e. “casting away our former pride.”
This seems to me impossible in view of the use of τῦφος throughout. To cast away τῦφος in Philo’s sense would be a worthy action, not as here unworthy. Moreover in § 140 it is clearly indicated as the recipient of misplaced homage. I feel no doubt that τῦφον is the object of προσενξώμεθα. As I have translated it, there are three stages: (1) standing with uplifted hands, (2) bowing, (3) falling prostrate, the last representing the LXX ἐπὶ τήν γῆν. But I should like clearer authority for ὑφεῖναι ἑαυτούς = “to bow,” and the use of πρότερον for πρῶτον may seem strange, but <hi rend="italic">cf. De Mos</hi>. ii. 49 and 184.

<note n="5.511.b">The thought seems to be that the unsatisfied yearning

the very yearning has something
com- forting in it. But it is strange that these two should be put in antithesis as “hunger” and “thirst,” particularly as ἀκράτου in the previous sentence and ἑτέρας πήγης in this suggest that the λιμός includes thirst as well as hunger, <hi rend="italic">cf.
