<note n="9.112.1">So Cohn with some MSS. Conybeare with others ἀφορητότερον,
which he says is certainly the true reading. The
weight of authority is perhaps in its favour, but the explanation
which he gives, viz. that the Essenes were so highly
esteemed that the suggestion that they were not necessarily
superior in every way would be unpalatable, does not seem
natural.</note>

of numbers as the Dyad is the “mother,” the One stands above all as representing Deity. Others however rank the Monad above the One, as perhaps Philo does here and in <hi rend="italic">De Praem.</hi> 40, where he uses identical language.</note>

on the other hand (ii. 6) that he gave it all over to his

<note n="9.122.1">Some MSS. χρωμένους, which Conybeare adopts.</note>

though there ἡ τέχνη is <hi rend="italic">the</hi> art, i.e. of medicine.</note>


<note n="9.123.c">It is certainly strange to find this exact reference. In
the great majority of his references to Homer (of which the
index, probably not exhaustively, gives over fifty) he does not
indicate the source at all. Sometimes the quotation is
definitely ascribed to ὁ δοκιμώτατος τῶν ποιητῶν, and thrice at
least elsewhere (<hi rend="italic">De Conf.</hi> 4, <hi rend="italic">Quod Omn. Prob.</hi> 31, <hi rend="italic">Legatio</hi> 80)
he mentions him by name. Perhaps this departure from the
usual course is due to the nature of the quotation. It is not
like most of them a notable or familiar phrase, but comes from a passage which would not in itself attract attention, and only serves to bring out a connexion (ἄβιος with δίκαιος) which would not occur to most people. On the use of ῥαψῳδία
see App. p. 519.</note>


<note n="9.123.d"><hi rend="italic">Il.</hi> xiii. 5, 6. Ἀβίων is by some taken to be a proper name, by others as = “having no fixed means of subsistence,”
<hi rend="italic">i.e</hi>. nomads. Philo evidently takes it as an adjective meaning without βίος in the sense of means of life.</note>


<note n="9.123.e">See note on <hi rend="italic">De Virt.</hi> 6, where “the wealth of nature,”
i.e. the simple means of living, bread and water, which are equally available to all, is distinguished from the “seeing wealth,” i.e. the spiritual wealth of virtue and wisdom, though it is superior to the “blind wealth,” here called the
“wealth of vain opinion.”</note>




<note n="9.125.a">Or as Conybeare translates it “the intercourse with and
influence from persons,” etc., to express the curious preposition
instead of the usual πρός with accusative as <hi rend="italic">e.g. De</hi> <hi rend="italic">Dec.</hi> 127. He suggests that ἐπιμιξία may carry with it the idea of contagion.</note>

<note n="9.127.b">Or “the other books” (of the O.T.). See App. p. 520.</note>




<note n="9.128.1">Conybeare νομοθεσίαν mainly on the authority of the
Armenian.</note>



<note n="9.129.a">The translation takes φιλοσοφίαν as cognate accusative
after φιλοσοφοῦσι as in <hi rend="italic">Mos.</hi> ii. 216. <hi rend="italic">Cf. De Som.</hi> i. 55
φιλοσόφησον ἀναγκαιοτάτην . . . φιλοσοφίαν. But it may be
governed by ἀλληγοροῦντες, <hi rend="italic">cf. Spec. Leg.</hi> ii. 29.</note>


<note n="9.129.b">I understand ἑρμηνεία to be here used as elsewhere, <hi rend="italic">e.g.
Quis Rerum</hi> 108, in the technical rhetorical sense of the
language in which the thought is expressed as opposed to the
thought itself, and so with the synonymous λέξις or φράσις corresponding to the Latin elocutio. Conybeare gives
“literal meaning.” Lake (translating Euseb. <hi rend="italic">Hist. Eccl.</hi> where this passage is quoted) “literal interpretation.” ἀποκεκρυμμένης φύσεως
may perhaps mean “a hidden natural (i.e. theological) truth,” cf. again <hi rend="italic">Mos</hi>. ii. 216 and note there and <hi rend="italic">De Abr.</hi> 99.</note>


<note n="9.129.c">Conybeare “of the idea involved in allegory.” But I do not think that Philo except when he is speaking Platonically
used ἰδέα thus. Lake’s “of the meaning allegorically expressed” is still farther away. ἰδέα is, I think, simply the form or kind of treatment which we find in allegory.</note>


<note n="9.129.d">The phrase τῆς προαιρέσεως τὸν τρόπον is obscure. Lake has “treatment” for προαιρ. But the word must suggest a motive or purpose. Conybeare “emulating the ideal of character traced out in them.” I understand προαιρ. to mean the belief which inspired the allegorists that the scriptures were to be interpreted allegorically. Their successors emulated the method in which this principle was carried out.</note>




<note n="9.131.a">Here again we have a doubtful phrase. Conybeare
translates “which they write down in solemn rhythms as best
they can,” a meaning which ἀναγκαίως certainly bears in
Philo and elsewhere. His explanation is that they could not
engrave them on stone (hymns for worship seem to have
been thus cut in stone) and so were fain to use papyrus. Lake quite impossibly gives “arrange” for χαράττουσι.
Philo is clearly referring to the accepted division of music into metre, melody and rhythm, see note on <hi rend="italic">De Som.</hi> i. 205 (vol. v. pp. 603 f.), and the suggestion made very tentatively in the translation is that it is the rhythm which gives the solemnity necessary for sacred music and that this was indicated by some notation.</note>




<note n="9.133.a"><hi rend="italic">Cf. Quod Omn. Prob.</hi> 8. Here Philo follows Plato more
definitely. See <hi rend="italic">Phaedrus</hi> 259 C τὸ τεττίγων γένος . . . γέρας τοῦτο παρὰ Μουσῶν λαβόν, μηδὲν τροφῆς δεῖσθαι, ἀλλ᾿ ἄσιτὸν τε καὶ ἄποτον εὐθὺς γενόμενον ᾄδειν, ἕως ἂν τελευτήσῃ. The idea that the grasshopper needs no food except air (or more frequently dew) goes back to Hesiod, <hi rend="italic">Shield</hi> 395 if. τέττιξ . . . ᾧτε πόσις καὶ βρῶσις θηλῦς ἐέρση.</note>

<note n="9.134.2">ἡ ὀθόνη Conybeare. See note <hi rend="italic">c.</hi></note>



<note n="9.135.a">Conybeare translates “they anoint the body, releasing it
just as you might the lower animals from the long spell of
toil.” But neither anointing in the literal sense nor rest from
labour for the Therapeutae themselves suits the context,
which is concerned with the general abstemiousness in food
and mild relaxation on the sabbath. The sense I have given
to λιπαίνω is much the same as in <hi rend="italic">Spec. Leg.</hi> iv. 74, where it
is applied to relieving the hard condition of the needy by
charity. The point of ἀμέλει, as I have taken it, is that the
release of the cattle from labour on the sabbath is a duty
recognized by everybody. But see App. p. 520.</note>


<note n="9.135.b">Conybeare’s reading, ἀντὶ for ἀπὸ which certainly seems to have the better MS. authority, is based by him, as stated in a long and interesting note, on the general belief that linen was more sacred than any substance which was the produce of animals—an idea stated by Philo himself in several places, <hi rend="italic">e.g. Spec. Leg.</hi> i. 84. The chief objection seems to be that χλαῖνα would have to be understood as = “linen garment,” whereas such evidence as I have seen goes to show that it was frequently, if not usually, made of wool, and wool was as unclean as skin.</note>


<note n="9.135.c">Conybeare, reading ἡ for ἢ, translates “a smock without sleeves, the linen coat namely.” He says that ἢ does not make sense, meaning apparently that as any garment made of linen would be an ὀθόνη, it could not be an alternative to the ἐξωμίς. In <hi rend="italic">Spec. Leg.</hi> ii. 20, the χλαῖνα is coupled with the ὀθόνη, and in <hi rend="italic">Hyp.</hi> 11. 12 with the ἐξωμίς as simple garments for winter and summer respectively. This perhaps supports his view.</note>




<note n="9.136.1">The MSS. reverse the case of the nouns τύφου . . . ψεῦδος
. . . ἀτυφίας . . . ἀλήθειαν. The correction, which is supported
by the Latin version and is accepted by both Cohn
and Conybeare, make better sense. Both (i.e. τῦφος and
ἀτυφία) lead respectively to the falsehood and truth, from
which flow evil and good, and may therefore be regarded
(λόγον ἔχει) as a πηγή.</note>


<note n="9.136.2">Perhaps read φυσικὸν &lt;φάρμακον&gt;. See note <hi rend="italic">b.</hi></note>


<note n="9.136.3">So Conybeare with some authorities. Cohn with MSS.

<note n="9.137.b">This must be the meaning if the word is right. But there is no really parallel use of the word at any rate without some explanatory noun, τὰ φυσικὰ found in the <hi rend="italic">Geoponica</hi> (? date) is stated by Stephanus not to bear this meaning. φυσικὸν φάρμακον, to which the Armenian is said to point, is quoted from Alexander Trallianus (? sixth century A.D.).</note>

<note n="9.138.1">Bracketed by Cohn on the grounds that it is omitted by

talking of competitors rather than victors, and it may well
be a gloss, but these are doubtful reasons. If, as Cohn

<note n="9.141.a">For τρίκλινα see App. p. 521. The MSS. περίκλινα would mean “couches round the table.”</note>




<note n="9.142.1">Cohn in both editions prints γόνου, which I think must
be a mere misprint. Not only is such a form unknown, but
Conybeare who prints γόνυ (as Mangey) gives no sign that
there is any variation in the MSS.</note>


<note n="9.142.2">Cohn inserts ἢ after μειράκια, citing <hi rend="italic">De Cher.</hi> 114, and
<hi rend="italic">Hypothetica</hi> 11. 3, in both of which we have μειράκια distinguished
from the πρωτογένειοι. He does not seem to
observe that this would involve changing πρωτογένεια to
πρωτογένειοι. At least I do not see how the neuter could
be defended.</note>


<note n="9.142.3">Perhaps correct to φασιν, but see note <hi rend="italic">e.</hi></note>


<note n="9.142.4">MSS. ἀπειροκαλία.</note>



<note n="9.143.a">Conybeare translates “trimmed off equally all round, in
a neatly bevelled curved line.”</note>


<note n="9.143.b">This sentence has been transcribed bodily from Conybeare’s
“provisional rendering” in his commentary. I do not profess to understand clearly either the Greek or the English. The revision given in his translation somewhat later does not differ materially except that οὐλοτέραις ταῖς σειραίαις ἐπιδιπλώσεσι is rendered “with bows of twisted ribbons doubled over.”</note>


<note n="9.143.c">Or “waiting in relays.”</note>


<note n="9.143.d">Or perhaps “over elaborately” (considering the kind of work they have to do).</note>


<note n="9.143.e">φασιν or νομίζουσιν (as Mangey) would certainly be more natural, but perhaps no alteration is required, or if any, ἀληθέστερον for ἀληθές. It is not denied that opulence is displayed. What the guests do not know is that it is bad taste.</note>




<note n="9.144.1">I have printed §§ 53–55 according to Cohn’s text, though
I do not feel certain that the transposition which he makes is
correct. His theory is that originally after καθαριότητι in
§ 53 stood something like οἱ γοῦν παρελθόντες ἐς τὰ συμπόσια
and that § 55 ended with something like πρὸς τὸν πότον
τρέπονται. Somehow in the MSS. §§ 53 f. got transferred to others? The picture is barely intelligble, and undoubtedly
Cohn’s order gives a better sense. On the other hand to
postulate first the transposition and then the omission of some
ten words seems drastic, particularly as, so far as I can see,
their retention would not have made worse nonsense. Conybeare
translates the manuscript version without apparently
finding anything very incongruous. after § 55, and then the words πρὸς τὸν πότον τρέπονται. οἱ γοῦν παρελθόντες ἐς τὰ συμπόσια fell out. This is what we find in the MSS. According to this the guests having gorged themselves with food turn their necks round, gaze and sniff at the food, and then urge others to eat. Who are these</note>

<note n="9.146.1">MSS. εἱστιᾶτο, which Conybeare retains and perhaps is not impossible, but the active with the host as subject and the occasion as a cognate accusative agrees with the ordinary usage.</note>

For similar denunciations of the evil <hi rend="italic">cf. Spec. Leg.</hi> iii. 37 ff. and <hi rend="italic">De Abr.</hi> 135 ff.</note>




<note n="9.150.1">Most MSS. ἐρωτικαῖς, which might at first sight be defended
by the statement of the teller of the fable, that it is told to
show the δύναμις ἔρωτος. But the words do not apply to
this earlier but to the later part of the fable and the phrase
δυνάμεις ἑνωτικαί occurs in <hi rend="italic">De Plant.</hi> 89.</note>



<note n="9.151.a">Philo is perhaps thinking of Plato, <hi rend="italic">Laws</hi> 838 E, where
the same practice is described as sowing in rocks and stones. He has used much the same language of mating with barren women in <hi rend="italic">Spec. Leg.</hi> iii. 34.</note>


<note n="9.151.b">The allusion is to the combination of men and women, the original third sex, set forth by Aristophanes in <hi rend="italic">Symp.</hi> 189 E–190.</note>


<note n="9.151.c">Conybeare “from a lofty vantage ground.” The phrase is a favourite of Philo’s for equalling “with plenty to spare.” Sometimes it is contrasted with ἴσος as in <hi rend="italic">Quod Omn. Prob.</hi> 149 and <hi rend="italic">Flacc.</hi> 126, or is coupled with κρατεῖν or νικᾶν as in <hi rend="italic">De Agr.</hi> 112 and <hi rend="italic">De Post.</hi> 161 (so in <hi rend="italic">De Aet.</hi> 80 πολλῇ τινι περιουσίᾳ). In other cases it seems to intensify an action or create a superlative. So <hi rend="italic">Mos.</hi> i. 93 and ii. 75 and so, I think, here.</note>


<note n="9.151.d">So, I think, rather than “means of livelihood” (Conybeare).</note>




<note n="9.153.a">I believe with Conybeare that this refers to the feast of
Pentecost. But Philo writes carelessly when he omits to
tell us from what time the seven weeks are calculated. In
<hi rend="italic">Spec. Leg.</hi> ii. 176 he has stated that they are calculated from
the “Sheaf,” the festival on the second (?) day after the
passover, and presumably he means the same here. But
Conybeare is too severe when he scolds Lucius for supposing
δι᾿ ἑπτὰ ἑβδ. to mean “every seven weeks.” Since at present
we have only heard of minor meetings every week, that
would be the natural meaning. Wendland indeed takes it
so. See App. p. 522 on this and the meaning of πρῶτον
μέν, which Conybeare translates “for the first time.”</note>


<note n="9.153.b">We are naturally surprised to see Pentecost rather than
the Passover called the chief feast, but see App. p. 523.</note>


<note n="9.153.c">i.e. 3, 4, 5 are the sides of the primal right-angled triangle
    and 3^2 + 4^2 + 5^2 = 50. See the full explanation in <hi rend="italic">Spec. Leg.</hi>
ii. 176 and <hi rend="italic">Mos.</hi> ii. 80, and the notes thereon.</note>


<note n="9.153.d">Conybeare considers that these ἐφημερευταί are the same as the πρόεδροι mentioned later and quotes an inscription of A.D. 174 ἐφημερεύοντος Παυσανίου προέδρου in minutes of a βουλή in Tyre. But the word in itself merely suggests duties performed in rotation, and ὑπηρεσίαις points to what we should describe as a sidesman rather than an officiating minister.</note>


<note n="9.153.e">Conybeare “pretence.” But Philo often uses the word in a way hardly distinguishable from “cause.” So e.g. the eyesight is damaged μικρᾶς ἕνεκα προφάσεως <hi rend="italic">Spec. Leg.</hi> iv. 200 and the firstborn in Egypt suddenly perish ἀπ᾿ οὐδεμιᾶς προφάσεως <hi rend="italic">Mos.</hi> i. 135. If the word differs at all from αἰτία, it is that it indicates not the absolute cause, but what people may consider to be the cause. So perhaps here “anything that might be regarded as a money-making business.”</note>




<note n="9.154.1">MSS. παλαίους.</note>


<note n="9.154.2">ἀλλ᾿ . . . παῖδας are bracketed by Cohn. The only

seems weak, and Mangey suggested εἰς τὸ ἐνδόσιμον “to give
the keynote for the hymn which followed.”</note>


<note n="9.162.2">For the comma which I have inserted after ἐπῶν see
note <hi rend="italic">b.</hi></note>



<note n="9.163.a">As I understand the sentence, it is more literally “when
the discussion seems to him in accordance with his purpose
to have met successfully the objects aimed at, and to them
the listening seems to have turned out according to their
purpose,” etc. That is to say δοκῇ κατὰ προαίρεσιν ἀπηντηκέναι
is understood with τοῖς δὲ, but while with τῷ μὲν it is further
explained by εὐσκόπως ταῖς ἐπιβολαῖς, with τοῖς δὲ this is not
added, so that in the first case ἀπηντηκέναι=“to have met,” in
the second= “to have turned out”; cf. κατὰ νοῦν ἀπαντῆσαι § 66.
Conybeare takes ἐπιβολαῖς= “the points raised.” But the
regular use of the word in Philo seems to be “aim” or mental effort of some kind. <hi rend="italic">Cf. e.g.</hi> τὰς . . . τῆς ψυχῆς ἐπιβολάς τε καὶ ὁρμάς <hi rend="italic">Mos.</hi> i. 26, κατὰ τὴν ἰδίαν ἐπιβολήν (“of his own motion”) <hi rend="italic">De Som.</hi> i. 1.</note>


<note n="9.163.b">For the use of ἔπη for hexameter verse in particular see examples in Stephanus, but it is no doubt permissible to take it = “verses,” simply in agreement with τριμέτρων..</note>


<note n="9.163.c">Conybeare translates the last four words “deftly proportioned for turning and returning.” On these hymns in general see App. p. 524.</note>


<note n="9.163.d">Conybeare “all-purest.” The epithet seems strange, since it is followed at once by the statement that the shew-bread
in purity ranked above it. No one has suggested, and I only do it with hesitation, that the negative before παναγέστατον,
as often, has fallen out.</note>




<note n="9.164.1">So the Armenian. MSS. τῶν ἄρτων.</note>


<note n="9.164.2">So the Armenian. MSS. χρείᾳ.</note>


<note n="9.164.3">MSS. ἀνδρῶν. One however has τῶν ἀνδρῶν ἰδίᾳ καὶ τῶν γυναικῶν ἰδίᾳ, which Mangey has. χορῶν adopted by both Cohn and Conybeare is from the Armenian.</note>



<note n="9.165.a">The LXX though not the Hebrew prescribes salt with the shewbread. See <hi rend="italic">Mos.</hi> ii. 104.</note>




<note n="9.166.1">The construction is very strange. Cohn suggests καθιστάντες.
Perhaps σταθέντες.</note>



<note n="9.167.a">Or “congealed.”</note>




<note n="9.168.1">An explanatory genitive is perhaps required. But I do
not understand why Cohn (<hi rend="italic">Hermes</hi>, 1916, p. 91) summarily
rejects the more natural αὐτοῦ.</note>



<note n="9.169.a">As the Therapeutae would naturally, like the Essenes (<hi rend="italic">cf.
Quod Omn. Prob.</hi> 80), deal only with the theological side of physic, I think this must be what is referred to by τῶν ἐν αὐτῇ.
Elsewhere the phrase seems to mean the contents of the natural world. I should like to omit τῶν and translate “lived in it and the soul alone.”</note>


<note n="9.169.b">The conjunction with προυξένησεν shows clearly that συσταθέντες is here used in the quite common sense of “commended “rather than as Conybeare “established.”</note>
