<note n="9.303.b">The name of Iberus is mentioned by Dio Cass. lviii. 19. 6 as succeeding Vitrasius Pollio as prefect of Egypt. Older editions adopting the reading of most of the MSS. called him Severus. <hi rend="italic">Cf. De Som.</hi> ii. 123 and note, vol. v. p. 609.</note>




<note n="9.305.a"><hi rend="italic">Cf.</hi> § 133.</note>


<note n="9.305.b">παρρησία seems to be used here in a wider sense than the
ordinary “frankness of speech” and to describe a person
who shows his mind by actions as well as speech.</note>


<note n="9.305.c">Or simply “behaved in matters generally like drunkards.”
So Josephus, <hi rend="italic">Ant.</hi> vi. 12. 7 uses the phrase of
Saul’s general conduct. <hi rend="italic">Cf. De Ios.</hi> 45, where the adulterer
ἐμπαροινεῖ ταῖς ἔλπισιν of the husband. But the description
of the θίασοι in § 136 suggests that drunkenness in the literal
sense is intended.</note>


<note n="9.305.d">This is a curious use of ἐφεδρεύω. The regular sense of of the word in Philo is to watch or wait generally for an opportunity to attack, sometimes to help. So in <hi rend="italic">De Mig.</hi> 57 πρὸς βοήθειαν δύναμις ἀρωγὸς ἐφεδρεύει παρὰ θεῷ. In other writers the sense of waiting seems sometimes to be lost, and it is used more generally for “help” or “reinforce” though hardly in the sense required here of improving the morale of the troops.</note>


<note n="9.305.e">Box gives “detail to special duties.”</note>




<note n="9.307.a">Box takes μεμνημένος as agreeing with Flaccus instead
of the indinidual soldier. This is grammatically possible,
but I think the run of the sentence is against it, and “remembered” is hardly the word we should expect. I doubt also whether the sense is much, if at all, better. The soldier may very properly be admonished to remember that he is a policeman as well.</note>




<note n="9.308.1">The translation is based on the suggestion that some such
phrase as ὧν ἔδει has fallen out. The simplest emendation
perhaps would be to change καὶ to καίπερ or, according to
Philo’s common use, to καίτοι “though he had neglected
later” (to take an active part). But can ἐπιλελησμένος mean
this?</note>



<note n="9.309.a">For this use of γνήσιος see note on <hi rend="italic">Quod omn. Prob.</hi> 87.</note>


<note n="9.309.b">Tiberius Gemellus. For him and other historical points
in these sections see App. p. 531.</note>


<note n="9.309.c">The statement seems hardly consistent with what has
been said just before. A better sense can be got if πολὺ
πρότερον can be taken as a “much graver matter,” i.e. the
effect of the news upon him extended much begond the
refusal to speak. There are other passages in Philo which point to some such meaning for the phrase. In <hi rend="italic">Spec. Leg.</hi> i. 101 (of priests marrying) we have “he is a man πολὺ πρότερον than a priest and therefore must feel the desire for mating.” Here the idea may be that manhood is a wider thing than priesthood. In <hi rend="italic">De Mig.</hi> 87, “there is no use in seeming to be so and so, unless you are it πολὺ πρότερον.” Here “<hi rend="italic">long</hi> before” is rather pointless and a better sense is got if the phrase emphasizes the necessity of “being.” In <hi rend="italic">Legatio</hi> 115 the Jews have been taught from the cradle to worship the one God, by their parents and teachers and πολὺ πρότερον by the holy laws. So also perhaps <hi rend="italic">Mos.</hi> i. 162, <hi rend="italic">De Praem.</hi> 88.</note>


<note n="9.309.d">On Macro see <hi rend="italic">Legatio</hi> 32–61, where what is stated here is given much more fully.</note>




<note n="9.311.a">The word παρανάλωμα recurs in <hi rend="italic">Legatio</hi> 369, but in a
different sense. There life if sacrificed for no profitable
purpose is a παρανάλωμα. Here the idea may be as in the
translation, or perhaps simply “an extra expenditure,”
i.e. “having got rid of Tiberius let us get rid of his kin too.”</note>


<note n="9.311.b">Or simply “martinet,” “strict disciplinarian.” The word is coupled by Plutarch with ὀμφακίας and στρυφνός in describing a harsh father. For other examples see Stephanus, who explains it as meaning a person who reckons αὐτὰ ἕκαστα and leaves nothing out.</note>




<note n="9.312.1">Some word or phrase to express policy seems to be
needed. Reiter suggests δόξαντα.</note>



<note n="9.313.a">Dionysius’s name does not recur again in this treatise, but see App. p. 532, on him as well as on Isidorus and Lampo.</note>




<note n="9.315.a">Or perhaps “paper-nosing,” if that is not too slangy.
“Paper-porer” is a variation on L. &amp; S.’s “record-porer.”
This epithet, which recurs again in § 131, is taken from <hi rend="italic">De</hi> <hi rend="italic">Cor.</hi> 209. Though it is uncertain whether Demosthenes applies it to Aeschines as a scribe, or as an usher in his father’s school, Philo clearly takes it in the first sense. No effective rendering has been suggested to my knowledge for the term which describes a pedant hunching his shoulders over writings. Kennedy translates it by “scribbler,” Abbott by “hack of a scribe.” Dr. Rouse suggests to me a number of renderings of which I select “ledger-dredger” as the most effective.</note>


<note n="9.315.b">This epithet is again applied to Isidorus in § 137.</note>




<note n="9.317.a">For Agrippa see App. p. 532.</note>

<note n="9.318.1">Other suggestions are συγγεγενημένην or ἐγγεγενημένην.
(Perhaps συγγεγεννημένην as Cohn in <hi rend="italic">De Praem.</hi> 62.)</note>


<note n="9.318.2">MSS. προσκαλούμενοι.</note>



<note n="9.319.a">This and indeed the general excitement caused by
Agrippa’s visit seem inconsistent with his attempt to remain
incognito. The explanation presumably is that the Jews
forced this change of attitude on him. We find later (§ 103) that they took the occasion to lay before him their grievance against Flaccus for failing to transmit their address to Gaius and doubtless were as ready to make much of his royal status as the Alexandrines were to resent it.</note>


<note n="9.319.b">πλῷ here = εὐπλοιᾳ. See examples in L. &amp; S. revised, e.g. πλοῦς ἡμῖν γίγνεται, and the same phrase as here πλῷ χρήσασθαι Thuc. iii. 3. 5. <hi rend="italic">Cf.</hi> also εὐπλοίᾳ χρησάμενος § 27 above.</note>




<note n="9.321.a">i.e. “took a leaf from their book,” referring to the Carabas incident which was a sort of “mime.” See Box’s notes on §§ 34 and 38.</note>




<note n="9.322.1">So MSS. This otherwise unknown word, for which
L. &amp; S. gives “which cannot be feigned,” makes nonsense
here. So also does ἄσκεπτος, which Mangey adopts and
translates “improvisus.” I think that another suggestion
ἀσκεπὴς (better in the equivalent form ἀσκέπαστος) is not quite
hopeless. From its natural meaning of “uncovered” it might come to mean “defenceless” and so as applied to a position “indefensible” and therefore “dangerous,” which seems to be what we want here. But we have no knowledge of any such development. Box very tentatively suggests ἄστεκτος = “insufferable.”</note>



<note n="9.323.a"><hi rend="italic">Cf.</hi> 1 Cor. xvi. 22. R.V. “Maranatha,” with marginal note, “That is, our Lord cometh.”</note>




<note n="9.325.a">Hardly, I think, as Box “called upon <hi rend="italic">him.</hi>” Flaccus
is only accused here of not taking any steps to stop ti, cf. <hi rend="italic">Legatio</hi> 132 f. Later in § 53 a more active participation is suggested.</note>




<note n="9.327.a">As to what is implied by this word, see App. p. 533.</note>


<note n="9.327.b">Or district below the coastal strip (Box, see his note on
the geography). Mangey has “ora maritima.”</note>


<note n="9.327.c">Lit. “the most and most prosperous.” So in § 51 “the
most and most necessary,” and in <hi rend="italic">De Aet.</hi> 64 τὰ πλεῖστα καὶ μέγισστα τῶν ὀρῶν. Here Box gives “the most extensive and wealthiest,” and below “the greatest and most important.” I am not sure whether πλεῖστα can mean this and at any rate it does not fit in with <hi rend="italic">De Aet.</hi> 64. I think that in all three places it is a curious way of expressing “most of the wealthiest, greatest,” etc.</note>




<note n="9.328.1">It would perhaps be better to omit the marks of the
parenthesis, and put a colon or full stop at εὐχάριστον. In
this case we have the same anacoluthic γὰρ as in <hi rend="italic">De Aet.</hi> 75,
and the verb to which οἱ δὲ is subject is ἔμελλον. See note <hi rend="italic">b.</hi></note>



<note n="9.329.a">The thought here seems confused. The point in which
the Jews were unique is that they believed that the admission
of an image into a place of worship desecrated it, and assuming
as Philo does that εὐσέβεια can only be adequately shown
in a place of worship, they would be deprived of the means of showing it adequately. But the destruction of their temples would equally incapacitate Gentiles. But see App. p. 533.</note>


<note n="9.329.b">The sentence as punctuated here has no verb to the initial οἱ, unless καὶ at the end is taken = “also,” which seems pointless. If punctuated as suggested in note 1, there would be no objection to taking εἶπον as 1st person singular, which will fit in better with οὐκ οἶδα.</note>




<note n="9.330.1">MSS. ἀφιέντων or ἀφεθέντων.</note>



<note n="9.331.a">I take νομίμοις as a dative of the same kind as νόμῳ or
νόμοις corresponding to our own “by the law,” e.g. χρὴ θανεῖν
answered by ποίῳ νόμῳ; or οἰκεῖν τοῖς νόμοις. See other
examples in Stephanus. Box takes it after ὑποστέλλειν =
“shelter ourselves under the laws.”</note>


<note n="9.331.b">The sentence πλὴν . . . αἰτίους is very difficult, for (1) πλὴν
εἰ μὴ is pleonastic instead of either πλὴν εἰ or εἰ μὴ; (2) the
general sense seems to be “if we are to be blamed it is not
because we refused to break the law by admitting images, but
because we have not been strict enough in preventing defection”
(though what this alludes to is not clear); (3) τοὺς αἰτίους
must mean those who are responsible by having allowed the others to begin. But this is very forced (I am inclined to think that μὴ has dropped out as often in Philo, or that we should read ἀναιτίους); (4) assuming that τοὺς αἰτίους is right, what is meant by τελευτῶσι . . . εἰς? Perhaps “they at last come to practise them” (Box). Rather I think “they ultimately suffer from the consequences,” and perhaps the thought may be something like this: “If we had insisted more on the strict observance of the law in other matters, the Greeks would not have attempted to force this desecration upon us.”</note>




<note n="9.332.1">MSS. ἐν δυσὶν.</note>



<note n="9.333.a">As to what this proclamation actually meant, see App.
pp. 534 f. The only point which here emerges is that the
Jews were restricted to the one quarter (Delta, according to Josephus, <hi rend="italic">B.J.</hi> ii. 18. 8) which had been originally allotted to them. It did not of course formally sanction the pogrom which ensued. That Flaccus did not stop this was a <hi rend="italic">third</hi> wrong.</note>


<note n="9.333.b">Or perhaps “because most of the inhabitants are Jews,” i.e. there are also Gentiles.</note>




<note n="9.335.a">Gaius’s sister. She died on June 10th, which gives the
<hi rend="italic">terminus a quo</hi> for the attack. See also App. p. 535.</note>




<note n="9.337.a">For another account of the pogrom described in the next ten sections see <hi rend="italic">Legatio</hi> 119–131, where the violence is ascribed to the belief of the Alexandrians that Gaius hated the Jews, a point completely ignored here.</note>

<note n="9.339.a">See note on <hi rend="italic">Quod Omn. Prob.</hi> 123.</note>




<note n="9.341.a">Not to be translated “mimicked the sufferers,” even if
that is the outcome of what is said. The regular use of this
verb followed by the article with a noun or participle points
to what I have put. Thus in § 32 above we have τὸν ἑταῖρον
καὶ φίλον καθυπεκ., in <hi rend="italic">De Ios.</hi> 50 Potiphar’s wife accusing Joseph καθυπεκ. τὴν σώφρονα, <hi rend="italic">ibid.</hi> 166 Joseph to his brothers καθυπεκ. τὸν δυσχεραίνοντα. So also in this treatise with similar verbs ἐπιφάσκων τὸν πλούσιον § 130 and προσποιούμενος τὸν ἡδόμενον § 98. No doubt “pretended to be the sufferers” may mean “mimicked them,” but I should prefer to take it that they assumed the air of the injured parties, who were only inflicting a righteous punishment. This will give more point to ἀληθῶς, and if Box is right in his note on “mimes” (§ 34) that they emphasized the characteristic rather than the dramatic, it will be in accord with this view.</note>




<note n="9.343.a">The term γενάρχης elsewhere applied by Philo to founders
and heads of the nation (Abraham, the three Patriarchs, and
the Seventy Elders) here apparently=the technical word
ἐθνάρχης (cf. 2 Cor. xi. 32), the official who at Alexandria, at
any rate according to Strabo writing under Augustus, served
as general administrator and judge of the Jews.</note>


<note n="9.343.b">Or “elsewhere,” i.e. either in some other treatise or some
lost part of this. Reiter and others assume that this is the meaning of δι᾿ ἑτέρων and perhaps there are other places in Philo, not quoted by them nor observed by me, which go to prove that this is its meaning here. Failing such evidence, I should prefer to take it as above. The ἐπιβουλή may be either the pogrom in general or the treatment of the thirty-eight just described.</note>




<note n="9.345.a">It will be observed that this interview must have taken
place after the pillaging described in §§ 56 f. This suggests
the possibility that it was either the attitude there taken up by the magistrates or their failure to carry out the conditions there laid down which led to their arrest and punishment.</note>




<note n="9.346.1">Very possibly a gloss inserted in view of the words which
follow.</note>


<note n="9.346.2">Perhaps, as Mangey held, an insertion. The duplication
of the epithet, with no obvious point, is not like Philo.</note>


<note n="9.346.3">MSS. οὐδένα ἦν.</note>



<note n="9.347.a">Apparently the birthday of Gaius himself (Aug. 31st). <hi rend="italic">Cf.</hi> αὐτοκράτορος § 83.</note>




<note n="9.348.1">MSS. καταδικαζόμενοι.</note>



<note n="9.349.a">This elliptical phrase is principally cited from Herodotus,
κεκοσμημένον τὴν ἐπὶ θανάτῳ i. 109, συλλαβὼν δέ σφεας ἔδησε
τὴν ἐπὶ θανάτῳ iii. 119, and so with κατέδησαν v. 72. If this represents the facts it would seem to be a deliberate archaism in Philo. Lucian however also uses it (<hi rend="italic">Alex.</hi> 44).</note>




<note n="9.350.1">Wendland suggests πόσον, but see note c.</note>



<note n="9.351.a">The phrase τὸν ἐπ᾿ αἰχμαλώτοις is certainly strange, but
we have something like it in <hi rend="italic">De Ios.</hi> 184 τὸν ὡς ἐπὶ τεθνεῶτι
φόβον “the fear that he is dead,” though here to make the
parallel complete we should have a participle ἐσομένοις.</note>


<note n="9.351.b"><hi rend="italic">Cf. Spec. Leg.</hi> iii. 169 “The women are best suited to
the indoor life which keeps to the house, within which the middle door (μέσαυλον = θαλαμευόμεναι here) is taken by the maidens as their boundary, and the outer door by those who have reached full womanhood.” See note, vol. vii. p. 640. A good deal of additional information is given by Box.</note>


<note n="9.351.c">ὅσον exclamatory may be kept as more expressive than πόσον, <hi rend="italic">cf. e.g. Rep.</hi> 450 A οἷον . . . εἰργάσασθε! ὅσον λόγον . . . κινεῖτε!</note>




<note n="9.352.1">The word is hopeless. Of the corrections proposed, ἀνανέωσις and ἀναχώνευσις (“reforging”), the latter seems the more probable. Considering that it follows on ἀντὶ πολλῶν ὀλίγα, I should myself prefer ἀναπλήρωσιν to ἀνανέωσιν.</note>




<note n="9.354.1">Mangey, Reiter, etc., take this sentence as a question,
and Reiter inserts ἂν after ἀφῃρέθησαν. But see note <hi rend="italic">a</hi>.</note>



<note n="9.355.a">This sentence has been taken by other editors as a question
(ἂν being inserted after ἀφῃρέθησαν) and understood to
mean “if they had arms, would they have been stripped
of their homes?” This is quite good sense in itself, but what
bearing has it on the sequel? As I have taken it, the apodosis
is suppressed for the moment, but is understood from the next
sentence, i.e. “if they had arms, they must have passed into
the hands of those who occupied their houses.”</note>


<note n="9.355.b">So rather than “crowds,” for which Philo would use the singular; nor does it suit ἀπέλαυσαν so well. For the use cf. τὸ πλῆθος . . . ὄχλων καὶ θορύβων <hi rend="italic">De Mut.</hi> 144.</note>


<note n="9.355.c">Why does Philo bring this account of the women’s sufferings in at this point? They belong rather to the pogrom which we left at § 85. Possibly he means that the insult to feminine modesty involved in the investigation just described did not stand alone, though in the account of the atrocities nothing had been said about the women.</note>




<note n="9.356.1">MSS. ἡμῖν or ὑμῖν.</note>



<note n="9.357.a">The sections which follow describe events which go back
to a time previous to those narrated in § 25 and onwards.
Philo seems to take this action of Flaccus as his crowning wickedness, and very possibly connects it directly with his fall, perhaps justly. It is quite conceivable that when the insulted Agrippa informed the emperor that Flaccus had suppressed a complimentary address to himself, his animosity against Flaccus was roused to activity.</note>


<note n="9.357.b">Or “without adding to the multitude,” etc. But the dative of the thing known following σύνοιδα is not uncommon.</note>




<note n="9.358.1">MSS. ἐπίνοιαν.</note>



<note n="9.359.a">Or perhaps “perusal,” for διαγιγνώσκω is sometimes used
for διαναγιγνώσκω. Perhaps indeed read διανάγνωσιν, which
Mangey suggested and Box adopts.</note>


<note n="9.359.b">Literally “in the council chamber (or council) of his
lawless mind,” <hi rend="italic">cf. De Vit. Cont.</hi> 27. The figure it may be

In <hi rend="italic">De Dec.</hi> 91 we have καταστρατηγεῖς τὸν ὅρκον of making the oath which the judges have sworn of none effect.

<note n="9.381.a">Something like this must be the meaning of διακύπτω here and it is a fairly natural development from the original meaning of “stoop through.” But there is little authority for such a development, at any rate in Philo.

do not know what authority there is for this genitive after
ὀνειδίζω, and the “complete change” is hardly a matter for reproaches, which I should suppose were pointed against real or supposed misdeeds. If the translation is right the meaning is that the finger-pointing and reproaches affected him comparatively little, because the sense of ruin occupied his mind.</note>

ὑποτροπιάζω is a medical term which can be applied to the disease which recurs as in § 182, to the things (i.e. symptoms) which recur in diseases as here, and to the patient who relapses into his old disease (ἐπὶ τὴν ἀρχαίαν ὑποτροπιάσας νόσον) as in <hi rend="italic">De Mig.</hi> 150. The only slight difficulty is that καὶ, which brings out that new misfortunes remind us of the old, besides the actual misery which they give, should come before ὑποτροπ. ἀναγκ. instead of after it. But I do not think that Philo is very particular where he places his καί.</note>


<note n="9.387.b">Lit. “kept being swept down,” a phrase which would naturally suggest a rapid passage, the reverse of μόλις. Here “was swept about till he reached Peiraeus.”</note>

<note n="9.389.a">“Sons of daughters,” i.e. the sons of Julia by her second
husband M. Agrippa. These were C. Caesar, L. Caesar and
Agrippa Postumus, all of whom died young. As the eldest
would have been 58 at the time of Flaccus’s banishment, and the youngest 50, we get a hint of Flaccus’s age which is not, I think, found elsewhere.</note>


<note n="9.389.b">So perhaps rather than “city of refuge,” and so avoid the tautology with καταφυγήν. Elsewhere Philo uses the word only in reproducing the LXX of Num. xxxv. 12, etc, for the “Cities of Refuge.” But in dealing with φυγή he passes very easily from refuge to banishment, and the Cities themselves are regarded as places of exile in <hi rend="italic">De Fug.</hi> 100 f.</note>




<note n="9.391.a">Or “so violent was his emotion.” That is to say σφαδᾴζειν
in Philo nearly always suggests strong mental emotion, but does not necessarily imply that the violence has any special outward expression. See further App. p. 538.</note>




<note n="9.393.a">So perhaps simply, though the examples of ῥοπή=
“moment” without qualification are principally from the
LXX. Otherwise more exactly “by a momentary change in
what time brings,” i.e. in fortune. <hi rend="italic">Cf.</hi> καιρῶν ὀξείαις μεταβολαῖς
<hi rend="italic">De Post.</hi> 113.</note>


<note n="9.393.b">Clearly a reminiscence of the curse in Deut. xxviii. 67
“In the morning thou shalt say, Would God it were even! and at even thou shalt say, Would God it were morning!” See note on <hi rend="italic">De Praem.</hi> 151, where as here Philo takes the words which follow “for the sight of thine eyes which thou shalt see” to refer to the awful dreams seen by the accursed.</note>




<note n="9.395.a">Lit. “his peculiar fate.” οἰκεῖον seems pleonastic, but
expresses, perhaps, the feeling of one who asks “Why should
I in particular have this fate?” See however on <hi rend="italic">De Prov. 8.</hi></note>


<note n="9.395.b">The thought occurs also in <hi rend="italic">De Abr.</hi> 159 and <hi rend="italic">De Praem.</hi> 41. <hi rend="italic">Cf. De Aet.</hi> 4.</note>
