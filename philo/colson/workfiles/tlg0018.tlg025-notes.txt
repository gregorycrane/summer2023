<note n="8.164.3">I can hardly think that the text of these two lines is right.
φασὶν cannot = καλοῦσι, and εἶναι is required. This, which
could easily fall out after ἐμφέρειαν, might be supplied, but
the question would still remain whether the abstract noun
ἐμφέρεια can be used for the corresponding concrete as the
English “likeness” is. I should like to read and punctuate
ἣν θρασύτητα κυρίως ἂν προσαγορεύσειεν, ὥσπερ φασὶν ἐν τοῖς
νομίσμασι, τὸ παράσημον &lt;ἔχον&gt; ἐμφέρειαν τῆς ἀληθοῦς εἰκόνος.
See note <hi rend="italic">b.</hi></note>



<note n="8.165.a">Or if τῇ ψυχῇ is read, “the better part, the soul.” Cohn in his translation definitely adopts this, cf. § 30. The antithesis to σῶμα no doubt points to this, but it must be remembered that the idea that the mind or understanding is the better part of the ψυχή constantly recurs in Philo, and is emphasized below in § 187, cf. also § 85. Here it is particularly appropriate because the courage we are discussing belongs to ἐπιστήμη. I am inclined to retain the genitive.</note>


<note n="8.165.b">Or if the reading and punctuation in note 3 is adopted, “reckless daring,” the counterfeit (to use the term which we apply to coins) of the true type whose semblance it bears.</note>




<note n="8.167.a">Plato, <hi rend="italic">Laws</hi> 631 C. See note on <hi rend="italic">Spec. Leg.</hi> i. 25, vol. vii.
p. 615.</note>


<note n="8.167.b">The “wealth of <hi rend="italic">nature</hi>,” which is to be distinguished
from the spiritual wealth of wisdom (see § 8), is described
again in <hi rend="italic">De Praem.</hi> 99, <hi rend="italic">cf. De Som.</hi> i. 124 ff., where it is identified
with the “bread and raiment” for which Jacob prayed. Here Philo seems to allow it a place in the “seeing wealth” (see § 7), though elsewhere that is an epithet reserved for spiritual wealth. It guards the body against poverty, but not against the other bodily ills enumerated in §§ 10–15.</note>


<note n="8.167.c">The translation takes εὕρημα in the common sense of “godsend” or “prize.” Otherwise “the thing which nature discovers and gives.”</note>




<note n="8.169.a">For the triple division of philosophy see note on <hi rend="italic">Spec. Leg.</hi> i. 336 and the references there given.</note>


<note n="8.169.b">Or “as befits its assimilation,” i.e. it is part of the process
which the sage goes through in his endeavour to resemble
God. <hi rend="italic">Cf. Spec. Leg.</hi> iv. 188 and § 168 below.</note>


<note n="8.169.c">Or perhaps a stronger word as “glory,” i.e. in the eyes
of the wise, not a glory which implies celebrity. On the
contrary, the multitude are more likely to abuse such people. So in <hi rend="italic">De Sob.</hi> 57 the sage is not ἔνδοξος but εὐκλεής, where perhaps the translation “not merely of high report” may have missed the sense.</note>


<note n="8.169.d">More literally “picked out as the best,” an odd phrase here, since usually it refers to actual selection, <hi rend="italic">cf. e.g.</hi> § 42. That it does not mean this here nor imply that the multitude are apt to speak evil of dignities, but refers to the wise εὐκλεεῖς, is shown by τούτων κτλ. in the next sentence.</note>




<note n="8.171.a">Lit. “excels by the whole and all.” The addition of φασί suggests that the phrase is colloquial.</note>


<note n="8.171.b">For the triple division of the soul <hi rend="italic">cf. Spec. Leg.</hi> iv. 92
and note. In the “restive horses” there is an allusion to the
parable in Plato, <hi rend="italic">Phaedrus</hi> 253 D, where the charioteer is to be interpreted as reason, and the two horses as high spirit and desire, a parable interpreted in the same sense also by Philo, <hi rend="italic">Leg. All.</hi> i. 72 f.</note>

<note n="8.174.1">MSS. καὶ.</note>



<note n="8.175.a">It is difficult to see to what Philo refers (<hi rend="italic">cf. De Praem.</hi> 3).
Peace is of course the ordinary sphere of all the virtues except
ἀνδρεία, and nearly every event or law would come under this head. He has dealt with δικαιοσύνη in war in <hi rend="italic">Spec. Leg.</hi> iv. 219–222, and εὐσέβεια, which is quite as prominent as ἀνδρεία in the coming story of the Midianite war, might be found in the earlier account of that war in <hi rend="italic">Mos.</hi> i. 305 ff., or that against Amalek, <hi rend="italic">ibid.</hi> 215 ff. So too Abraham’s conduct of the war against the four kings is ascribed to φιλανθρωπία, <hi rend="italic">De Abr.</hi> 232.</note>




<note n="8.177.a">Here again the reference is vague. As ἀνδρεία in peace
has just been equated to ἀτυφία, we should expect Philo to
say that he has just discussed it, but the reference to Moses’
frequent insistence on it suggests something different.</note>


<note n="8.177.b">Deut. xx. 8 “What man is there who fears and is cowardly
in his heart? let him go and return to his house, lest he make
the heart of his brother cowardly as is his own.” Actually
this is spoken on the battlefield by the “officers” (E.V.), for
which the LXX has γραμματεῖς (“scribes”), a word which may
have influenced Philo in connecting the exemption with
drawing up the roll.</note>


<note n="8.177.c">Or “makes a powerful impression on.” The metaphor, as in other compounds of μάττομαι, is taken from the copy produced by stamping wax. Perhaps “infect,” though a different metaphor, will give the sense more vividly in English.</note>


<note n="8.177.d">A somewhat inadequate translation for ἀγωνία which is defined by Diogenes Laertius as φόβος ἀδήλου πράγματος. See note on <hi rend="italic">De Dec.</hi> 145 (vol. vii. p. 612).</note>


<note n="8.177.e">καταφρονητικῶς here denotes scorn for the feebleness of the enemy. Elsewhere, as in § 43 below, scorn of danger, <hi rend="italic">cf. Spec. Leg.</hi> iii. 126.</note>




<note n="8.178.1">MSS. στρατηγοῖς (-οὺς).</note>


<note n="8.178.2">All MSS. φιλανθρωπίαν ὁμοῦ except A which has φιλανθρώπως
ὁμοῦ. Cohn, adopting a suggestion of Wendland’s, prints
φιλανθρώπως ὁμοῦ &lt;καὶ στρατηγικῶς&gt;. This is based on the
paraphrase in Clem. Alex. <hi rend="italic">Strom.</hi> ii. 18, who after mentioning
the circumstances which entitle to exemption goes on τούτους
ἀφεῖσθαι τῆς στρατείας ὁ φιλάνθρωπος κελεύει νόμος στρατηγικῶς
μὲν (then follows a précis of the reasons mentioned in § 31),
φιλανθρώπως δὲ (then the reasons mentioned in § 29). The
text thus emended seems to me in itself unsatisfactory. If
εὑρισκόμενος agrees with the subject of ἀφείσθω, the adverbs
are unnatural. It is the law, not the man, who acts φιλανθρώπως
καὶ στρατηγικῶς. If with the subject of φησί, the
participle has an unnatural sense. The law does not “win” or “discover” ἄδεια. I think that Cohn and Wendland must have failed to observe that φιλανθρωπίαν ὁμοῦ may be a misdivision of φιλανθρωπία (= -ᾳ) νόμου, and that it actually is so is strongly supported by <hi rend="italic">Spec. Leg.</hi> ii. 183, where M, the one existing MSS., has τὴν μετουσίαν ἔλαβον φιλανθρωπίαν ὁμοῦ δοθεῖσαν, which editors have corrected as an obvious error to φιλανθρωπίᾳ νόμου. I do not think Clement’s phrase can outweigh this. See App. p. 442.</note>



<note n="8.179.a">Deut. xx. 5–7. For a comparison of the treatment of these verses here given with that of <hi rend="italic">De Agr.</hi> 148 if. see App. p. 441.</note>




<note n="8.180.1">MSS. ἀνευρισκόμενος.</note>


<note n="8.180.2">Perhaps, as Mangey, οὐ δέον. See App. p. 442.</note>


<note n="8.180.3">All MSS. except A have τῶν κατὰ. Perhaps, since ἔσεσθαι is to be expected with χρηστὰ as predicate, read χρῆσιν τῶν.</note>


<note n="8.180.4"><hi rend="italic">Cf.</hi> § 3. Whereas there the MSS. have τῆς ψυχῆς, here they vary between ψυχῆς and ψυχῆ ( = -ῇ). See note <hi rend="italic">a.</hi></note>


<note n="8.180.5">MSS. οἰκουρεῖ.</note>



<note n="8.181.a">Or if ψυχῆς is read (see note 4), “the better part of the soul.” There is certainly a presumption in favour of consistency between § 3 and here, but perhaps it is of some weight that there the quality indicated is λογισμός; here it is rather θυμός, which is or may be part of the lower soul.</note>




<note n="8.182.1">The text here is very uncertain. The majority of MSS.
have φέρει τι κηραινούση πάθος ψυχῆ ( = -ῇ). Some however have
εἰ φέρει, or εἰ φέροι, or φέρειν. While I have printed and
translated Cohn’s correction of φθερεῖ for φέρει, and κηραινούσης
ψυχῆς for the dative of the MSS., I do not think it satisfactory.
φθερεῖ is not an appropriate word for the effect of the diseased
soul upon the body, nor a proper analogy to the preceding
clause. I think the key to the sentence may be found in
understanding οὐκ ὄφελος from the preceding clause. οὐκ
ὄφελος can be used indifferently with the nominative and
genitive, and if the change of cases from παντευχίας to σῶμα
is an objection, παντευχία might be read for παντευχίας. Assuming this, I suggest εἰ φέρει τι κηραίνουσα πάθος ψυχὴ or περί τι κηραινούσῃ πάθος ψυχῇ. This last does not so well account for the persistence of φέρει in the MSS., but otherwise fits in admirably with Philo’s use of κηραίνω. <hi rend="italic">Cf. De Praem.</hi> 121 κηραίνοντα περὶ μηδὲν πάθος; <hi rend="italic">Spec. Leg.</hi> i. 260 ἵνα περὶ μηδὲν πάθος κηραίνωσι, and other examples of κηραίνειν περί. In fact with the exception of changing φέρει to περὶ it follows the MSS.. exactly. On ἣν ἀδυνατοῦν ἀπορρίψει see App. p. 443.</note>



<note n="8.183.a">These two sections have no reference to the text of Deuteronomy, which does not suggest any such selection, but are based on the selection mentioned below in § 42. For the principles of that selection Philo draws on his imagination.</note>




<note n="8.184.1">My correction. Cohn prints ἐφ᾿ ὧν ἀπογνῶσι, which is
quite impossible. Some MSS. have ἐπειδὰν for ἐφ᾿ ὧν, which
will give a grammatical construction. But Philo does not
seem to use ἀπογιγνώσκω with the genitive. I see no difficulty
in the text as printed above: ἐφ᾿ ὧν = ἐπὶ τούτων ἐφ᾿ ὧν, i.e. in
circumstances in which there is no hope of salvation.</note>



<note n="8.185.a">For the narrative which follows see Num. xxv. 1–18 and
xxxi. 1–18 and compare the parallel account in <hi rend="italic">Mos.</hi> i. 295–311.
There the seduction by the women is equally prominent,
but the details are given in the form of advice tendered by Balaam to Balak, against whom the war is waged, the Midianites not being mentioned. Here Balaam is not mentioned, nor is Phinehas. For the relation of Philo’s account to the biblical see App. p. 443.</note>


<note n="8.185.b">Or “laid down snares.” See App. p. 444.</note>


<note n="8.185.c">For this use of θανατάω, as against the accepted meaning of “desire to die,” see note on <hi rend="italic">Spec. Leg.</hi> iii. 102 (vol. vii. p. 636).</note>




<note n="8.186.1">My correction for MSS. περιοῦσαι or περαιώσει. Cohn, who
prints τὴν νίκην οἴσει, admits (<hi rend="italic">Hermes</hi>, 1908, p. 212) that he
prints it merely to have an intelligible text, and that neither
it nor the suggestions of περιποιήσει or περιοίσει are satisfactory.
I think that, as the point indicated is something over and above victory, πέρα is very probable, but other arrangements are possible, as τὴν νίκην &lt;νίκης δὲ&gt; πέρα οἴσει. πέρα (preposition) often follows its case.</note>




<note n="8.188.1">So Cohn for MSS. ἐπάδων = ἐπᾴδων. Wendland ἐπαίρων.
As all MSS. except S omit ἐπαντλῶν, several have ταῖς ψυχαῖς,
and some of these omit τούτοις, the simple form of text τοῖς
ὠσὶ τὰ ὑπὲρ εὐσεβείας δόγματα καὶ ταῖς ψυχαῖς τῶν ὑπηκόων
ἐπᾴδων may be worth considering. <hi rend="italic">Cf.</hi> Plato, <hi rend="italic">Phaedo</hi> 114 MSS.
χρὴ τὰ τοιαῦτα ἐπᾴδειν ἑαυτῷ.</note>



<note n="8.189.a">Though here the libations are of a ritual kind, the word
is so bound up with the idea of a truce that the antithesis is a natural one. <hi rend="italic">Cf.</hi> ἐν σπονδαῖς ἄσπονδα ἔπαθον, <hi rend="italic">Spec. Leg.</hi> iii. 96 and note.</note>


<note n="8.189.b">Num. xxv. 9. Philo, who in <hi rend="italic">Mos.</hi> i. 303 f. took the “plague” of the Hebrew (LXX πληγή) to be a slaughter, does not commit himself here to either view. See note on <hi rend="italic">Mos.</hi> i. 304, and in App. (vol. vi. pp. 603 f.).</note>


<note n="8.189.c">Or perhaps “persuading them to follow these” (if ἐπάγων is read).</note>




<note n="8.190.1">MSS. ἐν ᾗ.</note>



<note n="8.191.a">In <hi rend="italic">Mos.</hi> i. 311 the boys also are spared, contrary to
Num. xxxi. 17, “slay every male” (though the LXX does not
add as the Hebrew “among the little ones”). Philo does
not here contradict his statement in the earlier book, nor indeed even suggest that the men outside the fighting force were put to death.</note>


<note n="8.191.b"><hi rend="italic">Cf. Mos.</hi> i. 309. The statement is based on Num. xxxi. 49 “and there lacketh not one of us,” which does not imply that none of them were wounded. He says the same in <hi rend="italic">De Mut.</hi> 109, where he quotes the LXX οὐ διαπεφώνηκεν ἀπ᾿ αὐτῶν οὐδὲ εἷς, and he may be right in giving this meaning to διαφωνεῖν. See App. p. 444.</note>




<note n="8.192.1">MSS. ἐλαττωθέντες, -θέντος, -θεῖσαν, -θῆναι. The last is the
form accepted by Mangey, but this would perhaps require
μηδὲ for μήτε, and Coh0n’s correction best satisfies grammar.</note>


<note n="8.192.2">MSS. ἀεὶ . . . περιέχεται.</note>



<note n="8.193.a">Presumably intended as a definite name for Deuteronomy,
though see <hi rend="italic">De Fug.</hi> 170. For the variant παραινέσεις see <hi rend="italic">Spec. Leg.</hi> iv. 131. The next two sections are a loose paraphrase of Deut. xxviii. 1, 2, and 7, though the promise of peace belongs rather to Lev. xxvi. 5. <hi rend="italic">Cf. Be Praem.</hi> 93.</note>


<note n="8.193.b">i.e. and therefore naturally seized by the invader where possible—so, I think, rather than the ordinary meaning of the word “easily assailed,” which Cohn gives. Mangey’s translation “nec facile oppugnanda” cannot of course be got out of the word.</note>




<note n="8.194.1">Cohn at this point prints asterisks to indicate that the
treatise Περὶ εὐσεβείας originally stood here. See General
Introduction p. x.</note>


<note n="8.194.2">MSS. περαιοῦσθαι.</note>



<note n="8.195.a">This seems to be the best word to describe the virtue in
general, though there is of course a multitude of cases where the action described would be said to show benevolence or kindness or charity rather than what we should call humanity.</note>

<note n="8.198.1">MSS. ποιμένος or ποιούμενος.</note>


<note n="8.198.2">So all MSS. except S, which has ἐπ᾿ ὄρους. Cohn in his
edition corrected to σπορὰς, considering that ποίμνη σποράδην
was an impossible combination and that ἐπ᾿ ὄρους was a
corruption of σπορὰς. In his translation he declares for
σπορὰς ἐπ᾿ ὄρους. He observes that “on a mountain” is a
reminiscence of 1 Kings xxii. 17 “I saw all Israel scattered on the mountains, as a flock which has no shepherd.” No doubt this is so, but whether the reminiscence is more likely to be Philo’s or of the scribe of S, I do not feel capable of deciding. In any case I see no reason for substituting σπορὰς for σποράδην, which as an adverb qualifying ἀγελάρχην οὐκ ἔχουσα seems to me quite unobjectionable.</note>



<note n="8.199.a">Num. xxvii. 16, 17.</note>


<note n="8.199.b">So LXX. E.V. “spirits of all flesh,”</note>


<note n="8.199.c">Or “waste away.”</note>




<note n="8.201.a">An allusion to Wisdom’s speech in Prov. viii. 22–30
“The Lord . . . established me from eternity (πρὸ τοῦ αἰῶνος),
in the beginning before He made the earth,” etc., part of
which Philo has quoted in <hi rend="italic">De Ebr.</hi> 31.</note>


<note n="8.201.b">See γοῦν in previous section, suggesting that the following words illustrate the general sense of the paragraph.</note>




<note n="8.203.a">Num. xxvii. 22, 23.</note>




<note n="8.205.a">Deut. xxxi. 7 and 23.</note>


<note n="8.205.b">τὸ φιλάλληλον = “mutual affection,” when applied to

<note n="8.205.c">Num. xxvii. 19 “Thou shalt give him a charge before all the congregation.”</note>


<note n="8.205.d">Cohn takes κανὼν καὶ νόμος as predicate, “he should become a law.” Who then is “he”? Not Joshua, for Moses, who advises his successor, is the model. Not Moses, for Philo would have said αὐτὸν ἀποβλέπουσι. I take the words as subject to γένηται.</note>




<note n="8.206.1">Perhaps ἔλεγχοι &lt;οἱ&gt; to balance the articles with the
corresponding nouns that follow.</note>



<note n="8.207.a">For the song of Moses see Deut. xxxii. 1–43.</note>


<note n="8.207.b">Verse 43 (in LXX only) “Rejoice ye heavens with Him, and let all the angels of God worship Him.”</note>

but not certain emendation.</note>


<note n="8.208.3">Cohn considers this section spurious, probably rightly.
See App. p. 445.</note>



<note n="8.209.a">The song, according to Deut. xxxi. 28, was intended to be a witness against Israel, and certainly the “arraignments” are the most prominent feature. On the other hand “the poem strikes its keynote (xxxii. 21) of mercy and hope, and emphatically concludes on this keynote” (34–43)—Adam Smith.</note>


<note n="8.209.b">For the blessing of Moses see Deut. xxxiii. Philo has before, in <hi rend="italic">Mos.</hi> ii. 288, expressed his conviction that these blessings, though partially fulfilled already, would be finally completely fulfilled.</note>




<note n="8.211.a">Ex. xxii. 25, Lev. xxv. 36, 37, Deut. xxiii. 19. <hi rend="italic">Cf. Spec.
Leg.</hi> ii. 74 ff.</note>


<note n="8.211.b">Or simply “interest on money”; but there is obviously an allusion to the original meaning of τόκος.</note>




<note n="8.213.a">Philo may have extracted an injunction to give in preference
to lending even without interest from Lev. XXV. 35, where “thou shalt help” thy poor brother precedes the prohibition of interest, or Deut. xv. 10 “thou shalt surely give to him and thou shalt lend.”</note>




<note n="8.215.a">The translation takes τῶν πολυχρύσων. . . βασιλέων in
apposition with ὀβολοστατῶν καὶ τοκογλύφων. So also Mangey.
Cohn, on the other hand, takes them as dependent on ἐν
λόγῳ, and understands the passage “we must regard the
usurers as on a par with the kings (such as the Great King),
who are no real kings.” But this ignores the ironical use of
the interrogation ἔτι τοίνυν as a triumphant way of stating
that something can no longer be held, e.g. §141, and which
Cohn himself seems to have recognized by printing the
sentence as a question. For the absolute use of ἐν λόγῳ cf.
οὔτ᾿ ἐν λόγῳ, <hi rend="italic">De Praem.</hi> 111. A slightly different way of
taking the passage would be to treat τῶν . . . βασιλέων as
genitive absolute, “can the usurers be of any account, when
the richest kings are shown to have no true wealth?”</note>


<note n="8.215.b">This censure is based on Lev. XXV. 37 “nor give (A.V.
lend) him thy victuals for increase.” XXV. ἐπὶ πλεονασμῷ.</note>


<note n="8.215.c">Or as we might say colloquially “you won’t catch these people giving away to beggars.” Cohn, who translates ταχύ γ’ by “vielleicht,” and supposes the words to mean “perhaps they would give to beggars so as to get profit from them,” misses the meaning of ταχύ. It is here used like σπουδῇ γε in an ironical way, which, though ignored by L. &amp; S., is well illustrated in Stephanus, who gives several references to the orators, <hi rend="italic">e.g. Dem.</hi> 798. 20 ὃς γὰρ οἷς ὁ δῆμος ἅπας . . . νουθετεῖ μηδεπώποθ᾿ ὑπεῖξε . . . ταχύ γ᾿ ἂν φροντίσειε τοῦ παρ᾿
ἑνὸς λόγου.</note>


<note n="8.215.d">Lev. xix. 13, Deut. xxiv. 14, 15, <hi rend="italic">cf. Spec. Leg.</hi> iv. 195. Philo considers that this and other repetitions are covered by the defence given in <hi rend="italic">ibid.</hi> 204, and it is true that in his earlier notice of the law he did not dwell on the effect on the worker.</note>




<note n="8.216.1">So S. Other MSS. ἐφήμερος. See note <hi rend="italic">a</hi></note>



<note n="8.217.a">Or “as some persons (i.e. writers) have said.” The
singular ὡς εἶπέ τις generally, if not always, in Philo indicates
a quotation. Mangey “ut quidem docent,” referring it
apparently to the view that a manual worker is like a beast
of burden. If ἐφήμερος is read instead of the otherwise unknown ἐφημερόβιος, I should suspect a play on the poetic use of the word (e.g. Aesch. <hi rend="italic">Prom.</hi> 83) for mankind in general as “creatures of a day.” The manual worker is “for a day” in the literal sense.</note>


<note n="8.217.b">Deut. xxiv. 10, 11.</note>


<note n="8.217.c">Lev. xix. 9, xxiii. 22. E.V. “Thou shalt not reap the corners of the field.” LXX “Ye shall not complete the reaping.”</note>




<note n="8.219.a">Lev. xix. 10 (cf. Deut. xxiv. 21) “Thou shalt not glean
thy vineyard, neither shalt thou gather the fallen fruit of
thy vineyard.” The LXX for “fallen fruit” has ῥῶγας, which
in itself only means “grapes” or “berries.” Philo explains
it by adding ἀποπίπτουσας. Josephus, <hi rend="italic">Ant.</hi> iv. 231 gives for
it τὰς ἐπιφυλλίδας (small grapes?).</note>


<note n="8.219.b">Deut. xxiv. 20.</note>


<note n="8.219.c">Or perhaps “wearing themselves out to death.” Philo has used this word which in other writers seems to mean “struggle against death” of the craze for the theatre, <hi rend="italic">Mos.</hi> ii. 211, and the despair of the Israelites pursued by Pharaoh, <hi rend="italic">ibid.</hi> 250.</note>




<note n="8.221.a">The law of first fruits has been given in full in <hi rend="italic">Spec. Leg.</hi>

<note n="8.223.a">Deut. xxii. 1. LXX “When thou seest the calf of thy
brother or his sheep wandering in the way, do not overlook
them; thou shalt surely turn them back to thy brother and
restore them.”</note>


<note n="8.223.b"><hi rend="italic">Ibid.</hi> xxii. 2 “And if thy brother do not come nigh to
thee and thou dost not know him, thou shalt bring it to thy house, and they shall be with thee until thy brother seek for them and thou shalt restore them to him.”</note>


<note n="8.223.c">Ex. xxiii. 10, 11, Lev. xxv. 3 if. The subject has been treated very fully in <hi rend="italic">Spec. Leg.</hi> ii. 86–109, and the last six of these sections dwell on the same aspect of the law, on which he insists here. We can here find less excuse than usual for the repetition.</note>




<note n="8.224.1">So Mangey for MSS. πενίᾳ. This, though retained by
Cohn, is hardly compatible with οὐ θέμις κολάζεσθαι. The
punishment cannot be punished. The poverty here spoken
of is not that to come if their property is not restored, but
that which they have undergone. Cohn while printing πενίᾳ
would like to add μακρᾷ from the paraphrase of Clement,
which I think he misunderstands. See App. p. 445.</note>

<note n="8.226.1">Perhaps read συμφυεῖς. See note <hi rend="italic">b.</hi></note>



<note n="8.227.a">Lev. xix. 33, 34. LXX “The stranger (προσήλυτος) that
comes to you shall be as the native (αὐτόχθων) among you, and
thou shalt love him as thyself, because you were strangers
(προσήλυτοι) in the land of Egypt.” Philo ignores the obvious
fact that the last clause shows that proselytes in his sense are
not intended. <hi rend="italic">Cf.</hi> Deut. x. 19.</note>


<note n="8.227.b">The translation accepts the LXX συμφυές, but I should
prefer to read συμφυεῖς, “united in a common nature.” It is
they, not the ζῷον, which are rendered συμφυεῖς by the fellowship.</note>


<note n="8.227.c">Philo may be alluding to the laws which give the stranger (1) enjoyment of the sabbath (fourth commandment), (2) right to eat the passover if circumcised (Ex. xii. 48), (3) share in the cities of refuge (Num. xxxv. 15), (4) in offering sacrifices (Num. xv. 14–16). They are included in the covenant (Deut. xxix. 11), in reading the law (Deut. xxxi. 12), in the gleaning left to the poor (Lev. xix. 10), and the “meat” provided by the sabbatical year (Lev. xxv. 6).</note>


<note n="8.227.d">Philo here distinguishes between the “incomers” or “proselytes,” and the μέτοικοι, who are not at any rate in the first instance co-religionists. Apparently this is based on the different tone in Deut. xxiii., from which he quotes lower down, excluding some races from the congregation altogether and admitting others only in a later generation.</note>

<note n="8.233.d">Lit. “coming upon us about the same things,” i.e. the fortunes of our neighbours. Cohn takes τῶν αὐτῶν as masculine.</note>




<note n="8.235.a">Ex. xxiii. 4. Philo rightly distinguishes this law from that of Deut. xxii. 1, which is concerned with a “brother’s” animal, and has been treated in § 96.</note>




<note n="8.236.1">The MSS. vary between this and προβολῆς, περιβολῆς,
παραβολῆς, and one has δουλείας. See note <hi rend="italic">c</hi>.</note>


<note n="8.236.2">So Cohn after S. Other MSS. πρὸ τῶν, πρὸς τὸν (in both
cases omitting ἢ), and ἢ τοῖς τρόπον. This last seems to me
to be preferable to that of S. The persons who acquired
slaves in some other way than as payment of a debt are not
creditors.</note>



<note n="8.237.a">These no doubt are the same as those mentioned in <hi rend="italic">Spec.
Leg.</hi> ii. 79, who according to the command in Lev. xxv. 39, 40
(which Philo there has in mind, rather than as stated in the
footnote Deut. xv. 12) are to be regarded as μισθωτοί. But
the relations of these to the debtors next mentioned are puzzling. For a discussion of this and some other points, or perhaps rather a statement of the questions that arise, see App. p. 446.</note>


<note n="8.237.b">If this is right, and the reference is to loans which the borrower expects and promises to pay shortly, it is an unusual sense for the word, though it is applied to brief and shortlived men and things.</note>


<note n="8.237.c">Lit. “the attack” or “visitation,” again a strange use. All that can be said is that it is even less possible to give a satisfactory meaning to the variants mentioned in note 1. What the “name” and “painfulness” are that are entailed by it is also obscure. Possibly δοῦλος and δουλεία. See also App. p. 446.</note>




<note n="8.238.1">Mangey wished to read ἀενάου, and Cohn in his translation
approved. But εὐμενής applied to things is common
enough, e.g. to air, plants, and even to the water of a river
(Aeschylus). See examples in Stephanus.</note>


<note n="8.238.2">So one MS. The others τινος χρηστοῦ, which Cohn retained,
but in his translation accepted τι χρηστόν. The genitive of
the thing drawn as opposed to the source from which it is
drawn seems hardly possible.</note>



<note n="8.239.a">Deut. xxiii. 15, 16 “Thou shalt not deliver to his master
a servant who coming (E.V. which is escaped) from his master has joined himself to thee. He shall dwell with thee, he shall dwell among you, wherever it pleaseth him. Thou shalt not afflict him.” Philo interprets this ordinance, which is supposed to apply to a slave escaping from a foreign master, in accordance with Attic law. See App. p. 447.
By ἐκ τριγονίας he does not mean, as Heinemann, <hi rend="italic">Bildung</hi>, p. 344, seems to suppose, to limit this privilege to slaves of the third generation. Hitherto the ordinances he mentions have applied to others who are born free (οἱ μὴ γένει δοῦλοι, § 123). This privilege extends to those who have no such claim. The μέν is in antithesis to a suppressed statement that <hi rend="italic">a fortiori</hi> those who are not born in slavery would be entitled to the same.</note>




<note n="8.240.1">Cohn following Mangey brackets ψυχῆς, but though the
double genitives are awkward, it seems wanted as an antithesis
to γαστρὸς. The expression anyhow is confused, as it is not
the ἀηδία but the meal which causes it which is ἔκτοπος and
παρηλλαγμένη.</note>



<note n="8.241.a">Lev. xxii. 27 “A calf or sheep or goat, whenever it is born, it shall be seven days under its dam, and on the eighth day and beyond it shall be accepted for gifts, for a burnt offering unto the Lord.” Ex. xxii. 30 is to the same effect, though only of the firstborn. Assuming that it is humanity which excludes from the altar, Philo might fairly argue that still more would it prohibit them for ordinary eating.</note>




<note n="8.242.1">Cohn punctuates with προτέρα to the second σιτίον as a
parenthesis, thus making προνοίᾳ follow on ἠτοιμάσατο, an
unnecessarily unwieldy parenthesis. προνοίᾳ easily follows on
ἄρδουσα with equally good sense.</note>



<note n="8.243.a">Lit. “is always lying in wait at different times,” a confused
expression which may mean as translated above, or that it sometimes takes the form of hunger and sometimes of thirst.</note>


<note n="8.243.b">For these three sections <hi rend="italic">cf. Spec. Leg.</hi> iii. 108 ff. As there, in the absence of any direct prohibition of infanticide, Philo argues its wickedness from the criminality ascribed to causing a miscarriage, so here from the mercy shown by the law to new-born animals.</note>




<note n="8.245.a">Lev. xxii. 28.</note>




<note n="8.247.a">As there is no such prohibition in the law, Philo must
mean that it follows logically from the law against killing
mother and offspring at the same time. According to Heinemann,
<hi rend="italic">Bildung</hi>, p. 37, the Rabbis had no such rule, but may
it not have been an accepted or at least a widely acknowledged
principle in Philo’s time?</note>


<note n="8.247.b">The argument in this and the next sections seem to be—the
unborn child is only potentially a separate creature. This
is a scientific principle (<hi rend="italic">cf. Spec. Leg.</hi> iii. 117 f. and note,
vol. vii. p. 637), but Moses by forbidding it to be killed, as it would be if animals were killed when pregnant, teaches us that it is still more sacred when born. In this way he is restraining the licence, primarily of those who practise infanticide, but also (§ 140) of all who disregard the rights and interests of others. It is difficult, however, to see the point of the sentence πάντων γὰρ . . . κτείνειν. I should like to think that it is the interpolation of a glossator.</note>




<note n="8.248.1">Inserted by Cohn from Clement, who repeats this clause
almost verbatim. (Possibly, however, an addition by Clement;
Philo may have thought that φιλανθρωπία in itself expressed
the antithesis.)</note>

here is the same and the moral also, with the difference that there the judge is admonished to do justice to the low-born, here all are encouraged to show kindness to men of other nations, meaning mainly no doubt the proselytes, consideration for whom figures so much throughout this treatise.</note>




<note n="8.254.1">Cohn writes περιουσίᾳ ζῇ δὲ—a strange position for δὲ.
On the other hand περιουσιάζω seems to be constructed with
the dative. Most MSS. have simply ζῇ. Perhaps read ζῇ δὲ
μὴ μόνον &lt;ἀπὸ&gt; τῶν ἀναγκαίων.</note>



<note n="8.255.a">The argument in these sections, 149–154, is very involved.
They are all based on Deut. xx. 19, which forbids cutting
down the fruit trees in an enemy’s country (<hi rend="italic">cf. Spec. Leg.</hi>
iv. 226 f.). The verse “Is the tree a man that it should be
besieged by thee?” (i.e. trees are innocent things) applies to
fruit trees under all circumstances and therefore forbids mischievous maltreatment of them (§ 149). This applies <hi rend="italic">even</hi> to trees in an enemy’s country, where if anywhere it might be thought justifiable (§ 150), and here besides the general argument of the innocence of plants (§ 150 and again § 154) there is a further reason, which has nothing to do with the main point, viz. that when peace is restored we shall regret that such a devastation leaves a feeling of resentment (§§ 151–153).</note>




<note n="8.257.a">Or perhaps “a sad pity,” “a painful thing,” i.e. to ourselves,
which will agree better with the interpretation of
ταμιευσαμένους given in the next note.</note>


<note n="8.257.b"><hi rend="italic">Prima facie</hi> the natural way of taking ταμιευσαμένους is
in agreement with φίλους, “to deprive our (potential) friends
of necessaries, who thereby lay nothing by,” etc. So Cohn
and Mangey, and no doubt this makes good sense in itself.
But it has no bearing on the sequel, which repeating the verb
ταμιεύομαι dwells on the need of providing for the time when
we should be on friendly terms and regret if we have done
anything which could prevent this. Grammatically ταμιευσαμένους can agree just as well with the subject of ἀποστερεῖν as with φίλους. By conducting war humanely we lay up something to serve us in time of peace—a fine and sagacious thought.</note>


<note n="8.257.c">See App. p. 448.</note>


<note n="8.257.d">Or “which becomes part of himself.” The meaning as I understand it is that actions of kindness affect a man’s nature and give him something to fall back upon.</note>




<note n="8.258.1">So Cohn from S ἀληπτικὴν. The other MSS. ἄληπτον γῆν.
Mangey proposed ἀθλητικὴν.</note>



<note n="8.259.a">Or “as means of sustenance,” meaning presumably as
in § 149 that the fruits become necessaries in times of dearth,
but are delicacies at other times.</note>


<note n="8.259.b">If the text is right the meaning may be as translated, or
perhaps as Cohn “the strength which trains or equips.” But
it is also possible to take τὴν ἀλειπτικὴν (<hi rend="italic">sc.</hi> τέχνην) as accusative
of respect after ἀγαθῷ = “good at training.”</note>


<note n="8.259.c">Lev. xix. 23 (for the allegorical treatment <hi rend="italic">cf. De Plant</hi>. 95). E.V. “Ye shall count the fruit thereof as their uncircumcision.” But LXX “Ye shall purge away its uncleanness,” which vague hint Philo develops into the horticultural operations which follow. His main point, however, that the fruit is not to be plucked till the fourth year, is scriptural.</note>




<note n="8.260.1">Cohn (in translation) wished to insert ἔσεσθαι. Mangey
proposed χθαμαλοῦσθαι for χαμαίζηλα. See note <hi rend="italic">a</hi>.</note>



<note n="8.261.a">Cohn translates “because the young plants injured thereby
and prevented from growing up would rise too little above
the ground,” thus taking βλάπτεσθαι as a participle, and
χαμαίζηλα = χαμαίζηλα ἔσεσθαι. Mangey seems also to connect
χαμαίζηλα with ἔμελλεν by his χθαμαλοῦσθαι. But the version
given above, which takes βλάπτεσθαι with ἔμελλε, seems to
present no difficulty. Why picking the fruit should have
this result remains unexplained in either version. The next
section suggests that he means that the fruit should not be allowed to grow to a stage in which it could be picked for enjoyment.</note>


<note n="8.261.b">βαθύνω here intransitive as in <hi rend="italic">De Post</hi>. 118. This use is not noted in Stephanus, and in L. &amp; S. revised quoted only from Philo.</note>

The fine turn he gives to it here is an example of his utilizing any valuable sense of which the words are capable.</note>




<note n="8.267.a">i.e. “at producing them in others.” περιέχομαι in the

<note n="8.268.1">Τhe MSS. here are exceedingly confused, and Cohn’s
reconstruction here given is doubtful. He also inserts ὡς
before ἀθεραπεύτως, necessarily perhaps if ἐπιτάσει is to be
taken with πνέοντας. The translation takes it as causal with
ἀθεραπεύτως ἔχοντας. μέγα or μέγαλα πνεῖν is often used
absolutely, sometimes to express influence, sometimes pride.

<note n="8.269.b">Cohn considers the whole description of the arrogant man to be an obvious allusion to the emperor Gaius. <hi rend="italic">Cf. Leg. ad Gaium</hi> 75 “he claimed to remain no more within the limits of human nature, but soared above them desiring to be thought a god.” It seems to me rather unnecessary even if it can be verified chronologically.</note>

<note n="8.273.a">Or “the character which God loves.” But here perhaps,

“friendship with God.”</note>

<note n="8.276.1">MSS. καὶ.</note>


<note n="8.276.2">This insertion is borne out by the form in which the same
text is quoted in <hi rend="italic">De Mut.</hi> 237 and <hi rend="italic">De Praem.</hi> 80. Deuteronomy
itself has only “heaven and beyond the sea.”</note>


<note n="8.276.3">Cohn declares αὐτὸς αἱρεῖται to be corrupt and in his
translation follows the correction ἄλλοθι εἴρηται “as has been
said elsewhere,” i.e. in <hi rend="italic">De Dec.</hi> 37, where Philo explains the
use of the second person singular in the commandment as
intended to show that one good person is equal in worth to a whole nation. But this lesson can equally be drawn from the text he is quoting here “He hath chosen <hi rend="italic">thee</hi> to be a people,” and I believe that αἱρεῖται at any rate is right. The phrase as it stands is an obscure, though perhaps not impossible, way of expressing what I have translated it by, but the change of καθάπερ into καθ᾿ ὅπερ would make it feasible. For other possible emendations see App. p. 448.</note>



<note n="8.277.a">Philo forgets to say that the correspondence must be one for good. In <hi rend="italic">De Mut.</hi> 237 f., where he gives the same exposition of the text, he brings this out clearly.</note>


<note n="8.277.b">Deut xxvi. 17, 18. E.V. for “chosen” has “avouched.”</note>


<note n="8.277.c">See note 3.</note>




<note n="8.278.1">So one MS. S has καὶ τοῖς, the others τοῖς δὲ. The
point has some bearing on the connexion of these two
treatises. See Gen. Introd. p. xvii.</note>



<note n="8.279.a">εἰ is here used causally, as often with words expressing
indignation, etc. Philo does not state what is to come in the second place. The thought is perhaps that this in itself is sufficient, in which case translate “if only because.”</note>




<note n="8.280.1">Cohn regards this sentence as corrupt and inserts ἐξαρκεῖν
after εὐμορφίας. He treats ἄργυρος . . . ὑπηρεσίαν as a parenthesis,
and marks a lacuna before αὐγοειδέστατον . . . ἰδόντες.
He translates “Silver and gold, etc. seem to rulers appointed to
the service of queenly virtue to be sufficient . . . they do not see
the radiant light.” In the text the parenthetical arrangement
suggests that he takes ἰδόντες as agreeing with τινες, but there
is no sign of this in the translation. In a note to his version
he justly remarks that it makes no sense, and the interpolation
of ἐξαρκεῖν, or, as suggested in the translation, ζηλωτὰ
(? ζηλωτὰ εἶναι), seems pointless. See note <hi rend="italic">a.</hi></note>



<note n="8.281.a">The first part of this sentence down to “virtue” as here
translated seems grammatically unimpeachable, and, I believe,
gives a perfectly Philonic thought. Though the actual figure
by which bodily and external goods are compared to officers serving practical needs as opposed to service in the court of virtue herself does not occur elsewhere, similar ideas are often to be found in Philo. Compare particularly the disquisition in <hi rend="italic">De Fuga</hi> 25–37, where the proper use of these things as a preliminary to the higher life of contemplation is enjoined. Remarks to the same effect appear in <hi rend="italic">De Sob.</hi> 61, <hi rend="italic">De Conf.</hi> 18, <hi rend="italic">Quis Rerum</hi> 285. There is more to be said for supposing a lacuna before αὐγοειδέστατον. The four words may be spurious, as they are omitted in S. Assuming that they are genuine, the abrupt change of metaphor and perhaps their application to the “goods” themselves, instead of their possessors, is strange. It would not be surprising if some words had fallen out explaining that while these were not “blind wealth,” they were not “seeing wealth” in the fullest sense. See further for Mangey’s version App. p. 449.</note>


<note n="8.281.b">For Stoic and other illustrations of this thought see App. p. 449.</note>


<note n="8.281.c">Or simply “place.” But the common sense of “estate” corresponds well to κλῆρος.</note>

De Mut.</hi> 71 “The student of the nature of heaven, whom some call the μαθηματικός,” a passage which also illustrates Philo’s regular assumption that Abraham before his call believed in Chaldaean astrology; <hi rend="italic">cf.

<note n="8.296.1">The genitive of quality is unusual, if not impossible, in
Greek. Mangey suggested μεστὸς or ὑπόπλεως ὢν. Perhaps
λαχὼν.</note>

<note n="8.299.a">Unless there is some independent tradition of Tamar’s
lineage, about which nothing is said in Gen. xxxviii. 6 ff.,
we must suppose that Philo assumes that, since she is not
said like Rebekah and Rachel and Leah to come of the line
of the patriarchs, she belonged to the idolatrous people
around. On Tamar see App. p. 450.</note>


<note n="8.299.b">i.e. the husband of her youth, him to whom her virginity
was given. κουρίδιος, which in § 114 was used in the ordinary
sense of a wedded or lawful mate, cannot mean this here, as the second marriage was as lawful as the first. The meaning which it appears to have here is also found in <hi rend="italic">Odyssey</hi> xv. 22, and is noted in Stephanus, though not in L. &amp; S.</note>


<note n="8.299.c">Gen. xxxviii. 7 f. “At Athens when a woman was left an heiress (ἐπίκληρος), without having a male (κύριος), or guardian, the next of kin might claim her in marriage. This claim was called ἐπιδικασία” (<hi rend="italic">Diet, of Ant.</hi>). Though this law is very different from the Hebrew law that the deceased husband’s brother should marry the childless widow, they have this in common, that they deal with the right possessed by the next of kin to the woman’s hand.</note>

<note n="8.302.1">At this point the important MS. F is mutilated; its reading
for the remaining sections are supplied by Cohn from the
MS. which he believes to be a copy of it, and indeed its twin
(<hi rend="italic">gemellus</hi>), known as Vaticanus 379.</note>


<note n="8.302.2">So or μεταδοτέον αὐτοῖς τοῖς in all MS. except the twin of
F just mentioned, which has τί τοίνυν μεταδοτέον τοῖς, and this
Cohn adopts and translates “what have we to do (or share
“teilen”) with those who,” etc. But apart from the question
whether the MS. evidence is weighty, this implies a use of
μεταδίδωμι which I have never noted in Philo, who regularly
follows it with the genitive. Cohn and others seem to have
found a difficulty in αὐτοῦ, for which λόγου has been proposed. If the sentence had been written as a statement in the reverse form τοῖς . . . τὸ ἀλλότριον, εὐγένειαν, ὑποδυομένοις οὐ μεταδοτέον αὐτοῦ, it would be perfectly natural, and the form here by which αὐτοῦ anticipates instead of follows the noun to which it refers does not create a serious difficulty, ἔτι τοίνυν as in § 85 and § 141 = “can we after this?”</note>



<note n="8.303.a">Mangey gives for δίχα “his exceptis,” and so Cohn. But “Those who claim to be εὐγενεῖς because of their descent, when their conduct was not εὐγενής <hi rend="italic">except</hi> those whose conduct was εὐγενής, though their descent was not, are enemies,” etc., is not sense. I have not found examples in prose for the sense required here, but Aesch. <hi rend="italic">Prom.</hi> 927 ὅσον τό τ᾿ ἄρχειν καὶ τὸ δουλεύειν δίχα is much the same.</note>
