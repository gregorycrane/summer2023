<head>On Rewards and Punishments</head>
<head>(And Curses)</head>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="1"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="1"/> The oracles delivered through the prophet Moses

are of three kinds.<ref target="8-313-a"/>  The first deals with the creation of the world, the second with history and the third with legislation. The story of the creation is told throughout with an excellence worthy of the divine subject, beginning with the genesis of Heaven and ending with the framing of man. For Heaven is the most perfect of things indestructible as man of things mortal, immortal and mortal being the original components out of which the Creator wrought the world, the one created then and there to take command, the other subject, as it were, to be also created in the future.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="2"><p>  The historical part is a record of



<pb n="315"/>
good and bad lives and of the sentences passed in each generation on both, rewards in one case, punishments in the other.  The legislative part has two divisions, one in which the subject matter is more general, the other consisting of the ordinances of specific laws. On the one hand there are the ten heads or summaries which we are told were not delivered through a spokesman but were shaped high above in the air into the form of articulate speech: on the other the specific ordinances of the oracles given through the lips of a prophet.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="3"><p> All these and

further the virtues which he assigned to peace and war<ref target="8-315-a"/>  have been discussed as fully as was needful in the preceding treatises, and I now proceed in due course to the rewards and punishments which the good and the bad have respectively to expect.
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="4"><p><milestone unit="para"/>After having schooled the citizens of his polity with

gentle instructions and exhortations and more sternly with threats and warnings he called on them to make a practical exhibition of what they had learned. They advanced as it were into the sacred arena and showed the spirit in which they would act bared ready for the contest, to the end that its sincerity might be tested beyond doubt.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="5"><p><ref target="8-315-b"/>  Then it was found

that the true athletes of virtue did not disappoint the high hopes of the laws which had trained them, but the unmanly whose souls were degenerate through inbred weakness, without waiting for any stronger counter-force to overpower them, dropped down, a source of shame to themselves and derision to the

<pb n="317"/>
spectators.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="6"><p> And therefore, while the former enjoyed

the prizes and laudatory announcements and all the other tributes which are paid to the victors, the latter departed not only without a crown but with the stigma of a defeat more grievous than those sustained in the gymnastic contests. For there the athletes’ bodies are brought low but can easily stand once more erect. Here it is whole lives that fall, which once overthrown can hardly be raised up again.
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="7"><p><milestone unit="para"/>The lessons which he gives on privilege, and

honour, and on the other hand on punishments fall under heads arranged in an orderly series, individual men, families, cities, countries and nations, vast regions of the earth.<ref target="8-317-a"/> 

<milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="2"/> We must first examine what is said of honours, as both more profitable and more pleasant to listen to, and we will begin with the honour paid to each single and particular individual.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="8"><p><ref target="8-317-b"/>  The Greeks say that the primeval hero

Triptolemus<ref target="8-317-c"/>  borne aloft on winged dragons sowed the corn-seed over the whole earth, in order that in place of the acorns which had been their food the human race might have a kindly,<ref target="8-317-d"/>  wholesome and exceedingly palatable means of nourishment. Now this story like many others is a mythical fable and may be left to those whose way is to deal in marvels and cultivate sophistry rather than wisdom, and imposture rather than truth.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="9"><p> For from the



<pb n="319"/>
beginning at the first creation of all things God provided beforehand, raised from the earth, what was necessary for all living animals and particularly for the human race to which he granted sovereignty over all earthborn creatures. For none of the works of God is of later birth, but all that seems to be accomplished by human skill and industry in later time was there by the foresight of nature lying ready half made, thus justifying the saying that learning is recollection.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="10"><p>  But this is not

a point for our present discussion. What we have to consider is that most vital form of seed which the Creator sowed in the rich soil of the rational soul.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="11"><p> And the first thing thus sown is hope, the fountain

head of the lives which we lead. In hope of gain the tradesman arms himself for the manifold forms of money getting. In hope of a successful voyage the skipper crosses the wide open seas. In hope of glory the ambitious man chooses political life and the charge of public affairs. The hope of prizes and crowns moves the training athlete to endure the contests of the arena. The hope of happiness incites also the devotees of virtue to study wisdom, believing that thus they will be able to discern the nature of all that exists and to act in accordance with nature<ref target="8-319-a"/>  and so bring to their fullness the best types of life, the contemplative and the practical, which necessarily make their possessor a happy man.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="12"><p> Now some have acted

like enemies in war to the germs of hope, and consumed them in the fire of the vices which they have kindled in the soul or like careless husbandmen have through their laziness allowed them to perish. There

<pb n="321"/>
are others who seem to have guarded them well but have clung to self-assertion rather than piety and regarded themselves as the source of their achievements. All these are to be condemned.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="13"><p><ref target="8-321-a"/> He alone

is worthy of approval who sets his hope on God both as the source to which his coming into existence itself is due and as the sole power which can keep him free from harm and destruction. What reward then is offered to the winner of the Crown in this contest? It is that living being whose nature is a mixture of the mortal and immortal, even man, not the same man nor yet another than the winner.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="14"><p><ref target="8-321-b"/>  The Hebrew

name for him is Enos, and Enos translated into Greek is ἄνθρωπος or man. He takes the name which is common to the whole race as his personal name, a reward of special distinction implying that no one should be thought a man at all who does not set his hope on God.

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="15"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="3"/> After the victory of hope comes the second

contest, in which repentance is the champion.<ref target="8-321-c"/>  Repentance has nothing of that nature which remains ever in the same stay without movement or change. It has been suddenly possessed with an ardent yearning for betterment, eager to leave its inbred covetousness and injustice and come over to soberness

<pb n="323"/>
and justice and the other virtues.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="16"><p> Repentance

also has two rewards assigned to its double achievement in abandoning the base and choosing the excellent. These rewards are a new home and a life of solitude; for he says of him who fled from the insurgency of the body to join the forces of the soul “he was not found because God transferred him.”</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="17"><p> By “transference” he clearly signifies the new home

and by “not found” the life of solitude. Very pertinently too. For if a man has really come to despise pleasures and desires and resolved in all sincerity to take his stand above the passions, he must prepare for a change of abode and flee from home and country and kinsfolk and friends without a backward glance. For great is the attraction of familiarity.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="18"><p>

We may fear that if he stays he may be cut off and captured by all the love charms which surround him and will call up visions to stir again the base practices which had lain dormant and create vivid memories of what it were well to have forgotten.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="19"><p> Many persons

in fact have come to a wiser mind by leaving their country and have been cured of their wild and frenzied cravings when sight can no longer minister to passion the images of pleasure. For when thus dissociated it must needs be treading on empty space since the stimulus of pleasure is no longer present.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="20"><p> And further if he changes his abode he

must shun great gatherings and welcome solitude. It cannot but be that even in the foreign soil there are many snares like those at home on which the shortsighted who delight in large assemblies are sure to be pinned. For a crowd is another name for everything

<pb n="325"/>
that is disorderly, indecorous, discordant, culpable, and to be carried along with the crowd is very detrimental to the virtue<ref target="8-325-a"/>  of the settler on his first arrival.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="21"><p> For just as when men are beginning to

recover from a long illness their bodies easily give way because their increase of strength is not yet firmly established, so in those whose soul is now for the first time becoming healthy the sinews of the mind are flabby and rickety, so that there is a danger that passion, which is naturally stimulated by association with the thoughtless, may break out afresh.

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="22"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="4"/> After the contest won by repentance come a

third set of rewards offered for justice.<ref target="8-325-b"/>  He who attains to justice receives two prizes, one his salvation amid the general destruction, the other his appointment to take into his charge and protection the specimens of each kind of living creatures, mated in couples to produce a second creation to make good the annihilation of the first.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="23"><p> For the

Creator judged it right that the same man should end the condemned and begin the innocent generation, thereby teaching by deeds and not by words those who deny that the world is governed by providence, that, under the law which He established in universal nature, all the myriads of the human race, if they have lived a life of injustice, are not worth a single man who has not departed from justice. This person, in whose day the great deluge took place, is called by the Greeks Deucalion and by the Hebrews Noah.<ref target="8-325-c"/> 

<pb n="327"/>
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="24"><p><milestone unit="para"/>After this Trinity comes another Trinity holier and

dearer to God, all belonging to one family. For it was a Father, a Son, a Grandson who pressed forward to the same goal of life, namely to be well pleasing to the Maker and Father of all. All that the multitudes admire, glory, wealth and pleasure, they despised, and laughed at vanity, that web woven of lies and cunningly devised to deceive the beholders.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="25"><p> Vanity

is the impostor who deifies lifeless objects, the great and formidable engine of aggression who with its scheming and trickery beguiles every city and loses no time in capturing the souls of the young. For it sets up its abode in them and remains there from earliest infancy to old age, save in the cases where God illumines them with a ray of truth—truth the antagonist of vanity who retreats before it though slowly and reluctantly vanquished by its superior power.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="26"><p> This<ref target="8-327-a"/>  kind is few in number but in power so

manifold and mighty that it cannot be contained by the whole compass of the earth but reaches to Heaven, possessed with an intense longing to contemplate and for ever be in the company of things divine. After investigating the whole realm of the visible to its very end, it straightway proceeds to the immaterial and conceptual, not availing itself of any of the senses but casting aside all the irrational part of the soul and employing only the part which is called mind and reasoning.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="27"><p> The leader in adopting

the godly creed, who first passed over from vanity to truth, came to his consummation by virtue gained through instruction, and he received for his reward

<pb n="329"/>
belief in God.<ref target="8-329-a"/>  To him who happily gifted by nature has acquired the virtue which listens to no other than itself, learns from no other, is taught by no other, the prize awarded is joy. The man of practice who by unwearied and unswerving labour has made the excellent his own has for his crown the vision of God. Belief in God, life-long joy, the perpetual vision of the Existent—what can anyone conceive more profitable or more august than these?

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="28"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="5"/> But let us look into each of them more carefully

and not be led away by mere names but with a peering eye explore the inwardness of their full meaning. Now he who has sincerely believed in God has learned to disbelieve in all else, all that is created only to perish, beginning with the forces which so loudly assert themselves in him, reasoning and sense-perception. Each of these has assigned to it a council chamber and tribunal, where they conduct their inspections, one into the conceptual, the other into the visible, one with truth, the other with opinion for its goal.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="29"><p> The instability and waywardness of opinion

is obvious in that it is based on likelihoods<ref target="8-329-b"/>  and plausibilities, and every likeness by its deceptive resemblance falsifies the original. Reason, sense-perception’s master, who thinks itself appointed to judge things conceptual, which ever continue in the same stay, is found to be in sore trouble on many points. For when it comes to grapple with the vast

<pb n="331"/>
number of particular subjects it becomes incapable, grows exhausted and collapses like an athlete flung prostrate by superior power.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="30"><p> But he to whom it is

given to gaze and soar beyond not only material but all immaterial things, and to take God for his sole stay and support with a reasonableness whose resolution falters not, and a faith unswerving and securely founded, will be a truly happy and thrice blessed man.
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="31"><p><milestone unit="para"/>After faith comes the reward set aside for the

victorious champion who gained his virtue through nature and without a struggle. That reward is joy. For his name was in our speech “laughter” but as the Hebrews call it Isaac. Laughter is the outward and bodily sign of the unseen joy in the mind, and joy is in fact the best and noblest of the higher emotions.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="32"><p> By it the soul is filled through and through

with cheerfulness, rejoicing in the Father and Maker of all, rejoicing too in all His doings in which evil has no place, even though they do not conduce to its own pleasure, rejoicing because they are done for good and serve to preserve all that exists.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="33"><p> A physician

treating serious and dangerous diseases sometimes amputates parts of the body, hoping to secure the health of the rest, and the pilot in stormy weather casts cargo overboard to provide for the safety of the passengers. No blame attaches either to the physician for the mutilation or to the pilot for sacrifice of property, but on the contrary both are praised for looking to what is profitable rather than what is pleasant, and for having done the right thing.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="34"><p> In the

same way we must always reverence all-embracing nature and acquiesce cheerfully in its actions in the universe, free as they are from all intention of evil.

<pb n="333"/>
For the question before us is not whether the events are pleasant to us personally but whether the chariot and ship of the universe is guided in safety like a well-ordered state.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="35"><p> So he too is blessed no less than

the first named. He never knows gloom and depression; his days are passed in happy freedom from fears and grief; the hardships and squalor of life never touch him even in his dreams, because every spot in his soul is already tenanted by joy.

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="36"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="6"/> After the self-taught, the man enriched by his

natural gifts, the third to reach perfection is the Man of Practice who receives for his special reward the vision of God. For having been in touch with every side of human life and in no half-hearted familiarity with them all, and having shirked no toil or danger if thereby he might descry the truth, a quest well worthy of such love, he found mortal kind set in deep darkness spread over earth and water and the lower air and ether too. For ether and the whole Heaven wore to his eyes the semblance of night, since the whole realm of sense is without defining bounds, and the indefinite is close akin, even brother, to darkness.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="37"><p><ref target="8-333-a"/>  In his former years the eyes of his soul had been

closed, but by means of continuous striving he began though slowly to open them and to break up and throw off the mist which overshadowed him. For a beam purer than ether<ref target="8-333-b"/>  and incorporeal suddenly shone upon him and revealed the conceptual world

<pb n="335"/>
ruled by its charioteer.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="38"><p> That charioteer, ringed as he

was with beams of undiluted light, was beyond his sight or conjecture, for the eye was darkened by the dazzling beams. Yet in spite of the fiery stream which flooded it, his sight held its own in its unutterable longing to behold the vision.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="39"><p><ref target="8-335-a"/>  The Father and

Saviour perceiving the sincerity of his yearning in pity gave power to the penetration of his eyesight and did not grudge to grant him the vision of Himself in so far as it was possible for mortal and created nature to contain it. Yet the vision only showed that He is, not what He is.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="40"><p> For this which is better

than the good, more venerable than the monad, purer than the unit, cannot be discerned by anyone else; to God alone is it permitted to apprehend God.

<milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="7"/> Now the fact that He is which can be apprehended under the name of His subsistence, is not apprehended by all or at any rate not in the best way. Some distinctly deny that there is such a thing as the Godhead. Others hesitate and fluctuate as though unable to state whether there is or not. Others whose notions about the subsistence of God are derived through habit rather than thinking from those who brought them up, believe themselves to have successfully attained to religion yet have left on it the imprint of superstition.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="41"><p><ref target="8-335-b"/>  Others again who

have had the strength through knowledge to envisage

<pb n="337"/>
the Maker and Ruler of all have in the common phrase advanced from down to up. Entering the world as into a well-ordered city they have beheld the earth standing fast, highland and lowland full of sown crops and trees and fruits and all kinds of living creatures to boot; also spread over its surface, seas and lakes and rivers both spring fed and winter torrents. They have seen too the air and breezes so happily tempered, the yearly seasons changing in harmonious order, and over all the sun and moon, planets and fixed stars, the whole heaven and heaven’s host, line upon line, a true universe in itself revolving within the universe.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="42"><p> Struck with admiration and

astonishment they arrived at a conception according with what they beheld, that surely all these beauties and this transcendent order has not come into being automatically but by the handiwork of an architect and world maker; also that there must be a providence, for it is a law of nature that a maker should take care of what has been made.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="43"><p>  These

no doubt are truly admirable persons and superior to the other classes. They have as I said advanced from down to up by a sort of heavenly ladder and by reason and reflection<ref target="8-337-a"/>  happily inferred the Creator from His works. But those, if such there be, who have had the power to apprehend Him through Himself without the co-operation of any reasoning process to lead them to the sight, must be recorded as holy and genuine worshippers and friends of God in very truth.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="44"><p> In their company is he who in the Hebrew is



<pb n="339"/>
called Israel but in our tongue the God-seer who sees not His real nature, for that, as I said, is impossible—but that He is. And this knowledge he has gained not from any other source, not from things on earth or things in Heaven, not from the elements or combinations of elements mortal or immortal, but at the summons<ref target="8-339-a"/>  of Him alone who has willed to reveal His existence as a person<ref target="8-339-b"/>  to the suppliant.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="45"><p> How this

access has been obtained may be well seen through an illustration. Do we behold the sun which sense perceives by any other thing than the sun, or the stars by any others than the stars, and in general is not light seen by light? In the same way God too is His own brightness and is discerned through Himself alone, without anything co-operating or being able to co-operate in giving a perfect apprehension of His existence.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="46"><p> They then do but make a happy

guess, who are at pains to discern the Uncreated, and Creator of all from His creation, and are on the same footing as those who try to trace the nature of the monad from the dyad, whereas observation of the dyad should begin with the monad which is the starting-point.<ref target="8-339-c"/>  The seekers for truth are those who envisage God through God, light through light.

<milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="8"/> So much for his chief reward.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="47"><p>

But besides all this the Practiser receives a prize with an ill-sounding name but excellent when we consider its meaning.<ref target="8-339-d"/>  This prize is symbolically

<pb n="341"/>
called the “numbing of the broad part.” By the “broad part” arrogance and pride are suggested, since the soul spreads itself inordinately in the wrong direction; by “numbing,” the contraction of the conceit which lifts itself on high and puffs itself out.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="48"><p> And nothing is so profitable as that the laxity

and free play of the appetites should be hampered and numbed with their vitalizing forces<ref target="8-341-a"/>  paralysed so that the inordinate strength of the passions may be exhausted and thus provide a breadth in which the better part of the soul may expand.
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="49"><p><milestone unit="para"/>A further question for consideration is the special

suitability of the reward assigned to each of the three. Faith for him who was perfected through teaching, since the learner must believe the instructions of his teacher: to educate a disbeliever is difficult or rather impossible.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="50"><p> Joy for him who through the happiness

of his natural endowments arrives at virtue. For good abilities and natural gifts are a matter for rejoicing. The mind exults in the facility of its apprehension and the felicity of the processes<ref target="8-341-b"/>  by which it discovers what it seeks without labour, as though dictated by an inward prompter. For to find the solution of difficulties quickly must bring joy. Vision for him who attains wisdom through practice.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="51"><p>

For after the active life of youth the contemplative life of old age is the best and most sacred—, that life which God sends to the stern like a helmsman and entrusts the rudder into its hands as well fitted to steer the course of earthly things. For without con-temptation

<pb n="343"/>
and the knowledge which it gives no activity attains excellence.<ref target="8-343-a"/> 

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="52"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="9"/> One other man I will mention and then, as I

wish to avoid prolixity, proceed to the next part of the subject. This man is he who in the sacred contests one after the other was proclaimed the winner of the crown. By sacred contests I do not mean those which men regard as such<ref target="8-343-b"/> ; they are unholy since they offer instead of the utmost penalties honours and crowns to violence, outrage and injustice. I mean those which the soul has to fight out, wielding successfully wisdom against folly and knavery, moderation against profligacy and miserliness, courage against rashness and cowardice, and the other virtues against the opposite<ref target="8-343-c"/>  vices which are at variance with one another<ref target="8-343-d"/>  and with other vices too.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="53"><p> Now all

the virtues are virgins, but the fairest among them all, the acknowledged queen of the dance, is piety, which Moses, the teacher of divine lore, in a special degree had for his own, and through it gained among a multitude of other gifts, which have been described in the treatises dealing with his life, four special rewards, the offices of king, legislator, prophet and high priest.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="54"><p><ref target="8-343-e"/>  For he did not become king in the ordinary

way by the aid of troops and weapons or of the might of ships and infantry and cavalry. It was God who

<pb n="345"/>
appointed him by the free judgement of his subjects, God who created in them the willingness to choose him as their sovereign.<ref target="8-345-a"/>  Of him alone we read that without the gifts of speech<ref target="8-345-b"/>  or possessions or money he was made a king, he who eschewed the blind wealth and embraced that which has eyes to see, and, as we may say without reserve, held that all he owned was to have God for his heritage.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="55"><p><ref target="8-345-c"/>  This same person was

also a lawgiver. For a king must enjoin and forbid and a law is nothing else but a pronouncement enjoining what ought to be done and forbidding what ought not.<ref target="8-345-d"/>  But in both cases there is uncertainty as to what is profitable, since through ignorance we often enjoin what should not be done and forbid what should be done, and therefore it was meet that he should receive a third gift of prophecy to keep his feet from stumbling. For the prophet is the interpreter of God who prompts from within what he should say, and with God nothing is in fault.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="56"><p> Meet

also<ref target="8-345-e"/>  that he should have the fourth office of chief priesthood to enable him armed with prophetic knowledge to worship the Self-existent, and offer up thanksgivings for his subjects when they do well and prayers and supplications for propitiation when they do amiss. All these are one in kind; they should co-exist united with bonds of harmony and be found

<pb n="347"/>
embodied in the same person, since he who falls short in any of the four is imperfectly equipped for government and the administration of public affairs which he has undertaken will limp and halt.

individual men, but houses and families of many members have theirs also. For instance the twelve tribes into which the nation was divided had the same number of chieftains connected not only by membership of the same house and family but by a still more real affinity, for they were brothers with the same father, and their grandfather and great-grandfather as well as their father were the founders of the nation.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="58"><p> The first of these who passed from vanity to truth,

who spurned the impostures of Chaldean astrology<ref target="8-347-b"/>  for the sake of the fuller spectacle which he beheld and followed the vision, drawn to it as iron is said to be drawn by the magnet, thus changed by instruction from sophist to sage, had many children, but all faulty<ref target="8-347-c"/>  save one to whom he bound fast the cables of the race and there found a safe haven.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="59"><p> That son

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="60"><p> This is the third

of the founders, father of many children and alone among the three blessed in them all, who met with no mishap in any part of his household, like a happy husbandman who sees his whole crop safe and sound, thriving under his hand<ref target="8-349-b"/>  and bearing fruit.

of a hidden meaning which demands examination.<ref target="8-349-c"/>  Thus everyone who is taught, when he passes over to knowledge, must abandon ignorance. Ignorance is multiform and therefore it is said of the first of the three that he was the father of many children but did not deem any of them worthy to be called his sons save one. For the learner may also be said to disown the offspring of ignorance and discard them, seeing their hostility and ill will.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="62"><p> Again naturally all

we men, before the reason in us is fully grown, lie in the borderline between vice and virtue with no bias to either side. But when the mind is fully fledged

<pb n="351"/>
when it has seen and absorbed into every part of its vitality the vision of the good, it ranges freely and wings its way to reach that vision and leaves behind good’s brother and birth-fellow evil, which also flies away straight on in the opposite direction.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="63"><p><ref target="8-351-a"/>  This is

what underlies his saying that the possessor of a highly gifted nature was the father of twins. For the soul of every man from the first as soon as he is born bears in its womb the twins good and evil as I have said and has the vision of both before him, but, when it comes to have happiness and bliss for its lot, it inclines uniformly to the god, never swaying in the other direction nor oscillating into equilibrium between the two.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="64"><p> Once more if the soul has received a

good nature, good instruction and thirdly therewith exercise in the principles of virtue, none of them fluid and superficial, but all cemented within it, firmly impressed and strung as it were into a unity, it wins health, wins power, and to these are added the fine hue of modesty and a robust and comely form.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="65"><p><ref target="8-351-b"/>  This soul through the triple excellence of

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="66"><p> From

this household, increased in the course of time to a great multitude, were founded flourishing and orderly cities, schools of wisdom, justice and religion, where also the rest of virtue and how to acquire it is the sublime subject of their research.

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="67"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="12"/> We have discussed typical<ref target="8-353-b"/>  examples of the

rewards assigned in the past to the good both individually and in common with others, from which anyone can easily discern those which have been left unnoticed. We have next to consider in their turn the punishments appointed for the wicked, but in a general way since this is not the time to describe particular cases.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="68"><p> At the very beginning when the

human race had not yet multiplied arose a fratricide.<ref target="8-353-c"/>  He it was who first fell under a curse, who first brought

<pb n="355"/>
the monstrous pollution of human blood upon the still pure earth, who first, when it was giving birth and growth to every kind of animals and plants and was bright with all the products of its fruitfulness, set a bar to that fruitfulness, who first armed dissolution against generation, death against life, sorrow against joy and evil against good.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="69"><p> What then could

be done to him by which he would pay the penalty he deserved, he who in a single action included everything that is violent and impious? Slay him, perhaps you will say. That is a man’s idea—man who has no eyes for the great court of justice,—for men think that death is the termination of punishment but in the divine court it is hardly the beginning.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="70"><p> Since

then the deed was without precedent, the punishment devised had to be also without precedent. What is this punishment? That he should live for ever in a state of dying and so to speak suffer a death which is deathless and unending. For there are two kinds of death, one consists in being dead, which is something either good or indifferent, the other consists in dying and that is entirely bad, more painful because more durable.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="71"><p> Death thus remains with him

perpetually; observe how that is effected. There are four passions in the soul, two concerned with the good, either at the time or in the future, that is pleasure and desire, and two concerned with evil present or expected, that is grief and fear. The pair on the good side God tore out of him by the roots so that never by any chance he should have any pleasant sensations or desire anything pleasant, and engrafted in him only the pair on the bad side, producing grief unmixed with cheerfulness and fear unrelieved.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="72"><p> For he says that he laid a curse upon the



<pb n="357"/>
fratricide that he should ever“ groan and tremble.”<ref target="8-357-a"/>  And he set a sign upon him that no man should slay him so that he should not die once but continue perpetually dying, as I have said, dying with anguish and distress and sufferings unceasing, and most grievous of all should be sensible of his own evil plight, feeling the weight of the present ills and foreseeing the onrush of those yet to come against which he could not guard. For hope had been torn from him, hope which God has sown in mankind that they should have a comforter to be part of their nature and give relief to the distress of all whose deeds are not beyond atonement.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="73"><p> So as a man

carried away by a torrent dreads the stream around him in which he is swept along but dreads still more the onrush of the flood from above propelling him violently and ceaselessly, but also towering high over him and threatening to engulf him, so too the ills close at hand are painful but more grievous are those which flow from fear, fear which supplies abundance of sorrows as from a fountain.

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="74"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="13"/> Such are the penalties decreed against the

man who first committed fratricide, but there are others decreed against groups<ref target="8-357-b"/>  who conspire to sin in common.<ref target="8-357-c"/>  There were certain temple attendants, servitors of the sanctuary, appointed to the office of gate-keepers. These persons filled with insensate ambition rose against the priests whose privileges they claimed should belong to themselves.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="75"><p> They



<pb n="359"/>
adopted as leader of the sedition the senior<ref target="8-359-a"/>  from among them, who also with a few<ref target="8-359-b"/>  fellow madmen had been the instigator of the presumptuous enterprise, and leaving the frontage and the outermost parts of the building proceeded towards the inmost sanctuary<ref target="8-359-c"/>  intending to displace those to whom divine utterances had adjudged the priesthood.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="76"><p> Naturally enough the whole multitude was greatly

disturbed. They felt that their fundamental institutions were being shaken, their laws violated, and the decent order of the holy place reduced to chaos by such alarming anarchy.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="77"><p> All this roused the indignation

of the guardian and ruler of the nation. At first very seriously, but without loss of temper, which indeed was alien to his nature, he endeavoured with words of admonition to bring them to a better mind and to refrain from transgressing the appointed limits or revolting against the sacred and hallowed institutions on which the hopes of the nation depended. But this he found was of no avail.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="78"><p> They

were deaf to all his words, believing that in appointing his brother high priest and committing the priesthood to his nephews he had given way to family affection. He was not however greatly aggrieved at this, great grievance though it was. What he felt to be intolerable was that they should purpose<ref target="8-359-d"/>  to set at nought the divine instructions under which the choice of the priests had been made. . . .<ref target="8-359-e"/> 

<pb n="361"/>

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="79"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="14"/> . . . A clear testimony is recorded in the

Holy Scriptures. We will cite first<ref target="8-361-a"/>  the invocations<ref target="8-361-b"/>  which he is accustomed to call benedictions.<ref target="8-361-c"/>  If, he says, you keep the divine commandment in obedience to his ordinances and accept his precepts, not merely to hear them but to carry them out by your life and conduct, the first boon<ref target="8-361-d"/>  you will have is victory over your enemies.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="80"><p><ref target="8-361-e"/>  For the commandments are not too

huge and heavy for the strength of those to whom they will apply, nor is the good far away either beyond the sea or at the end of the earth, so that it requires of you a lingering and wearisome exile, nor has it suddenly left this earth to settle in Heaven, so that one can scarce reach them though he soar on high and wing his way thither. No, it is close by, very near, firmly set in three of the parts of which each of us is constituted, mouth and heart and hand, representing in a figure respectively speech and thought and action.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="81"><p> For if our words correspond

with our thoughts and intentions and our actions with our words and the three mutually follow each other, bound together with indissoluble bonds of harmony, happiness prevails and happiness is wisdom pure of all falsehood, the higher and the lower

<pb n="363"/>
wisdom,<ref target="8-363-a"/>  the higher for the worship of God, the lower for the regulation of human life.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="82"><p> Now while

the commandments of the laws are only on our lips our acceptance of them is little or none, but when we add thereto deeds which follow in their company, deeds shown in the whole conduct of our lives, the commandments will be as it were brought up out of the deep darkness into the light and surrounded with the brightness of good fame and good report.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="83"><p> For

who, however spiteful his nature, would not admit that surely that nation alone is wise and full of knowledge<ref target="8-363-b"/>  whose history has been such that it has not left the divine exhortations voided and forsaken by the actions which are akin to them, but has fulfilled the words with laudable deeds?</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="84"><p> Such a race

has its dwelling not far from God; it has the vision of etherial loveliness always before its eyes, and its steps are guided by a heavenward yearning. So that if one should ask “what manner of nation is great? others might aptly answer “a nation which has God to listen to its prayers inspired by true religion and to draw nigh when they call upon him with a clean conscience.”<ref target="8-363-c"/> 

<milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="15"/> Enmity is of two kinds.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="85"><p> There is the enmity

of men which has selfishness for its motive and is deliberately practised, and there is the enmity of wild beasts which is actuated by natural antipathy without such deliberation. Consequently each must be treated separately, taking first that of our natural

<pb n="365"/>
foes, the beasts, whose hatred is directed not towards a single city or nation but to mankind as a whole and endures not for a limited period but is age-long, without bound or limit of time.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="86"><p> Some of these fear

man as their master and cringe before him yet retain a rancorous hatred, others are audacious and more venturesome and are the first to attack, lying in wait to seize their opportunity if they are weaker, openly if they are stronger.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="87"><p> For this is the one

war where no quarter or truce is possible; as wolves with lambs, so all wild beasts both on land and water are at war with all men. This war no mortal can quell; that is done only by the Uncreated, when He judges that there are some<ref target="8-365-a"/>  worthy of salvation, men of peaceful disposition who cherish brotherly affection and good fellowship, in whom envy has either found no room at all or has entered only to take its departure with all speed, because their will is to bring their private blessings into the common stock to be shared and enjoyed by all alike.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="88"><p> Would that this good gift might shine upon

our life and that we might be able to see that day when savage creatures become tame and gentle. But a very necessary preliminary to this is that the wild beasts within the soul shall be tamed, and no greater boon than this can be found. For is it not foolish to suppose that we shall escape the mischief which the brutes outside us can do if we are always working up those within us to dire savagery? Therefore we need not give up hope that when the wild

<pb n="367"/>
beasts within us are fully tamed the animals too will become tame and gentle.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="89"><p> When that time comes I

believe that bears and lions and panthers and the Indian animals, elephants and tigers, and all others whose vigour and power are invincible, will change their life of solitariness and isolation for one of companionship, and gradually in imitation of the gregarious creatures show themselves tame when brought face to face with mankind. They will no longer as heretofore be roused to ferocity by the sight, but will be awe-struck into respectful fear of him as their natural lord and master, while others will grow gentle in emulation of the docility and affection for the master<ref target="8-367-a"/>  shown for instance by the little Maltese dogs,<ref target="8-367-b"/>  who express their fondness with the tails which they so cheerily wag.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="90"><p> Then too the

tribes of scorpions and serpents and the other reptiles will have no use for their venom. The Egyptian river too carries man-eating creatures called crocodiles and hippopotamuses in close proximity to the inhabitants of the country, so too the seas have their multitudinous species of very formidable animals. Among all these the man of worth will move sacrosanct and inviolate because God has respected virtue and given it the privilege that none should imagine mischief against it.

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="91"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="16"/> Thus the age-long and natural and therefore



<pb n="369"/>
primary war`<ref target="8-369-a"/>  will be brought to an end through the change which makes the wild beasts tame and amenable. And then its later successor whose source is selfishness and its method deliberate will be easily settled, because men, I believe, will take shame to think that they should prove to be more savage than the irrational animals, when they have escaped all danger of injury or mischief from them.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="92"><p> For surely it will seem a deep disgrace that while

venomous and man-eating brutes and creatures without a sense of fellowship or companionship have become placable and have been won over to a peaceful disposition, man, a creature naturally gentle and kindly, in whom the sense of fellowship and amity is ingrained, should implacably seek the life of his own kind.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="93"><p> Either, then, as he says, the war

will not pass through the land of the godly at all,<ref target="8-369-b"/>  but will dissolve and fall to pieces of itself when the enemy perceives the nature of their opponents, that they have in justice an irresistible ally. For virtue is majestic and august and can unaided and silently allay the onsets of evils however great.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="94"><p>  Or

if some fanatics whose lust for war defies restraint or remonstrance come careering to attack, till they are actually engaged,<ref target="8-369-c"/>  they will be full of arrogance and bluster, but when they have come to a trial of blows they will find that their talk has been an idle boast. Win they cannot. Forced back by your

<pb n="371"/>
superior strength, they will fly headlong,<ref target="8-371-a"/>  companies of hundreds before handfuls of five, ten thousands before hundreds by many ways for the one by which they came.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="95"><p><ref target="8-371-b"/>  Some, without even any

pursuer save fear, will turn their backs and present admirable targets to their enemies so that it would be an easy matter for all to fall slaughtered to a man.<ref target="8-371-c"/>  For “there shall come forth a man,”<ref target="8-371-d"/>  says the oracle, and leading his host to war he will subdue great and populous nations, because God has sent to his aid the reinforcement which befits the godly, and that is dauntless courage of soul and all-powerful strength of body, either of which strikes fear into the enemy and the two if united are quite irresistible.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="96"><p> Some of the enemy, he says, will be unworthy

to be defeated by men.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="97"><p> He promises to marshal against them to their shame and perdition, swarms of wasps<ref target="8-371-e"/>  to fight in the van of the godly, who will

win not only a permanent and bloodless victory in the war but also a sovereignty which none can contest, bringing to its subjects the benefit which will accrue from the affection or fear or respect which they feel. For the conduct of their rulers shows three high qualities which contribute to make a government secure from subversion, namely dignity, strictness, benevolence, which produce the feelings mentioned above. For respect is created by dignity,

<pb n="373"/>
fear by strictness, affection by benevolence, and these when blended harmoniously in the soul render subjects obedient to their rulers.

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="98"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="17"/> These are the first blessings which he tells

us will fall to the lot of those who follow God and always and everywhere cleave to His commandments and so fasten them to every part of life that no part can go astray into new and unwholesome ways. The second blessing is wealth which necessarily follows peace and settled authority.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="99"><p> Now the simple wealth

of nature is food and shelter.<ref target="8-373-a"/>  Its food is bread and the spring water which gushes up in every part of the inhabited world.

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="100"><p> Yet those

who pursue the above-named wealth, who welcome the gifts of nature and not those of empty seeming, who practise frugality and self-restraint, will possess also abundance and more than abundance of another wealth in the shape of delectable food, and that without effort on their part. For it will spring to meet them as best fitted to receive it and as men of serious purpose who will know how to use it aright, and it will gladly flee from association with men of profligacy and violence, lest it should minister its boons to those who live to harm their neighbours and pass by those who serve the common weal.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="101"><p> For there is a

divine promise<ref target="8-373-b"/>  that on those who keep the sacred ordinances Heaven will shower timely rains, and the earth will bear abundance of every kind of food, the

lowlands of sown grain, the highlands of tree fruits, and no season will be left without some measure of beneficence, but so continuous will be the succession of the gifts of God “that the reaping will overtake the vintage and the vintage the seed time.”</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="102"><p><ref target="8-375-a"/>  Thus in

ceaseless and unbroken order they will gather in the former harvest and hope for the latter, one set waiting to follow another, so that the beginnings of the later may join on to the ends of the earlier and move round and round in a procession from which no good thing is withheld.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="103"><p> For the multitude of things

produced will suffice both for immediate use and enjoyment and to provide a generous surplus for the future, as the new crops ripen over the old and fill up what is lacking in them. Sometimes so vast will be the fertility that no one will take any thought for the harvest that is past but will leave it unhusbanded and unhoarded for all who wish to use it without fear or scruple.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="104"><p> For those who possess stored up in Heaven

the true wealth whose adornment is<ref target="8-375-b"/>  wisdom and godliness have also wealth of earthly riches in abundance.

those who through injustice and impiety have no heavenly portion cannot prosper in acquiring earthly goods either, and if any such acquisition comes their way it speedily springs away as if its coming at all were not to benefit its possessor but to make the distress which necessarily follows on lack of means<ref target="8-377-b"/>  weigh more heavily upon him.

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="114"><p> So then one such man 

in a city, if such be found, will be superior to the city, one such city to the country around, one such nation will stand above other nations, as the head above the body, to be conspicuous on every side, not for its own glory but rather for the benefit of the beholders.

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="115"><p> And therefore those who would imitate these 



<pb n="383"/>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="119"><p> He promises that those who take pains to cultivate

Health will be followed by efficiency of the senses and the perfection and completeness of every part, so that without impediment they may render each the services for which it was made.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="120"><p> For God thought it meet to 

grant as a privilege to the man of worth that his body, the congenital<ref target="8-385-c"/>  house of the soul, should be a house well built and well compacted from foundation to roof, to provide the many things which are necessary or useful for life and particularly for the sake of the mind of which we are speaking, a<ref target="8-385-d"/>  mind purged clean of every spot.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="121"><p> This mind, the initiate of the holy mysteries, the

But if it resides in a healthy body it will have full ease to live there devoting its leisure to the lore of wisdom, thus gaining a blessed and happy life. This mind it is that drinks deep of the strong wine of God’s beneficent power and feasts on holy thoughts and doctrines.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="123"><p> This it is in which God, so says the

<p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="21"/> The first curse which he describes as the 

lightest of their evils is poverty and dearth and lack of necessaries and conditions of absolute destitution.

<pb n="391"/>
The crops, he says, will be ravaged while unripe, or reaped when ripe by the sudden attacks of the hostile army, and thus will bring about a double misfortune, starvation for friends and abundance for enemies.<ref target="8-391-a"/>  For the good fortune of the foe is more or at any rate no less painful than our own suffering.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="128"><p> And even if the enemy take no action the more 

grievous injuries which nature inflicts will not be inactive. You put seed in the deep soil of the lowlands, and a cloud of locusts will suddenly fly down and reap the harvest, leaving only an insignificant fraction of what you sowed for you to gather.<ref target="8-391-b"/>  You plant a vineyard, spare no expense and endure the endless hardships which the husbandman has to expect, and, when it is come to its fullness and is flourishing, laden with a plentiful crop, worms will come and strip the grapes.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="129"><p><ref target="8-391-c"/>  When you see your 

olive yards thriving with an abundant wealth of fruit you will naturally be pleased at the prospect of a fortunate ingathering, but when you come to pick them you will be faced with misfortune, better called the punishment of impiety.<ref target="8-391-d"/>  For the oil and all the fatness will run out unnoticed,<ref target="8-391-e"/>  and the outer lump will be left by itself as empty of all goodness as the soul which it remains to disappoint. In fact all

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="130"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="22"/> But besides these there are other sufferings 

waiting their turn to create want and destitution. The sources which nature uses to bestow her boons on mankind, earth and heaven, will become barren. Earth will destroy her fruit in the germ and prove unable to bring them to their fullness. Heaven will be transformed into sterility, as none of the yearly seasons, neither winter nor summer, nor spring nor autumn arise to take their proper places but all are forcibly merged<ref target="8-393-b"/>  in formless turbid<ref target="8-393-c"/>  congeries by the dictation of an imperious power.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="131"><p> For no downpour, 

no shower, no slight drizzle nor tiny dropping, no dew nor anything else that can promote growth will come. But on the contrary all that makes havoc of growing plants or destroys the ripened fruit will be provided to hinder them from coming to their perfection. For He says “I will make the heaven brazen to you and the earth iron,”<ref target="8-393-d"/>  indicating that both of them will fail to perform their proper functions for which they were made.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="132"><p> For when did
