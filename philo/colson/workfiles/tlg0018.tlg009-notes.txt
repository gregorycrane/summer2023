<note n="3.116.2">MSS. μούσης.</note>




<note n="3.119.a">Or “earned from his working.” Philo plays with
ἐργάζομαι which can mean either “to work” (till) or “gain by
work.” So, too, ἄγος (pollution) carries with it the idea of a
curse and explains the ἐπικατάρατος of the text.</note>


<note n="3.119.b">Or “add.” <hi rend="italic">Cf. Quod Det.</hi> 112.</note>

<note n="3.125.a">Or “actively promoting the warfare of the stage,”i.e.
encouraging by their partisanship the rivalries and intrigues
of the actors. Mangey “factiones theatricas instaurant.” Philo frequently uses συγκροτέω with πόλεμον in the sense of
“organize” or “wage”; otherwise it might be taken as=“applaud.”</note>

<note n="3.155.a">Whether ἡδεῖς is taken as nom. or acc., it is doubtful Greek in this sense. Mangey’s ἡδέως is more natural.</note>

&lt;κακὸν&gt; σύμβουλον.</note>




<note n="3.160.1">The passage is evidently corrupt. Wendland’s conjecture
that there is a lacuna after ἀρετῆς which he supplies
with &lt;εὐοδίαν ψυχῇ παρ&gt;έχεται μόνα has been followed in the</note>



<note n="3.160.1">translation, but it is a mere guess; and the ἔχεσθαι τῆς ὁδοῦ in the next sentence rather suggests that ἐχύμενα should be kept.</note>




<note n="3.163.a">i.e. “and remains there.”</note>

<note n="3.173.b">The main links of the thought from here to § 168 may be
given as follows: Good ideas are often spoilt for want of
proper analysis or “distinguishing,” but (§ 134) distinguishing
by itself is useless, without remembering and meditating on
what has been learnt (<hi rend="italic">cf. De Sac.</hi> 82 ff.). In connexion with
this we have the tirade against futile and exaggerated distinguishing (cf. §§136–141). The two together will give perfection, but till this is gained the beginner must not attempt things beyond his capacity (§§ 146–165), or he will find himself supplanted by others (§§ 166–168).</note>

<note n="3.177.c">Or “such as they think well . . . and even more” (i.e. than they themselves think worth remembering).</note>

<note n="3.178.2">Perhaps (as in Diog. Laert. vii. 69) &lt;τὰ διασαφοῦντα&gt; (or some equivalent participle) τὸ μᾶλλον καὶ ἧττον.</note>



<note n="3.179.a">Or “from the primary (divisions) to the ultimate.”</note>


<note n="3.179.b">The Stoics admitted four kinds of “incorporeal” things,
viz. time, place, void, and λεκτόν or σημαινόμενον, i.e. the
<hi rend="italic">meaning</hi> conveyed by speech as opposed to the actual sound which was corporeal. See <hi rend="italic">S.V.F.</hi> ii. 331. Philo ignores the first three and deals with the subdivisions of λεκτόν.</note>

<note n="3.182.1">The translation follows Wend., who supplies after ἀρίστων
some such word as καὶ μνήμη χωρὶς διαιρέσεως τῶν ἀγαθῶν καὶ
τῶν ἐναντίων; but see App. 493.</note>



<note n="3.183.a">E.V. “officers.”</note>




<note n="3.184.1">Wend. prints a mark of interrogation here and in § 151
after ἀναδέξεται. The translators have substituted full stops,
regarding the sentences in both cases as objections raised by
the other side.</note>



<note n="3.185.a">The elaborate argument which follows to show that Moses must have intended an intellectual or spiritual warfare takes the form of a dialogue with the γραμματεῖς in which they raise objections in §§ 150, 151, and 155.</note>




<note n="3.186.1">Conj. Tr.: MSS. πάντα: Cohn suggested ταῦτα δρᾶν αἴσχιστον. Perhaps πολέμου &lt;πολέμου&gt; πάντα, i.e. in time of war it is well that all that is done should be things of war. Possibly πολέμου &lt;ὅσα πολέμου&gt;, cf. § 25 above.</note>

μέλλει γενέσθαι ἀνὴρ.</note>


<note n="3.190.2"><hi rend="italic">Sic</hi> MSS. Emendations proposed are οὔπω ἐντριβὴς or ἔτι
ἀτριβὴς (? πω ἀτριβὴς, the usage being perhaps defensible with
the implied negative in ἀτριβὴς).</note>



<note n="3.191.a">Or the passage may be taken as follows: “The lawgiver
is not speaking of house or vineyard. . . . He does not wish
that he should take to wife . . . But he is speaking of the faculties of a man’s soul;” cf. for this use of ὁ λόγος αὐτῷ, “he is not speaking about,” § 88 above.</note>

<note n="3.193.a">See App. p. 493.</note>




<note n="3.194.1">The translation follows Wend., who suggests οὐ τὰς
αὐτὰς &lt;ἀεὶ κατοικοῦσαι, ἀλλ᾿ ἐξ ἄλλων ἄλλας&gt; ἀμείβουσαι. An
alternative is to limit the corruption to ἀμείβουσαι. Mangey
ἀπομάττουσαι.</note>


<note n="3.194.2">MSS. σφόδρα γ᾿ εἰσὶν.</note>


<note n="3.194.3">The genitive is hardly defensible. Wend. proposes
ἀσπάζονται &lt;μεταδιδοῦσαι&gt;, Cohn τῇ . . . εὐκλείᾳ.</note>



<note n="3.195.a">Or “talents.”</note>




<note n="3.196.1">MSS. νεωτερισθέντες.</note>



<note n="3.197.a">So the LXX, which Philo takes to mean “for fear you yourself fall.” The E.V. “that thou bring not blood upon thy house, if any man fall from thence” gives the real sense better.</note>

<note n="3.199.a">The vow of the Nazarite is called (as in <hi rend="italic">Leg. All.</hi> i. 17)
“the great vow” from Numb. vi. 2 ὃς ἂν μεγάλως εὔξηται
εὐχήν (R.V. “a special vow”). For Philo’s interpretation
<hi rend="italic">cf. Quod Deus</hi> 89, 90, where also the contact with the corpse
is treated as an “involuntary” error.</note>




<note n="3.200.1">So MSS. Wend. ἀκουσίων, i.e. the ideal course is to avoid
both kinds of offence, the next best to avoid the “voluntary”
and to minimize the “involuntary.” But since the “occasions
of the involuntary are infinite” (§ 179), the ideal can rarely
be reached (§ 180).</note>



<note n="3.201.a">In <hi rend="italic">Quod Deus</hi> 90 they are not worth counting.</note>


<note n="3.201.b">Apparently meaning “<hi rend="italic">our</hi> motives for what <hi rend="italic">we</hi> have done.” Philo seems to be expressing in a curiously strong way the feeling that our “involuntary” errors are something quite independent of us. They treat us as strangers and we are taken aback when we find that they have happened.</note>
