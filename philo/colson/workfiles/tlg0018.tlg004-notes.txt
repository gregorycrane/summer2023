<note n="2.94.1">These words are regarded by Cohn as corrupt and the
result of an attempt to complete a sentence, the real ending
of which was illegible. His reasons are (1) that to describe
the δόξα as believing itself to be God’s handiwork is illogical;
(2) more important, that Ambrose, who translates the
passage almost literally, has “altera quae tamquam operatori
et creatori omnium Deo defert et eius tamquam parentis
atque rectoris subdit omnia gubernaculo.” Following this
Cohn supposes something as follows: τὴν δὲ τῷ θεῷ ἑπομένην
καὶ ἐπ᾿ αὐτὸν πάντα ἀναφέρουσαν ὡς πατέρα καὶ ἡγέμονα.</note>



<note n="2.95.a">That Philo takes the subject to be God appears clearly in 10; see note on <hi rend="italic">De Cher</hi>, 40.</note>


<note n="2.95.b">The meaning is shown in Ambrose’s (see p. 93) adaptation: “addito enim numero fit alius numerus, aboletur superior, et cogitatio nova excludit superiorem.” Possibly some equivalent of this has fallen out of the text.</note>




<note n="2.97.a">Or “received a vivid impression of each,” which agrees
better with the general meaning of φαντασιοῦσθαι, though
not so well with κατὰ τὴν τῆς φρονήσεως ἐπικέλευσιν.</note>


<note n="2.97.b">The LXX. has προσετέθη πρὸς τὸν λαὸν αὐτοῦ.</note>




<note n="2.98.1">The sentence does not make sense as it stands. In the
Papyrus there is a lacuna of four lines after τοιοῦτον followed
by ην θανατον.</note>



<note n="2.99.a">LXX. προσετέθη πρὸς τὸ γένος αὐτοῦ. See App. p. 488.</note>


<note n="2.99.b">The context perhaps slightly suggests that Philo took these words, which he quotes several times, as “stand with Me Myself.”</note>




<note n="2.101.a">LXX. ἐτελεύτησε διὰ ῥήματος Κυρίου, A.V. “according to the
word of the Lord.”</note>

πάππῳ &lt;καὶ διδασκάλῳ&gt; τῆς ἑαυτοῦ παιδείας.</note>



<note n="2.127.a">If the text is right, the idea may be that the father is
the father of his children’s education, and his father of his, and that therefore the grandfather’s influence extends to his grandson.</note>

<note n="2.133.a">See App. p. 490.</note>


<note n="2.133.b">The LXX. has τῶν Αἰγυπτίων. Note that this verse does
not assist the argument, which shows the nature of the
shepherd’s calling, but is introduced and explained merely
because of its close resemblance to Gen. xlvi. 34.</note>


<note n="2.133.c">See App. pp. 490, 491.</note>




<note n="2.134.1">MSS. μὴ χρονίσαι (some οὐ χρονίσεις).</note>


<note n="2.134.2">After θεοῦ perhaps a lacuna is to be supplied from
Ambrose who has “votum est autem postulatio bonorum a
deo <hi rend="italic">cum solvendi promissione.”</hi></note>




<note n="2.136.1">Cohn suggests τούτων τῶν κακιῶν.</note>



<note n="2.137.a">Or “wealth.”</note>


<note n="2.137.b">See App. p. 491.</note>




<note n="2.139.a">Philo deduces an allegory from ἐγκρυφίας (so the LXX.)
which means “cakes baked in the ashes.”</note>


<note n="2.139.b">Or “the things below them.”</note>




<note n="2.140.1">MSS. λόγῳ.</note>


<note n="2.140.2">Pap. ἑστῶτες, from which Wendland conj. ἑστῶτας.</note>



<note n="2.141.a">See App. p. 491.</note>


<note n="2.141.b">Philo in the following words plays with the double sense of πέσσω, (<hi rend="italic">a</hi>) bake, (<hi rend="italic">b</hi>) ripen and thus soften.</note>




<note n="2.142.1">To avoid the loose construction Cohn suggests παραδιδόντες
οὐ [γὰρ] εὐθὺς.</note>



<note n="2.143.a">Or “offers . . . carries out.”</note>


<note n="2.143.b">Or “pupils.”</note>




<note n="2.145.a">Literally, “overtakes their cessation.”</note>


<note n="2.145.b">The LXX. has ὅδε for ὧδε and of course does not intend
the meaning which Philo deduces of the omnipresence of
God. Similarly the elliptical phrase πρὸ τοῦ σέ means “before thou comest,” but the next words show that Philo took it as in the translation. <hi rend="italic">Cf. L.A.</hi> iii. 4.</note>


<note n="2.145.c">See App. p. 491.</note>





<note n="2.149.a">A strange use of νόμος, but neither Mangey’s εὐμενείᾳ
nor Wendland’s δυνάμει are satisfactory.</note>




<note n="2.151.a">That Philo gives this meaning to χίδρα is clear from
82 ff., but it is difficult to see what process he is thinking of. In the LXX. the word properly means “groats” and is the substantive to which the other three are adjectives.</note>




<note n="2.153.a">Or perhaps “using another figure,” literally “through
other things.”</note>


<note n="2.153.b">The LXX. no doubt means, as in our version, “thou shalt rise up before the hoary head.”</note>


<note n="2.153.c"><hi rend="italic">Cf.</hi> description of γραμματική in <hi rend="italic">De Cher.</hi> 105 and note in App. p. 485.</note>

<note n="2.154.2">Conj. Mangey ἀνάληψιν ἀκμὴν.</note>



<note n="2.155.a">Literally “old of old.” The real meaning of the verse presumably is “you shall have so much old corn, that you will cast it away when the new is ready.”</note>


<note n="2.155.b">Or “fix.”</note>


<note n="2.155.c">See App. p. 491.</note>




<note n="2.157.a">The whole verse in the LXX. is ἥψησε δὲ Ἰακὼβ ἕψημα,
ἦλθε δὲ Ἠσαῦ ἐκ τοῦ πεδίου ἐκλείπων. Philo deduces from the
juxtaposition of Jacob’s “seething” and Esau’s “fainting”
that the bad man’s power is destroyed by the fire of reason,
which subdues passion.</note>


<note n="2.157.b">See App. p. 491.</note>




<note n="2.159.a">γυμνάζω in ordinary use means simply “exercise.” But there is perhaps a play on its derivation from γυμνός.</note>




<note n="2.161.a">If the tense of ἠσθενηκότων is to be pressed the idea may be that Cain’s fruits, not being first-fruits, had lost their strength.</note>




<note n="2.162.1">So Cohn from Pap. ἀξιηκότερον. Other MSS. ἀξιοπιστότερον.</note>



<note n="2.163.a">In the Hebrew “Thou shalt break its neck.”</note>




<note n="2.165.a"> Literally “everything which comes after God is found
to have descended by a whole genus.”</note>




<note n="2.167.a">Nature here, as often in Philo, is practically identified
with the Divine Agency in things. Thus it is called in 100
“the uncreated.” Philo’s point is that, if blessings are
bestowed on us by nature, it does not follow that they are
worthy as offerings to the power behind nature.</note>




<note n="2.168.1">MSS. τὰ ὅσα ἀνθρώποις with variations.</note>



<note n="2.169.a">This sentence is added as another illustration of the truth
that what are ἀγαθά with men cannot necessarily be predicated
of God.</note>


<note n="2.169.b">See App. p. 486, note on <hi rend="italic">De Cher.</hi> 121.</note>


<note n="2.169.c">The word ‘separate’ is clearly used with reference to its use in Ex. xiii. 11, though there properly the thing set apart or separated was to be offered, not as here, discarded.</note>




<note n="2.171.a">Or, “a state of good affections”; see App. p. 495,
note on <hi rend="italic">Quod Det.</hi> 120.</note>




<note n="2.173.a">The R.V. has “so shall ye heave it,” and above “heave-offering.”</note>




<note n="2.175.a">Philo supposes that φύραμα is derived from συμφόρημα.</note>


<note n="2.175.b">Or “the impulses of either which accord with virtue.”</note>


<note n="2.175.c">Or “the wise being,” i.e. God.</note>




<note n="2.177.a">Philo absurdly derives ὄνος from πόνος and πρόβατον (probably correctly) from προβαίνω.</note>




<note n="2.179.a">Literally, “for the superfluity of external things.”</note>




<note n="2.181.a">See App. p. 491.</note>
