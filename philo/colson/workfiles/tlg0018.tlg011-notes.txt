distinguished: (<hi rend="italic">a</hi>) that of the soul stripped of passion, a
state which to Philo is true joy; (<hi rend="italic">b</hi>) foolishness, as in the
case of Noah (60 f.); (<hi rend="italic">c</hi>) ignorance of good and evil, as in
Adam and Eve (64 f.).</note>


<note n="3.321.b">The two epithets are explained in §§ 150–163. Ignorance is always blindness, but when under the delusion that it is knowledge it is actually mischievous (§ 163).</note>

<note n="3.332.1">MSS. ἐκτόπως.</note>



<note n="3.333.a">Philo connects -φλυγεῖν with φλέγω, though the word is rather to be connected with φλύζω, “bubble.”</note>


<note n="3.333.b">Philo has in mind the (unquoted) conclusion of Deut. xxi.
21, “and the rest when they hear it shall fear.” <hi rend="italic">Cf.</hi>also
<hi rend="italic">S.V.F.</hi>ii. 1175, where the Stoic idea of punishment as a

<note n="3.337.b">See App. p. 501.</note>




<note n="3.338.1">Or ψευδοδοξοῦσιν . . . ἀληθεύουσιν (Adler).</note>



<note n="3.339.a">The LXX has ἐξαίρομεν ἡμεῖς εἰς τὸν τόπον ὃν εἶπε Κύριος, where ἐξαίρω, as often, is used intransitively. Philo, however, for his allegory uses it transitively. The English “remove”
gives the double usage.</note>




<note n="3.340.1">παντὸς is suspected on the grounds that while Philo often
uses πάντων without the article, he regularly uses it with the
singular. Perhaps read πάντων ἡγεμόνος, or πανηγεμόνος, or
τοῦ τοῦ παντὸς ἡγεμόνος.</note>

<note n="3.349.a">i.e. Plato. The allusion is to the <hi rend="italic">Timaeus,</hi> where ὕλη

<note n="3.354.1">Wendland τοῖς τρόπον γυναικῶν ἔθεσιν ἁλισκομένοις. See App. p. 503.</note>



<note n="3.355.a">A.V. “tent,” R.V. “pavilion” (marg. “alcove”). No
reason seems to be known for the LXX translation. κάμινος
elsewhere always means “furnace,” a sense impossible in this
context.</note>


<note n="3.355.b">See App. p. 502.</note>




<note n="3.357.a">Apparently the thought is that the sea which blocked the way of the Israelites was Pharaoh’s ally. For “swallowed up” cf. Ex. xv. 4 (LXX κατεπόθησαν).</note>




<note n="3.358.1">Wendland suggested &lt;ὑστέρ&gt;ησαν, and τῆς ἀρετῆς, but
Adler’s argument for the MS. text, taking ὧν as dependent on
χορευταί and ἀρετὴν as acc. of respect, is convincing. The
phrase ἡμιτελεῖς τὴν ἀρετήν recurs <hi rend="italic">De Decal.</hi> 110.</note>



<note n="3.359.a">The connexion lies in the words “strong with God and mighty with men.” Philo equates God with the father
“reason” and men with the mother “convention.”</note>




<note n="3.360.1">The LXX has προνοοῦ, which perhaps should be read here.</note>



<note n="3.361.a">See App. p. 503.</note>

<note n="3.380.1">Or, as Adler, αὑτὸν γὰρ. Wendland proposed ὃν, omitting</note>



<note n="3.380.1">αὑτὸν, but the juxtaposition of αὑτὸν to ἑαυτῷ is very common and emphasis would be lost by its omission.</note>




<note n="3.383.a">Between ἀσθένειαν and τοῦ understand ἔξαρχοι καὶ ἡγεμόνες.</note>

<note n="3.384.2">Possibly μετὰ σοῦ as in MSS., and also in § 138.</note>



<note n="3.385.a">The translation takes καθαρός in the sense of “unmixed,”
i.e. with nothing to lighten its force. Possibly “in all its
purity.”</note>





<note n="3.388.1">Or perhaps, as Adler, the comma may be placed before
ἰδέας, which will then be taken as gen. sing.; see App. p. 505.</note>



<note n="3.389.a">See App. p. 504.</note>


<note n="3.389.b">The lacuna in the text may be filled up with some such words as τὰ ἱερουργούμενα.</note>





<note n="3.392.1">The uncompounded verb κατασκήπτω is not found in this
sense.</note>


<note n="3.392.2">Wend. wished to omit βιάζεσθαι, but the construction may
be paralleled by βλάψαι βιαζόμενον § 185. <hi rend="italic">Cf.</hi> also <hi rend="italic">De Sobr.</hi> 6.</note>



<note n="3.393.a">Lit. “declaring (his opinion) outright.” The thought seems to be that we may learn from the words not only that this particular law is eternal, but that all law in the true sense is necessarily (εὐθύς) so.</note>


<note n="3.393.b">See App. p. 505.</note>




<note n="3.394.1">Wendland corrected to παροινεῖν, but see App. p. 505.</note>



<note n="3.395.a">In what sense is Samuel a king? Perhaps as the hero of
the First Book of Kings and the king-maker.</note>


<note n="3.395.b">So the LXX. The words οἶνον καὶ μέθυσμα οὐ πίεται have
nothing corresponding to them in the Hebrew.</note>


<note n="3.395.c">So the LXX. In the Hebrew the words are spoken by Eli.</note>




<note n="3.396.1">Wendland corrects unnecessarily to τιθέμενον.</note>



<note n="3.397.a">Or, as Philo may have understood the words, “hard and easy,” taking ἡμέρα from ἥμερος, see App. p. 505. The E.V. has “of a sorrowful spirit.”</note>


<note n="3.397.b">Hesiod. <hi rend="italic">Works and Days</hi>, 287, 289–292.</note>




<note n="3.398.1">The LXX has ἐκχέω. But that Philo read the future is
shewn by ἀνιερώσω.</note>

<note n="3.409.b">See App. p. 507.</note>




<note n="3.410.1">MSS. προσαποσειομένους, which Wendland defends on the
strange ground that “shaking off their ears” may describe
the action of men trying to brush away the sound of the
music out of their ears. Cohn preferred ἀποσαττομένους,
which would give the same sense as ἀποκλειομένους (Mangey).</note>



<note n="3.411.a">Or (not so probably) ἀνεγειρομένους “starting from their seats,” συνηχοῦντας “taking up the tune.”</note>

<note n="3.421.b">Or “whatever their source” (or “authority”).</note>


<note n="3.421.c">It should be observed that the datives throughout this sentence are governed by τὰς αὐτάς at the end.</note>




<note n="3.422.1">MSS. ὑπ(ἀπ)ειλούσης. The correction ὑπεικούσης has been
universally accepted, but the phrase, “the second and yielding
one,” is odd. The translator suggests ὑπ᾿ εἶλ&lt;αρ&gt; οὔσης,
i.e. “which is thus under shelter.” The word εἶλαρ as used
in <hi rend="italic">Iliad</hi> ii. 338 etc. is very appropriate to the context, and
Philo is fond of introducing Homeric words.</note>


<note n="3.422.2">“ignorance of knowledge” is a strange expression. Adler proposes χηρούμενος for χρώμενος. Perhaps ἀγνοίᾳ &lt;ἀντ᾿&gt; ἐπιστήμης.</note>
