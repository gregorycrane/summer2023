<note n="4.134.1">MSS. ὅλης, which perhaps might be retained in the sense
of the “homestead as a whole.”</note>



<note n="4.135.a">Or “chamber,” <hi rend="italic">cf. Il.</hi> vi. 490 and elsewhere, where οἶκος
is clearly the inner part of the house. For the thought that
while mind has a wider range, its most intimate home is
speech, cf. the explanation of τὸν ἔγγιστα as speech in
<hi rend="italic">De Ebr.</hi> 71.</note>


<note n="4.135.b">Or “this is not the House of God, only (yet) there is a
House of God.” Mr. Whitaker defended his translation by
suggesting that Philo is following the occasional use of ἀλλ᾿ ἤ
in the LXX for “certainly,” e.g. 2 Chron. xix. 3. But the
explanation which follows seems to me to point to the
alternative translation given above, and in this case the use of ἀλλ᾿ ἤ would be something like that in Deut. iv. 12 (quoted in 48). In <hi rend="italic">De Som.</hi> i. 185 we have another way of taking the verse.</note>


<note n="4.135.c">Or “soul in the true sense of the word.” Philo means that he is not using the word in the wider sense of the whole soul or life of the animal, but for the mind or dominant principal. See App. p. 560.</note>




<note n="4.136.1">MSS. οὐκέθ᾿.</note>





<note n="4.141.a">“Things outside the body” (see note on <hi rend="italic">Quod Det.</hi> 7)

of the body” interpret Egypt.</note>


<note n="4.141.b">For the interpretation of these “works” or tasks as
slavery to the passions and the like <hi rend="italic">cf. De Conf.</hi> 93.</note>


<note n="4.141.c">Here begins the digression about Joseph which continues
to the end of § 24. The opening words of § 16 are a meditation
on Gen. 1, 26 “And Joseph died (ἐτελεύτησε. cf. μέχρι τῆς
τελευτῆς) and was buried, and they laid him in a <hi rend="italic">coffin</hi> (σορῷ),
in <hi rend="italic">Egypt</hi>. ” The lesson deduced is that the compromising Joseph-nature is “buried in the body” and forgotten, but it may have higher things or “bones”. These are remembered and serve to kindle excellence in others.</note>

<note n="4.147.a">The thought of §§ 26–30 seems to be that while ordinary
souls, typified by Israel leaving Egypt, must shun outward
temptations, because they will prove too strong for them,
even the Jacob-souls, who have proved their superiority, will
do well to detach themselves and become immersed in that higher wisdom represented by Isaac, which is beyond all worldly thoughts.</note>

<note n="4.177.d">The phrase ῥημάτων καὶ λόγων must not be confused with
the common collocation ῥ. καὶ ὀνομάτων (“verbs and nouns”) for speech in general. Here the ῥημάτων echoes the ῥήματα of the quoted text, and is then interpreted by λόγων (speech).</note>




<note n="4.178.1">MSS. σόφισμα.</note>



<note n="4.179.a">The sense of the section is that human thoughts being
in the charge of or inspired by God may be called God’s

things,” i.e. stands in the relation of God to the mouth.</note>


<note n="4.179.b">i.e. after Aaron had called up frogs over the whole land of Egypt.</note>




<note n="4.180.1">Mangey suggests κραταιοτέρᾳ.</note>





<note n="4.185.a">The force of περί would perhaps be given better by

<note n="4.185.b">Or “keeping of festivals (in general).” <hi rend="italic">Cf. De Spec.
Leg.</hi> ii. 41.</note>




<note n="4.187.a">Philo interprets the ὑπάρχοντα of the LXX (property), as
equivalent to the philosophical term ὑπαρκτά (really existing).
See App. p. 563.</note>


<note n="4.187.b">Or “ways of thinking” “attitudes of mind”; <hi rend="italic">cf. De Plant.</hi> 61.</note>




<note n="4.188.1">Perhaps ἐφίδρυται (G.H.W.); <hi rend="italic">cf</hi>. ἐφιδρύσεις of feet, <hi rend="italic">Leg.
All</hi>. iii. 138.</note>



<note n="4.189.a">This point, in which “hands” are clearly interpreted
by ἐγχειρήματα, and “feet” by ἐφορμεῖ καὶ ἐνίδρυται, follows
in the LXX after the statement that the laver was made out
of the mirrors of the women. In the Hebrew this does not
appear in this place, but the ordinance that the laver should
be so used comes in both Hebrew and LXX in Ex. LXX. 19 f.</note>


<note n="4.189.b">“Fasting,” in the spiritual sense of course, is interpreted
by καρτερίας. The word is used because in the LXX the
women who offered the mirrors fasted on the day when the base of the laver was made. The Hebrew word which seems to be obscure is given in A.V. as “assembled,” in R.V.
“serving.” By ἤδη Philo seems to mean that only when the “mirror” has been used for self-examination, and the
“feet and hands” of the soul cleansed, can the true offering of “fasting” be made.</note>


<note n="4.189.c">The προσ- in προσαναφλέγουσαι reproduces the προσεξέκαυσαν of the text. How Philo interprets the prefix appears in <hi rend="italic">Leg. All.</hi> iii. 234. The fire kindled by the senses is an <hi rend="italic">addition</hi> to purely mental troubles.</note>




<note n="4.190.1">Previous editions print παγκάλως with the preceding
sentence as adverb to χρησόμεθα. But this seems a little
overdone as praise of the more or less compromising life here
described. An examination of the other 35 examples of παγκ.
in the index shows that Philo generally uses it near the
beginning of the sentence, in nearly all in praise of some
saying or incident in Scripture, and in all in connexion with
some verb, expressed or implied, of speaking. The form
παγκάλως διὰ τοῦτο καί is exceptional, but differs very slightly
from the common διὰ τοῦτο παγκάλως.</note>



<note n="4.191.a">Or “the Logos as revealed in the High Priest.” The thought that the High Priest (in general, not Aaron in particular) represents the Divine Logos is worked out in <hi rend="italic">De Fug.</hi> 108 ff. In <hi rend="italic">De Gig.</hi> 52 the phrase is given a less exalted meaning.</note>




<note n="4.192.1">Mangey regarded this as corrupt and proposed κατὰ τὸ
εὐλογημένον αὑτὸν εἶναι. Possibly we might read τό &lt;τι&gt; εἶναι.</note>



<note n="4.193.a">In R. V. “Her food, her raiment, and her duty of
marriage.” By “fellowship” or perhaps “intimacy” Philo
may mean either that the νοητά are brought into close association
with the αἰσθητά, or that the soul is brought into
intimate touch with both.</note>


<note n="4.193.b">i.e. in being (something) as opposed to “seeming,” which was the keynote of the Fourth Gift. See critical note.</note>

<note n="4.199.a">i.e. the text speaks of his “curses,” though actually
there was no cursing at all.</note>


<note n="4.199.b">The translation supposes that Philo is alluding to the
Athenian office of σωφρονισταί, officials appointed to look
after the morals of the Ephebi in general and particularly
in the gymnasia. Philo certainly often introduces special
Attic terms from his reading. But it is at least as probable that the word here means “moral censors” in general, and sums up the various forms of guardianship which follow.</note>




<note n="4.200.1">Perhaps read εὐπαθείας. Elsewhere the plural is used
when in contrast with πάθη.</note>



<note n="4.201.a">λόγος seems to anticipate ῥῆμα. Otherwise we might

Ex. ii. 2 (LXX. ἀστεῖον: cf. Heb. xi. 23). The connexion of
thought in §§ 139–142 is as follows. The idea that Isaac’s
sacrifice typifies the offering of the soul’s consummation suggests
other thoughts about this soul-birth: (1) that the soul
is unconscious of what it is bearing, (2) that it comes in the ripeness of spiritual “old age”; and this contrast between Sarah and the Egyptians suggests a further contrast, namely that the Hebrew-soul needs no “midwife.”</note>

<note n="4.220.1">MSS. ἐνεργείᾳ.</note>



<note n="4.221.a">Philo takes ἐπιθυμίαν, which in the LXX. is a cognate
accusative representing the familiar Hebrew way of intensifying
the verb (though that more often employs the dative;
<hi rend="italic">cf. Leg. All.</hi> i. 90), as if it was the direct object of ἐπεθύμησεν.
The verb does occasionally take an accusative, though commonly the genitive, on which he falls back in the next words.</note>

<note n="4.226.1">μελιττῶν is my conjecture for the MS. μὲν αὐτῶν. See

<note n="4.227.a">The LXX has νὴ (some texts μὰ) τὴν ὑγίειαν Φαραώ, οὐ μὴ
ἐξέλθητε. Philo presumably found οὐ in his copy. It will
make the point a little more sensible, if we understand him
to take the words “I will not swear by the health of Pharaoh,
(but) you shall not go forth.”</note>


<note n="4.227.b">The meaning of the section seems to be as follows. To
the Israel mind the mixed cavalcade of Ex. xli. is confusion;
that of Gen. l. is not so to the Joseph mind. Moses regulates
his language in speaking of each multitude by what the two
minds would think of them.</note>


<note n="4.227.c">Though Wend.’s punctuation evidently takes Mamre (as no doubt it is) as nom., Philo’s language shews clearly that Mamre is, not has, the κλῆρος. That he should so take it, is not surprising. Except here and perhaps in Gen. xiv. 13, he would find no suggestion that Mamre was a man. It is either a town or occurs in the phrase ἡ δρῦς Μαμβρή. Even in Gen. xiv. 13 the words might without violation of grammar be so taken as to avoid such a suggestion.</note>




<note n="4.228.1">Wend. prints ὀφθαλμοὶ γὰρ ἑρμηνεύεται τῷ κτλ. without

<note n="4.228.4">MSS. ἀμίλλης ἁμείνων.</note>



<note n="4.229.a">The gist of this and the preceding sections may be
summed up thus. When the Abraham soul of Gen. xiv. has been trained by journeyings with the εὐφυής and the φιλοθεάμων, it will rise to the stage of the Abraham of Gen. xxii., who went <hi rend="italic">together</hi> with Isaac, that is διδακτικὴ ἀρετή side by side with αὐτομαθὴς ἀρετή When this higher stage is reached, the old antithesis between labour and natural gifts, between art the imitator and nature the creator, is wiped out.

<note n="4.256.1">MSS. αἰσθήσεσι.</note>



<note n="4.257.a">I understand these two sections to contain, not so much
advice to soothe an angry man by pretending to conform to
his views and wishes, as a description of the right attitude
of the mind to αἴσθησις and πάθος. It is well, when we feel
or see the ebullience of passion in ourselves or others to come
down from the contemplation of νοητά and accommodate
ourselves to outward things. Afterwards the mind may
return to the care of its proper charges (τῶν ἰδίων), the mind being thought of as the shepherd of the herd of νοητά; <hi rend="italic">cf. De Mut.</hi> 114. But see App. p. 566.</note>


<note n="4.257.b">i.e. because Haran is the place of αἴσθησις.</note>

<note n="4.261.a">Philo here seems, as not unfrequently, to use εὐπάθεια in a
more general sense, not as in §§ 119 and 157 in the strict
Stoic sense of justifiable emotions.</note>




<note n="4.262.1">Wendland and Mangey τῇ ἐκεχειρίᾳ. The reading here
printed is, according to Wend., that of all MSS. except H<sup>2</sup>.
Wend. later (<hi rend="italic">Rhein. Mus.</hi> liii. p. 34) repudiated ἐκεχ. and was
inclined instead to adopt a suggestion of Cohn, ῥαστώνῃ, based
on <hi rend="italic">De Sacr.</hi> 37. But the phrase οὐ τῇ ἑτέρᾳ ληπτόν (not to
be caught with one hand) is a quotation from Plato, <hi rend="italic">Soph.</hi>
226 MSS., where it is said to be a proverbial phrase (τὸ λεγόμενον)
and there is no reason to doubt its genuineness here. See
further App. p. 566.</note>


<note n="4.262.2">MSS. προβολῆς.</note>



<note n="4.263.a">Or “one with which we must be content.” The word is generally used of something we accept in default of something better. What that is in this case has been shewn in § 46. There is a higher realization than seeing, viz. possessing, but that is not given to men.</note>




<note n="4.264.1">MSS. μὴ δὲ.</note>


<note n="4.264.2">So all MSS. except H<sup>2</sup>; this has τοῦ . . . ἐπιβούλου, which
Wend. adopts.</note>


<note n="4.264.3">Wend. suggested and later (<hi rend="italic">Rhein. Mus.</hi> lviii. 34)
accepted ἐρασταί. But see <hi rend="italic">De Ebr.</hi> 94, where Simeon is
φιλήκοος, “for his name means ἀκοή.”</note>



<note n="4.265.a">Or “tribunals.”</note>


<note n="4.265.b">The phrase is apparently an interpretation of the next
word, ἀσφαλῶς, which itself is taken from the LXX εἰσῆλθον
εἰς τὴν πόλιν ἀσφαλῶς. This word, which in the E.V. is
translated “unawares” (margin, “boldly”), was presumably
understood by the LXX translators as “running no risks
because the Shechemites were disabled.” Philo reads into
it the thought that Virtue must fortify itself against Vice
before it can take the offensive.</note>


<note n="4.265.c">A reference to LXX Gen. xxiv. 25 ὅτε ἧσαν ἐν τῷ πόνῳ. where πόνος refers to their disablement from circumcision (E.V. “when they were sore”). This strangely-used word comes in happily for Philo’s allegory of Shechem as the false πόνος.</note>


<note n="4.265.d">Philo takes great liberties with the story, ignoring the actual seduction of Dinah (μιαίνειν ἐπεχείρησεν) and the circumcision of Hamor and Shechem (ἀπεριτμήτῳ πόνῳ). He gives, however, a sort of apology for this in § 225 by suggesting that in the spiritual sphere the defilement of the truly virtuous soul, and the “circumcision” of the truly wicked, are only illusory.</note>
