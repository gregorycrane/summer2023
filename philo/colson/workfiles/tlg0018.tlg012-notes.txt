<note n="3.447.a">Philo reads into νεωτεροποιία, in which νεωτερο- means “innovation,” the idea of νεώτερος, “younger.”</note>


<note n="3.447.b">βιάζεσθαι followed by the inf. is used by Philo in the sense of “to do a thing violently,” cf. note on <hi rend="italic">De Ebr.</hi> 143.</note>




<note n="3.449.a">Exod. xv. being the “lesser song” of Moses; <hi rend="italic">cf. De Plant.</hi> 59.</note>


<note n="3.449.b">See App. p. 510.</note>




<note n="3.450.1">MSS. ἀρετῶν or εὑρετῶν: Adler suggests ἀρετῆς υἱῶν.</note>


<note n="3.450.2">Wendland reads for the μετὰ τῶν ἀγαθῶν τὰ δοκήσει of
the MSS. μετὰ τῶν νόθων &lt;οἷς&gt; τὰ δοκήσει and inserts ἀγαθῶν
after παραριθμουμένων, producing the same meaning as the
text here printed (after Adler), but with less transcriptional
probability.</note>



<note n="3.451.a">So, with slight differences, the LXX. The Hebrew is entirely different.</note>


<note n="3.451.b">These words interpret the ηὐξημένος of the quotation.</note>




<note n="3.452.1">MSS. ἕνδεκα.</note>



<note n="3.453.a">There is a play here on γῆρας and γέρας. If it is worth
keeping, we might translate “by advance of years—of
advance in honour.” <hi rend="italic">Cf. Quis Rer. Div. Her.</hi> 291, where
γῆρας is said to be τὸ γέρως ἀδελφὸν καὶ παρώνυμον.</note>


<note n="3.453.b">See App. p. 510.</note>


<note n="3.453.c">The sense would be clearer without ὡς ἱεροφάντας. As it stands, it must mean that the common opinion looks upon the old in age as the proper persons for such high functions. But νομίξειν ὡς is a rare construction.</note>




<note n="3.455.a">Or “take as his familiars.”</note>


<note n="3.455.b">Philo argues that the age (in the literal sense) of the two sons is shewn by the <hi rend="italic">order</hi> in which the motherhood of the two wives is mentioned. This meaning would come out more clearly if we read προτέραν . . ὑστέραν.</note>




<note n="3.457.a">See <hi rend="italic">De Ebr.</hi> 48 (and note).</note>




<note n="3.458.1">Wendland ἐν μνήμαις ἀδιαστάτοις.</note>



<note n="3.459.a"><hi rend="italic">Cf. Leg. All.</hi> iii. 90–93.</note>




<note n="3.460.1">MSS. ἐκ(ἐγ)γελάσας.</note>


<note n="3.460.2">See App. p. 510.</note>



<note n="3.461.a">See App. p. 511.</note>




<note n="3.462.1">MSS. δύνηται.</note>




<note n="3.464.1">Conj. Tr. κατ᾿ ἀφροσύνην &lt;καὶ σύνεσιν&gt;. The last two
words, which are needed for antithesis, may easily have fallen
out before καὶ συνόλως.</note>


<note n="3.464.2">So Wendland for MS. περιουσίαν, which perhaps in the sense of “abundance” is not quite impossible: Cohen παρουσίαν.</note>


<note n="3.464.3">Conj. Tr.: Wendland ὑπηκόων: Adler πολίτων.</note>



<note n="3.465.a">Here we have Philo’s favourite idea of the three elements of education, φύσις, διδασκαλία, ἄσκησις, usually typified by Isaac, Abraham and Jacob. <hi rend="italic">Cf.</hi> note on <hi rend="italic">De Sac</hi>. 5–7 (Vol. I. App. p. 488).</note>


<note n="3.465.b">Or possibly ἀγαλμάτων may mean the “ideas,” cf. § 3.</note>




<note n="3.466.1">Wendland conj. ἀλλ᾿ ἤδη.</note>




<note n="3.468.1">So MSS. Wendland needlessly changed to λόγῳ, i.e. savagery must be eliminated by reason, but see <hi rend="italic">De Ebr.</hi> 33.</note>


<note n="3.468.2">So Wendland conjectures, though he prints the MSS. κατ᾿ αὐτοὺς. Grammatical usage seems to demand the change.</note>


<note n="3.468.3">Conj. Tr.: MSS. ἐκτὸς: Wendland from Nicetes Serranus (see App. p. 511) ἡσυχίαν καὶ μονὴν.</note>




<note n="3.470.1">Wendland πρὸς τὸν Κάιν, and αὐτὸν for τὸν φαῦλον. See
App. p. 511.</note>


<note n="3.470.2">For the meaningless ἔχοντα, ἐξῆς or ἐχομένως or εὐχάς τε
have been suggested. The last suits the sense well, as the
sequel deals with the blessing more than the curses. The
Translator suggests as better accounting for the corruption
τὰς δ᾿ ἀρὰς &lt;καὶ τὰ μὴ ἀρὰς&gt; ἔχοντα.</note>



<note n="3.471.a">See App. p. 511.</note>


<note n="3.471.b">In the LXX, as usually and rightly printed, ἥμαρτες is
the apodosis of οὐκ ἐὰν ὀρθῶς προσενέγκῃς, ὀρθῶς δὲ μὴ διέλῃς.
Philo here and in <hi rend="italic">De Mut.</hi> 195, takes it as beginning a
fresh sentence. <hi rend="italic">Cf. De Agr.</hi> 127. So in <hi rend="italic">Quaest. Gen.</hi> i.
64, 65 “Quid est, non quod non recte offeras, sed quod recte
non dividas? . . . Quid est ‘ peccasti, quiesce’?”</note>


<note n="3.471.c">Probably, as Adler suggests, in the lost discourse on Noah’s “nakedness.” See Introduction to <hi rend="italic">De Ebr.</hi> p. 309.</note>


<note n="3.471.d">i.e. Shem is by interpretation ὄνομα, which may mean either “name” or “noun.” In either case as representing the generic as opposed to the specific names or nouns, it is equivalent to the best of the genus. <hi rend="italic">Cf.</hi> a similar argument, <hi rend="italic">Leg. All.</hi> iii. 175. See App. p. 512.</note>




<note n="3.473.a">The LXX has “My servant” (τοῦ παιδός μου), which
Philo uses in <hi rend="italic">Leg. All.</hi> iii. 27. The Hebrew has no equivalent.
See App. p. 512.</note>


<note n="3.473.b">See App. p. 512.</note>




<note n="3.474.1">διὰ τοῦ] MSS. αὑτοῦ or αὐτῷ: Mang. ἐν τῷ.</note>



<note n="3.475.a">See App. p. 512.</note>




<note n="3.476.1">Wendland suggests ἀναφέρεται.</note>




<note n="3.478.1">Wendland changed this to εὐλογίαν, but the MS. reading makes quite fair sense.</note>


<note n="3.478.2">So Cohn and Wendland. The πρόλογος of the MS. does not make sense. For the correction <hi rend="italic">cf. De Plant.</hi> 117.</note>


<note n="3.478.3">MS. ἔγραψε μὲν: Wendland suggests τῶν σπουδαίων ἔγραψεν ἕνα.</note>



<note n="3.479.a">Or “God’s thought,” the Divine Logos being here
regarded as plural. The allusion is to Gen. xxxii. 1, “The
angels of God met him,” which comes shortly before the
story of the wrestling in verses 24 f.</note>


<note n="3.479.b">In the LXX βασιλεῖον ἱεράτευμα, where βασιλεῖον no doubt means “royal.” Philo’s interpretation is, however, grammatically possible.</note>


<note n="3.479.c">Or “describes the man of worth as praying for one” etc.</note>
