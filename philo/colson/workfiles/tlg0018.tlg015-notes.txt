<note n="4.345.b">Clearly, to suit the heifer, ψυχή must here be used in the

<note n="4.345.c">Rhetoric is here conceived of as a means of defending the innocent, and therefore a safeguard against injustice.

<note n="4.365.a">The point of the sentence is not clear. Perhaps he
means that, as we have already shewn (§ 99) that day and
night are essentially equal, Moses, by putting them at the
outset of the creation story, praises equality. Or the stress
may lie on ἀνὰ μέσον as in itself indicating equality (so
in § 166). But in this case γάρ is unintelligible. Perhaps
correct to ἄρα.</note>

given in § 132, where the three parts were ψυχή, λόγος (as
speech) and αἴσθησις. The best we can make of it is that here ψυχή is the whole ψυχή in its wider sense, there in the sense of the mind or ψυχὴ ψυχῆς (cf. § 55). But even so we shall not get consistency. See note on § 125.</note>

<note n="4.413.a">The irrelevance of these five sections to the disquisition
on “ecstasy” led Mangey to consider them an interpolation
from another treatise. But the irrelevance does not differ
in kind from Philo’s other ramblings, and we have a sort of
apology for it in § 256. The remarks are based on the texts
quoted to illustrate the second sense of “ecstasy” in § 251.
He feels that though they were quoted for that purpose,
they each have their moral which he does not wish to omit.</note>

<note n="4.413.c">The allegory of §§ 252–254 is very confused. Jacob “hunts,” i.e. supplants, πάθος symbolized by Esau (though elsewhere Esau is rather folly). But the game he brings so quickly (a sign as in <hi rend="italic">De Sac.</hi> 64 and elsewhere of gifts sent direct from nature and God) turns out to be the qualities of the “Practiser.” These qualities are submitted to the testing soul before πάθος can enter it, otherwise their flavour would be lost. Here Esau is still πάθος, but the next moment he is rather the worthless man hunting in a sense for the good, but failing through procrastination and slackness, and thus a contrast to the zeal of the man of worth. This zeal for the good implies an equal zeal to flee from evil, and the texts in § 255 illustrate this.</note>

<note n="4.424.1">MSS. and Pap. ἐγγραφεὶς.</note>


<note n="4.424.2">A noun seems to be wanted either as a substitute for or
in addition to ἅπασι. Wend. suggests προπαιδεύμασι or
παιδεύμασι (or perhaps μαθήμασι).</note>



<note n="4.425.a">See App. p. 575.</note>


<note n="4.425.b">μετ’ εὶρήνης or ἐν εἰρήνη of LXX is of course intended to go with ἀπελεύσῃ.</note>




<note n="4.326.1">The insertion by Wend. corresponds in length nearly with some illegible words in Pap. It is omitted altogether in MSS.</note>


<note n="4.326.2">MSS. and Pap. κρινομένου.</note>


<note n="4.326.3">Perhaps, as Wend. conjectures, μέλλουσι.</note>



<note n="4.427.a">See note on <hi rend="italic">De Sac.</hi> 79.</note>


<note n="4.427.b">Mangey took this to mean “whose souls have departed,”
“quorum animae demigrarunt,” and he might have alleged
in support <hi rend="italic">De Sac.</hi> 10 τὴν πρὸς τὸν ὄντα μετανάστασιν ψυχῆς of Moses’ death. But apart from the singular ψυχη, such a description of the death of the “fathers” would be pointless here, and the allegorical use of μετανίστασθαι and kindred words throughout this meditation (e.g. § 274) leaves no doubt that the words are to be taken as in the translation.</note>




<note n="4.428.1">My correction for MS. and Pap.? δι᾿: Wend. proposed
ἔτι δ᾿.</note>



<note n="4.429.a">στοιχεῖα being the regular term for the letters of the
alphabet.</note>


<note n="4.429.b">See App. p. 575.</note>


<note n="4.429.c">i.e. Philo is willing to accept this explanation of “fathers,” if with the four elements for the body is coupled the fifth for the soul.</note>




<note n="4.430.1">The sentence seems imperfect as it stands; either read
as Mangey &lt;ὁ&gt; γαληνὸν κτλ. SC. ἐστι or more likely a verb has
been lost: Wend. ἀπελεύσεται (or perhaps ἄπεισι after τραφεὶς).</note>


<note n="4.430.2">SC. and Pap. δυνάμενον or μὴ δυνάμενον: Mangey’s text
has βασιλεῦσιν . . . μὴ δυνάμενον.</note>

<note n="4.435.a">The phrase is apparently intended to be the converse of
the Platonic thought of the wise man studying to die to the
body, <hi rend="italic">cf. De Gig.</hi> 14. But it seems strange, and Mangey
suggested λανθάνοντα. Possibly φθάνοντα, which would carry
on the thought of ὀλιγοχρονιώτατον.</note>

God as wishing to bring the people to the Holy Land

<note n="4.440.1">MSS. and Pap. ἔτι ἐνδίολκον, a word otherwise unknown,
though retained in the lexica. It is difficult to see on what
principles it is formed.</note>


<note n="4.440.2">So Pap. and some MSS.: others μῆ παρέργως, a very common collocation in Philo, cf. (e.g.) § 40. So Mangey.</note>



<note n="4.441.a">Or “remain unable,” etc.</note>


<note n="4.441.b">Lit. “not unnecessarily.” Or, if we read παρέργως (see crit. note), “thoroughly and carefully.”</note>




<note n="4.442.1">τοῖς . . ἀγγέλοις MSS. and Pap.: Wend. corrects to ταῖς
. . . αὐγαῖς. For προσχωροῦντος (so Wend.) the MSS. have
προσχορεύοντες or προχορεύοντες (Pap.?): Mangey ἐγχορεύοντες.
See App. p. 575.</note>


<note n="4.442.2">Wend. inserts συγκραταιοῦν from Pap. which apparently
has κραταιουν preceded by a space, or illegibility, of some
kind, which he regards as representing three letters. But
συγκραταιόω is unknown to the lexica, and if it exists must
be transitive, and we should expect τροφήν rather than
τροφῆς. If Pap. is to be followed, I should suggest ὡσεὶ (or οἷα) κραταιὸν. But, as in § 76, I have thought it better to omit it.</note>



<note n="4.443.a">For the construing of the fate of Nadab and Abihu as an exaltation by fire to heaven <hi rend="italic">cf. Leg. All</hi>. ii. 58.</note>




<note n="4.444.1">κρίσεις is the reading of the MSS. (Pap. not stated): Wend.
unreasonably, as it seems to me, even if he finds it in Pap.,
corrects to κρίσις.</note>


<note n="4.444.2">The last part of this sentence is
 noted by Wend. as
corrupt. I suggest and have translated καθ᾿ ἥν τὰ σύμπαντα

<note n="4.447.a">There is evidently a play on the resemblance of Εύφράτης and εὐφροσύνη; cf. its description as εὐφαίνοντα τὴν διανοίαν <hi rend="italic">Leg. All.</hi> i. 72.</note>
