<note n="2.419.a">An attempt has been made in the translation to render
the passage as though no words were missing. But it is

We suggest that the text should be printed thus—τὸ μὲν

<note n="2.438.1">Mangey felt that the text here can hardly be right. It fails to make distinct the antithesis between inward and outward, on which the next sentence dwells. He suggested τὸ θειότατον, τὸν ἐν ἡμῖν λογισμόν. Other possible changes
are τι θειότερον, τὸν ἐν ἡμῖν λογισμόν, or τὸ θειότατον τῶν ἐν ἡμῖν, λογισμόν.</note>
