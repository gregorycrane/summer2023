<note n="7.8.1">So R: other MSS. ἀνοσιότητος.</note>



<note n="7.9.a">See note on <hi rend="italic">Spec. Leg</hi>. i. 332.</note>




<note n="7.10.1">MSS. πόλεως.</note>




<note n="7.12.1">So MSS. and Cohn. But I should prefer with Mangey to
omit ἀπ᾿. I do not know of any case in which οὐρανός includes
the lower air, as the text implies, while on the other hand the
index gives thirteen examples where heaven, air, water, earth
are named as the four parts of the universe. See <hi rend="italic">Spec. Leg.</hi>
iii. 111, and <hi rend="italic">cf. ibid.</hi> 152. With ἀπ᾿ omitted each of the four
makes its contribution, earth being given by πέτρας.</note>



<note n="7.13.a">Or “hard,” “flinty.” Here, as in <hi rend="italic">Mos</hi>. i. 210–211, Philo does not stress the connexion of the word (taken from Deut. viii. 15), with ἀκρός as he does elsewhere. See note on <hi rend="italic">Mos</hi>. i. 210. The events alluded to are found in Ex. xv. and xvi.</note>




<note n="7.14.1">MSS. πέντε and MSS. Cohn by an oversight afterwards corrected
in a note to Treitel’s translation. This must be a
mistake of the scribe. Philo could not possibly have made it;
<hi rend="italic">cf. Spec. Leg.</hi> ii. 58, and the more elaborate explanation of the
even-odds in <hi rend="italic">De Op.</hi> 13.</note>



<note n="7.15.a">For the Pythagorean origin of the term παντέλεια as applied to ten see note on <hi rend="italic">De Abr</hi>. 244.</note>


<note n="7.15.b">This does not seem to mean more than that all the properties and mysteries of numbers must necessarily fall within the decimal system, for “round ten as a turning-point the unlimited series of numbers wheel and retrace their steps,”
<hi rend="italic">De Op</hi>. 47.</note>


<note n="7.15.c"><hi rend="italic">i.e</hi>. improper or proper fractions.</note>




<note n="7.17.a">Lit. “which exceeds and is exceeded by the same number.”
See App. p. 609.</note>


<note n="7.17.b">See the more detailed explanation in <hi rend="italic">De Op</hi>. 109, where the example given is that 6, 8, 12 are in harmonic progression because 8 exceeds 6 by 1/3 of 6, and is exceeded by 12 by 1/3 of 12. Here as often the ordinal is used for the cardinal.</note>




<note n="7.19.a">This seems to be the meaning, thought both ὅροι and γεννάω
are used in a different sense from what they have in the earlier
part of the sentence, where the ὅροι generate by addition to each other. Presumably the μυριάς is not named as a new starting-point,
because Greek has no special term for ten myriads or beyond.</note>


<note n="7.19.b">Or perhaps “both the product and sum,” <hi rend="italic">cf. De Op</hi>. 13. But the essence of “perfection” lies in the sum, as exemplified by 28, <hi rend="italic">cf. Mos</hi>. ii. 84 and note.</note>




<note n="7.20.1">MSS. καίων. Clearly it must correspond with the passive
following. But Aristotle in <hi rend="italic">Categ.</hi> has καίω and καίομαι as
his examples.</note>


<note n="7.20.2">So Mangey with most MSS. Cohn σχεδόν with M. Though
the addition of τι may perhaps rather point to σχεδόν I do 
not see what it can mean here. σχέδην regarded as the adverb of σχέσις, often used by Philo in contrast with κίνησις (see particularly <hi rend="italic">De Sobr</hi>. 34), seems quite appropriate here.</note>



<note n="7.21.a">On the categories see App. pp. 609–610.</note>


<note n="7.21.b">Or “shear.” κείρω seems to have been a favourite word for exemplifying the force of the three voices. See note on <hi rend="italic">De Cher</hi>. 79.</note>




<note n="7.22.1">MSS. συνεστηκὼς or -ὸς or -ότα.</note>


<note n="7.22.2">Cohn prints ἀνάπλεω, which appears in one MSS. but I
cannot discover any authority for this form of the acc.</note>



<note n="7.23.a">Or perhaps “just as musical instruments (and therefore the sounds which they make) are subject to decay.”</note>




<note n="7.25.a">Gen. xvii. 1 LXX; E.V. “I am God Almighty.”</note>


<note n="7.25.b">I have punctuated and translated this sentence in the
only way which seems to me possible, if the text is to stand,
i.e. I have placed a comma after ἑκάστῳ instead of (as Cohn)
after ἀπαγορεύων, and understand ἐκκλησιάζει or διαλέγεται
after ὅτε δὲ and take τῶν ἐμφερομένων as partitive after πρακτέα = “among the contents of his speech.” But it is exceedingly awkward and some corruption is probable. For further discussion see App. p. 610.</note>





<note n="7.29.a">For this and the next section see Ex. xix. 14–19.</note>


<note n="7.29.b">So LXX, Ex. xx. 18, <hi rend="italic">cf. De Mig.</hi> 47, <hi rend="italic">Mos.</hi> ii. 213.</note>





<note n="7.33.a">Greek “the other planets,” the sun and moon being regarded as planets.</note>


<note n="7.33.b">See App. p. 610.</note>




<note n="7.34.1">MSS. μυθογράφους or -οις.</note>



<note n="7.35.a">Or “sparkler,” “twinkler.” For these non-mythological
names of the planets see <hi rend="italic">Quis Rerum</hi> 224.</note>


<note n="7.35.b"><hi rend="italic">Od</hi>. xi. 303. See App. p. 610.</note>




<note n="7.37.a">So, I think, rather than as Mangey “utique solius” or
Treitel “ausschliesslich,” which would rather be μόνου.</note>




<note n="7.39.a">Mangey strangely says that the brothers are the angels.
But clearly they are the heavenly bodies, which are “souls
divine and without blemish throughout” (<hi rend="italic">De Gig.</hi> 8, where see note), though elsewhere, as in <hi rend="italic">De Op</hi>. 144, admitted to have bodies. Philo always, I think, distinguishes them from angels.</note>


<note n="7.39.b">Here begins the Second Commandment.</note>




<note n="7.41.a"><hi rend="italic">Cf. Iliad,</hi> xvii. 32, and Hesiod, <hi rend="italic">Op.</hi> 218 παθὼν δέ τε
νήπιος ἔγνω, quoted as a proverb Plato, <hi rend="italic">Symp.</hi> 222 B.</note>




<note n="7.43.a">Philo clearly has in mind Ps. cxv. 5–8; <hi rend="italic">cf. Spec. Leg</hi>. ii. 256.</note>




<note n="7.44.1">MSS. τρέψασθαι.</note>


<note n="7.44.2">So Cohn from the αἰγυπτίων of some authorities. The
αἰγύπτω of the majority agrees well with χώρας, though not
so well with the plurals which follow.</note>



<note n="7.45.a">Rather a strange phrase for mankind, but justified by the antithesis to χειρόκμητα. Possibly our “brethren,” the stars, which would also have to worship the images, if they were worthy of worship, are included.</note>


<note n="7.45.b">For other references to Egyptian animal worship see App. pp. 610–611.</note>





<note n="7.49.a">See note on <hi rend="italic">De Som.</hi> i. 44.</note>




<note n="7.50.1">See App. p. 611.</note>



<note n="7.51.a">For this double function of “Conviction” or the “Inward
Monitor” <hi rend="italic">cf. Quod Deus</hi> 135 ff.</note>




<note n="7.52.1">So Cohn by a later correction for MS. τὰ μὲν αὐτῶν. See
App. p. 611.</note>




<note n="7.54.1">Other MSS. θεὸν, which Cohn prints, though later he
declared for σελήνην, which appears in R. See App. p. 611.</note>



<note n="7.55.a">See App. p. 611.</note>




<note n="7.56.1">MSS. ἓν ἑξάμετρον or ἑξὰς μέτρον.</note>




<note n="7.59.a">i.e. in <hi rend="italic">Leg. All.</hi> i. 2–4: “Moses wished to exhibit things
mortal and immortal as having been formed in a way corresponding
to their proper numbers”(§ 4). The reason why six
is the appropriate number for mortal things, as seven for
immortal, is given just before.</note>


<note n="7.59.b">For the Pythagorean origin of these epithets see note on
<hi rend="italic">Mos.</hi> ii. 210.</note>


<note n="7.59.c">Or “archetype.”</note>


<note n="7.59.d">For the mystical identity of One and Seven <hi rend="italic">cf. De Post.</hi> 64,
<hi rend="italic">Quod Deus</hi> 11, and § 159 below.</note>


<note n="7.59.e">This whole section, like its parallel, <hi rend="italic">De Cher.</hi> 22, is based upon Plato, <hi rend="italic">Timaeus</hi> 36 C-D, where the heaven is conceived of as consisting of two revolving circles, the exterior, the sphere of the fixed stars, and the interior subdivided into seven concentric circles, one for each planet. “The exterior motion he called the motion of the Same (ταὐτόν, <hi rend="italic">cf</hi>, Philo’s ταυτότης), the interior the motion of the Other” (so in <hi rend="italic">De Cher</hi>.). The terms for “undivided” and “he divided” are ἄσχιστος and σχίσας, but Plato has ἀμέριστος and μεριστὴ οὐσία a little before (35 C-D).</note>




<note n="7.60.1">So Cohn for MS. πρὸς τὰ πέντε. See App. pp. 611–612.</note>



<note n="7.61.a"><hi rend="italic">Cf</hi>. Plato, <hi rend="italic">Laws</hi> 821 C-D, where the name of “wanderers” is said to be a blasphemy.</note>





<note n="7.64.1">MSS. ἀνθρώπων.</note>



<note n="7.65.a">Clearly an allusion to the Attic law by which a citizen
nominated to perform a “leiturgia” might call upon a person
not so nominated whom he considered to be wealthier than
himself to exchange properties with him. Here, as often, Philo shews his knowledge of Attic law, as he found it in Demosthenes.</note>


<note n="7.65.b">The sense is “the natural and proper thing is for beasts to learn from men; in this case men have to learn from beasts.”</note>


<note n="7.65.c">i.e. these animals come to associate the human form with kindness.</note>


<note n="7.65.d">See App. p. 612.</note>




<note n="7.67.a">See App. p. 612.</note>




<note n="7.68.1">Or, as Mangey, read τούτου.</note>




<note n="7.70.1">Cohn with some MSS. ἀποδεικνύουσιν, but the MSS. authority
is almost as good for the singular, which seems better suited</note>



<note n="7.70.1">to the context than the plural, which would presumably have ἀπάται or τέχναι for its subject. The sequel refers to adultery in general rather than the deceptions which usually accompany it.</note>




<note n="7.73.a">Literally “blending of temperaments or characteristics.”
See note on <hi rend="italic">Mos.</hi> ii. 256.</note>




<note n="7.74.1">So R, other MSS. ἱερώτατον: Cohn proposes as an alternative &lt;κάλλιον&gt;, ἱερώτατον agreeing with φῶς.</note>




<note n="7.76.1">Perhaps read, as Cohn later, διότι. See note <hi rend="italic">d.</hi></note>



<note n="7.77.a">i.e.the jurymen.</note>


<note n="7.77.b">Perhaps understand the jurymen, but the analogy of § 91
points rather to “oaths.”</note>


<note n="7.77.c">It will be seen that Philo extends the meaning of the
word from covetousness of what is another’s to desire in
general, and this enables him to enter on a disquisition on
the four passions of the Stoics. Driver notes that the Hebrew word also is general and only gets its bad sense from the context. For some analogies with Stoic phraseology see App. p. 612.</note>


<note n="7.77.d">The logic of “therefore” is not at all clear; neither, however, is Cohn’s later substitute of “because.” Perhaps however χαλεπά may be taken—“baneful” or “evil,” and Philo is, as so often, insisting on the difference in guilt between voluntary and involuntary sins.</note>




<note n="7.78.1">So Cohn by a later correction for ἐκβιασάμενον, in which
the prefix seems very inappropriate. One MS. gives ἐμβ-. No such verb is known to the dictionaries, but it has the analogy of ἐμβάλλω.</note>


<note n="7.78.2">MS. ἐλαύνει.</note>




<note n="7.80.1">For text see App. p. 613.</note>


<note n="7.80.2">MSS. γίνεται.</note>



<note n="7.81.a">For the use of ἐπουρίξω (here intransitive) see note on <hi rend="italic">De Ab.</hi> 20 and <hi rend="italic">Mos</hi>. i. 283.</note>




<note n="7.82.1">MSS. τοῦτο.</note>


<note n="7.82.2">Cohn (in note to Treitel’s translation) ναυμαχικαῖς. But, even if the word exists, which seems doubtful, I see no reason for the change.</note>




<note n="7.84.1">Cohn suggests αὐτὸς on the ground that the stress lies on
each man sacrificing himself.</note>



<note n="7.85.a">Or “the number seven.” See App. p. 613.</note>


<note n="7.85.b">Six is the most creative of numbers, because its factors
2 and 3 represent the odd (or male) and the even (or female)
principle. See <hi rend="italic">De Op.</hi> 13.</note>


<note n="7.85.c">The seventh (or seven) which does not include six, seems
to mean that in view of the mystical identity of seven and
one (see on § 102) a feast which occupies one day only may
be regarded as coming under the law of the seventh day.</note>


<note n="7.85.d">Or perhaps “supersedes it.” The verb, derived from
the adverb ἐπίπροσθεν, seems to be used of a thing which gets
in front of something else and obscures it (<hi rend="italic">Spec. Leg.</hi> iv. 52).
So here the idea may be that the unit or monad does not
need six to make it equivalent to seven.</note>


<note n="7.85.e">The seven feasts which follow are enumerated again in <hi rend="italic">Spec, Leg.</hi> ii. 41 and described at length in the following sections. They appear there, however, in the order in which they occur in the year and are not classified according to the number of days observed. Also there are three which do not appear in this list, the Sabbath itself, the feast of “Every Day ” and the monthly New Moon. The first of these is of course implied here, and the omission of the second is not unnatural, but it is curious that the New Moon should be left out. Has τὴν νουμηνίαν fallen out before τήν τε ἱερομηνίαν?</note>


<note n="7.85.f">Or opening of the holy month, see App. pp. 613–614.</note>




<note n="7.86.1">MSS. καὶ.</note>


<note n="7.86.2">Perhaps, as Mangey suggests, ἔτους (or ἐνιαυτοῦ) has fallen
out. <hi rend="italic">Cf.</hi> Josephus, <hi rend="italic">Ant.</hi> xi. 8. 6 τὸ ἑβδοματικὸν ἔτος . . . οὐδὲ γὰρ
αὐτοὺς σπείρειν ἐν αὐτῷ. But why add λεγομένου? It sug- gests rather that the simple τὸ ἑβδ. had become a recognized phrase for the sabbatical year.</note>



<note n="7.87.a">i.e. Unleavened Bread and Tabernacles, but the latter had eight days. See <hi rend="italic">Spec. Leg.</hi> ii. 211.</note>


<note n="7.87.b">According to the ordinary inclusive reckoning each equinox occurs in the 7th month after the preceding.</note>




<note n="7.88.1">MSS. χρησάμενος.</note>


<note n="7.88.2">MSS. περαιοῦται.</note>




<note n="7.90.1">So Cohn for MS. ἐπαντλοῦντας. But strict grammar
requires ἐπαντλῶν.</note>


<note n="7.90.2">Mangey corrected to ἀνίεραι (ἀνίεροι?), “neque sane
actiones ἱεραὶ possunt ab impuro fonte cupiditatis profluere.”
But an antithesis is clearly required and the deed may
remain “sacred” though done from an impure motive.</note>



<note n="7.91.a">I understand this to refer to cases where a man repays a small sum or returns a small deposit in order to induce the other party to entrust him with something greater which he can embezzle. Philo has referred to this form of dishonesty in <hi rend="italic">De Cher.</hi> 14 and <hi rend="italic">De Plant.</hi> 101. One would expect it to come under the head of stealing, but Philo notes it in <hi rend="italic">Spec. Leg.</hi> iv. 67 under the ninth commandment. Possibly, however, it may refer more generally to the false assumption of a truthful air.</note>




<note n="7.93.a">Or “fuel.”</note>


<note n="7.93.b">I do not think that Treitel and Mangey bring out the
full sense of this. The essential characteristic of God as θεός
is goodness, <hi rend="italic">cf. e.g. Spec. Leg.</hi> i. 307. It is in His other
aspect of κύριος that He gives the commandments, and is
indeed the κολαστικὴ δύναμις, but the goodness of θεός is so far extended to κύριος that the execution of punishment, and indeed here the sentencing, is entrusted to subordinates. For a similar thought to this <hi rend="italic">cf. De Fuga</hi> 66.</note>
