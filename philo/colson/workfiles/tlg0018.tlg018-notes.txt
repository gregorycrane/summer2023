But a better antithesis to αἴσθησις seems to be required.
Perhaps &lt;νοῦ&gt; ἰσχύν.</note>


<note n="5.144.4">That θεόπτης is unknown elsewhere, except in quite late
writers, is hardly sufficient reason for expunging it, as
Wendland following Cohn does. Philo might easily coin it.
But it cannot be taken with τῆς ἀειδοῦς φύσεως, and seems pointless if taken by itself. Wend, himself conjectured θεοπρόπος. I should prefer ἐπόπτης, a well-known term in the mysteries and differing enough from θεάτης to give it some point.</note>

<note n="5.148.1">MSS. ὡς ἐν ὀνόματι τῶ κυρίω: Wend. prints following the
text as quoted in the <hi rend="italic">Parallela</hi> of Joh. Damasc. (D) ὡς ἂν ὁ
ὢν ὀνόματι τοιούτῳ. At the same time for ὡς ἂν ὁ ὢν he conjectures
ὁ ἀκατονόμαστος ὢν. I do not indeed see how the
text of Joh. Dam. can be construed as it stands, and have
followed in the main the MSS. text, substituting with J. D.
ἂν for ἐν and correcting τῷ κυρίῳ to κυρίῳ τῷ, a correction
perhaps supported by J. D. τοιούτῳ.</note>


<note n="5.148.2">So Mangey: MSS. ὀνόματι: Wend. τὸ ὄνομα (from Joh.
Dam.). See App. p. 586.</note>


<note n="5.148.3">Perhaps, as Wendland conjectures, ὑπηρετοῦσαι. Any
use of the middle seems to be later than Philo.</note>



<note n="5.149.a">Philo seems to mix in this passage two somewhat different uses of the grammatical term κύριον ὄνομα: (1) a noun used in its literal or strict sense, opposed to metaphorical or loose usage (ἐν καταχρήσει, see note on <hi rend="italic">De Cher.</hi> 121); (2) a proper or personal name.</note>


<note n="5.149.b">See App. p. 586.</note>


<note n="5.149.c">Philo seems to mean that while το ὄνομά μου κύριον will naturally mean “my name κύριος,” the text should (or perhaps may also) be regarded as an “hyperbaton” or “unusual order” of ὄνομά μου τὸ κύριον, “my proper name” For the technical use of the term see App. pp. 586 f.</note>




<note n="5.150.1">MSS. μήτ᾿.</note>


<note n="5.150.2">MSS. περιιππεύων. I have left the text as Wend. prints
it, but it is not satisfactory: περιέπειν is rather “to honour,”
and if it is read we should expect τοῦ κόσμου, or as Mangey
τὰ κόσμου governed by μετεωρολεσχῶν. Perhaps περιάπτων.
<hi rend="italic">cf. De Ebr.</hi> 73. But the periphrasis with ἦν is in itself
somewhat strange.</note>



<note n="5.151.a">I understand ἀοράτῳ, for which Mangey would substitute
ἀρρήτῳ, to refer to the wrestling of the story taking place at night and stopping at dawn. Wendland suspected ἐπιστάτῃ and proposed παλαιστῇ, but Philo conceives of the angel rather as a master of the contest (ἀγωνοθέτης) training his pupil by wrestling with him; <hi rend="italic">cf. De Som.</hi> i. 129.</note>




<note n="5.153.a">i.e. at the beginning of the speech to which the earlier
quotation, “Behold I give thee etc.,” belongs. But as another quotation has intervened, this is rather forced. I should like to read ἐν ἀρχῇ, καί, i.e. “as an opening phrase.”</note>




<note n="5.154.1">MSS. αἱρεῖται.</note>


<note n="5.154.2">MSS. ἡμῶν.</note>


<note n="5.154.3">οὕτως and ἑκείνως are my corrections of the οὖτος and ἐκεῖνος of the MSS. and editors. It seems clear to me that the sentence explains ἡγεμονεύεσθαι and εὐεργετεῖσθαι of the preceding clause and refers to the τελεῖος only.</note>




<note n="5.156.1">The MSS. and editors have this sentence as follows:
ἀλλὰ μὴ νομίσῃς τὸν αὐτὸν τρόπον ἄνθρωπόν τε γίνεσθαι καὶ
ἄνθρωπον θεοῦ· ἄνθρωπον μὲν γάρ, θεοῦ ὡς κτῆμα· ἄνθρωπον
δὲ θεοῦ, ὡς αὔχημα καὶ ὠφέλημα. The changes I have introduced,
though involving little textual alteration, viz. the
insertion of θεοῦ in one place, and the change of ἄνθρωπον
θεοῦ twice over to ἀνθρώπου θεόν, make a vital change in the
thought. As the text stands in the MSS. there is little point
in the antithesis between being a man simply and being
God’s man, and the next sentence does not carry on
the antithesis, but indicates one between man being God’s
and God being man’s. Moreover αὔχημα and ὠφέλημα should
be genitives in apposition with θεοῦ. The thought in the
corrected text is as follows: The phrase “I am thy God”
makes God to be man’s. “Moses the man of God” makes man to be God’s. But the two relations are different. Man is God’s because he is God’s possession. God is man’s only in the sense that he can glory in Him and gain help from Him. He then continues “if we wish to establish this latter relation we must first establish in the right way the former and thus become not merely God’s possession, which we are in any case, but a possession worthy of Him.”</note>

<note n="5.194.2">MSS. σχημάτων.</note>



<note n="5.195.a">The suggestion of Mangey and Wendland to explain away
this extraordinary perversion of the story of Jethro’s visit to
Moses by transferring the negatives seems to me quite
untenable. If it brings the passage into better agreement
with the LXX, it does so at the cost of making nonsense of
the whole, by representing something which is to Jethro’s
credit as being to his discredit. Moreover, the text as it stands
substantially agrees with the account of the interview given
more shortly in <hi rend="italic">De Ebr.</hi> 37. Philo apparently gets his
interpretation by stopping short at v. 17 of Ex. xviii. and
ignoring the rest. Moses has said that he teaches the
people “the ordinances of God and the law,” and Jethro
replies οὐκ ὀρθῶς ποιεῖς. The sequel goes on to shew that
Jethro means that Moses should employ subordinates for minor matters, and the last part of § 104 seems to be a vague reproduction of this, but completely twisted, whether through perversity or lapse of memory, so as to describe a policy of injustice called in <hi rend="italic">De Ebr.</hi> “playing the demagogue, and laying down laws contrary to the laws of nature.”</note>


<note n="5.195.b"><hi rend="italic">Prima facie</hi> no doubt we should take ὁ μέγας as meaning Moses, particularly as Moses in the story does accept Jethro’s suggestion. But in view of the impossibility of Philo ascribing to Moses the acceptance of such advice, I take it generically, and this fits in with the evidently intended antithesis to μεγάλοις μεγάλα.</note>


<note n="5.195.c">The Greek might mean “assigns important administrations of justice, etc.,” but here again the overwhelming argument of the necessity of discrediting Jethro demands the translation given. Philo is perhaps thinking of Deut. i. 17, and xxiv. 13–16, where the thought suggested in the translation appears.</note>




<note n="5.196.1">MSS. στόματα.</note>


<note n="5.196.2">So Wend. for MSS. ἐπήεσαν: better perhaps as Mangey
ἐπίεσαν.</note>



<note n="5.197.a">i.e. ἐκ κρίσεως may be taken as a single word ἐκκρίσεως,
or as “belonging to judgement,” though in ἐκ λήθης (§ 100)
the ἐκ is supposed to indicate the opposite of the noun.</note>


<note n="5.197.b">See App. p. 589.</note>


<note n="5.197.c">Or “mouth above skin” (or “leather,” cf. δερμάτινον
ὄγκον Βεελφεγώρ, <hi rend="italic">De Conf.</hi> 55). I take the application to be
that δέρμα indicates the body, and, if the form given in the translation is right, ἀνωτέρω suggests that in this case the body has usurped the superiority which belongs to the mind.</note>


<note n="5.197.d">A strange use of τρανός. No satisfactory emendation is suggested. Wend.’s τρανὸς &lt;λόγος&gt; is fairly satisfactory in itself, but the λόγον which follows is an objection.</note>


<note n="5.197.e">For σειρομάστην and other points in this sentence see the parallels, <hi rend="italic">Leg. All.</hi> iii. 242, <hi rend="italic">De Post</hi>. 183, <hi rend="italic">De Ebr</hi>. 73, and notes thereon.</note>

is no allusion to the original meaning of the word, and the
derived sense of “is lost” may be given in the translation.</note>


<note n="5.199.b">προβάσεις evidently alludes to the idea that πρόβατον is derived from προβαίνω, <hi rend="italic">cf. De Sac.</hi> 112 προκοπῆς δὲ πρόβατον, ὡς καὶ αὐτὸ δηλοῖ τοὔνομα, σύμβολον.</note>


<note n="5.199.c">This is explained later in § 246.</note>




<note n="5.200.1">MSS. πευστέον.</note>



<note n="5.201.a">The thought is obscure. Cohn and Wend. proposed
ἀγώγιμον παραδιδόναι τοῖς φαινομένοις (or πρὸς τὰ φαινόμενα).
If the text is kept, I suggest that the thought may be that
while the mind holds its proper seat, it makes the right use
of αἰσθητά, but if it is enticed out into the body-loving region,
αἰσθητά are used by it as slaves or prisoners. This would be
brought out more clearly if we made the easy correction
καὶ &lt;ἐκεῖ&gt; παραδιδόναι. But Mangey’s emendation of ποιμαινόμενα for φαινόμενα would greatly simplify the imagery and deserves all consideration. See App. pp. 589 f.</note>


<note n="5.201.b">If this is right περίαπτα is used in a somewhat different sense from § 199 for “appendages”; cf. Aristot. <hi rend="italic">Nic. Eth.</hi> x. 8. 12 οὐδὲν δὴ προσδεῖται τῆς ήδονῆς ὁ βίος αὐτῶν, ὥσπερ περιάπτου τινός. For τραγῳδία <hi rend="italic">cf. De Post.</hi> 165 οἱ τραγῳδίαν τὸν βίον . . . νομίζοντες. But the words may refer to the masks of actors, and if so would be more in line with §§ 198, 199.</note>

<note n="5.204.1">&lt;σώζεται&gt;: my insertion, which I hope will meet with
general acceptance. That Philo should have supposed that
“Hoshea” meant “this person of a particular kind” seems
to me absurd (for Siegfried’s defence of it see App. p. 590).
Philo’s meaning, as I understand it, is that the finite verb
necessarily implies a subject and therefore stands to the
abstract noun as the ποιός does to the ποιότης or ἕξις. It will
be seen that the juxtaposition of two -εται’s might easily lead
to the omission of one. For the interpretation of a name by
a finite verb cf. below, § 189.</note>


<note n="5.204.2">So Mangey (approved by Wend.): MSS. ποιά, which
cannot mean “of any kind,” and if we take it as “some
particular kind” does not balance well with παντός.</note>



<note n="5.205.a">ποιός (a person of a particular kind) is regularly used in antithesis to other ποιοί or ἄποιοι; but it may also be used in antithesis to ποιότης, <hi rend="italic">cf</hi>., ποιόν τι ἀλλ᾿ οὐ ποιότητα, <hi rend="italic">Theaetetus</hi> 182 A. In this case the ποιός is the concrete of the abstract ποιότης. Philo has used it in exactly the same way in <hi rend="italic">Leg. All</hi>. i. 67, 79, and also in <hi rend="italic">Leg. All</hi>. ii. 18, where ὁ κατὰ τὰς ἀρετὰς ποιός is φρόνιμος or σώφρων, etc., corresponding to φρόνησις, σωφροσύνη, etc.</note>




<note n="5.206.1">MSS. ἦ.</note>


<note n="5.206.2">MSS. καθαρσίω.</note>


<note n="5.206.3">Perhaps τὸ δέ γε &lt;τόδε&gt; καὶ.</note>



<note n="5.207.a">Or “a thing received,” the natural meaning of the word,
i.e. Moses is named after the gift which he has received.</note>


<note n="5.207.b">The meaning is obscure. Perhaps the fact that Moses
“handled” the laws shews that his name of “receiving”
must also be understood to include the kindred meaning of “handling.” The derivation here given applies only to the last part of the name. The common ancient derivation that “Mo” represented the Egyptian μῶυ, “water,” is given by Philo, <hi rend="italic">De Mos</hi>. i. 17, In <hi rend="italic">Leg. All.</hi> iii. 231 ψηλάφημα was used for “groping” (in darkness).</note>


<note n="5.207.c">Clearly an allusion to the blessing of Levi (Deut. xxxiii. 9), “who said to his father and mother ‘I have not seen thee’ (οὐχ ἑώρακα)” <hi rend="italic">Cf. De Fug.</hi> 89 and elsewhere. Mangey and Wend, needlessly suspect the word.</note>




<note n="5.208.1">MSS. θεὸς, which Wend. prints, though noting that
ἄνθρωπος θεοῦ seems the right reading. But θεοῦ by itself is
a simpler and, I think, quite sufficient correction.</note>


<note n="5.208.2">Wend. puts no stop at μεγαλαυχῶν, apparently treating
it as “boasting on account of this (what?) in particular.”
Mangey gives a full stop after μεγαλαυχῶν, but inserts &lt;εὔχεται&gt;
after ἥκιστα. I suggest that θεός ἐστι is to be understood;
see note b on opposite page. τοῦτο looks forward, as <hi rend="italic">e.g. De
Op.</hi> 72, 100, <hi rend="italic">De Som.</hi> i. 118.</note>


<note n="5.208.3">Wend. and Mangey both punctuate γέλως, ὁ ἐν διάθετος
υἱὸς θεοῦ (which Drummond translates “the ideal son of
God”). But can ἐνδιάθετος mean this? I understand it in
its usual sense of opposition to προφορικός, <hi rend="italic">cf. De Mig.</hi> 157 τοῦ ἐνδιαθέτου καὶ σπουδαίου γέλωτος, and so below § 154 τὸν ψυχῆς γέλωτα.</note>



<note n="5.209.a">Philo, as often, connects εὐλογιστία with εὐλογία. See note on <hi rend="italic">De Sobr.</hi> 18.</note>


<note n="5.209.b">The thought is: Moses’ “godship” to Pharaoh was particularly shewn in his not punishing him summarily, but allowing him so many chances of repenting, and in interceding with God for him, e.g. Ex. ix. 29.</note>




<note n="5.210.1">An alternative to supposing a lacuna may be obtained
by emending φιλόκαλον to φιλόκακον (or better ἀφιλόκαλον,

<note n="5.210.2">So Mangey suggests: Wend. prints ἡ [ὁ κόσμος] εἱμαρμένη:
MSS. ἢ ὁ κόσμος εἱμαρμένη. I see no reason to exclude
ὁ κόσμος, which naturally suggests “order” as well as
“world.” Wend. also puts a question at παιδεία, as if σκῆπτρον
began an explanation of another of Judah’s gifts. Clearly this is not so. The staff suggests (1) immovableness, (2) discipline, (3) royalty. I suggest &lt;ἡ&gt; ἀκολουθία.</note>

<note n="5.227.a">This perversion of the laughter of Abraham and Sarah has some excuse in the case of the latter in the obscurity of

<note n="5.228.1">MSS. ὑπομορφάζειν.</note>


<note n="5.228.2">αὖ τὸν &lt;νοῦν&gt;: my correction for αὐτὸν in MSS. and all editions. As the text stands, αὐτόν can only refer to Joseph
and this is hardly sense. How could the arrival of the brethren, always representing the good, cause Joseph already more or less corrupted by Egypt to change for the worse? The sequel clearly shows that it is the brethren and Jacob in particular whom they hope to corrupt. But συνετράφη and παρακόψαντα forbid us to correct to αὐτοὺς. The suggestion of αὖ is not necessary to the sense, but it enriches it, as well as diminishing the departure from the MSS.. Egypt hopes to do with the new arrivals what it has already done with Joseph. This is supported by § 173, where the ills which will be inflicted on them are those which Joseph has already suffered.</note>




<note n="5.230.1">Wend. suggests ἐπ᾿ &lt;ἀγαθὰ&gt;, and adds “certe corruptela
latet.” I doubt whether there is anything very unusual in
this use of ἐπί with the genitive.</note>



<note n="5.231.a">i.e. at present only the brethren representing virtue at

I should suggest τοῖς ἐνενηκονταέταις &lt;καὶ ἑκατονταέταις&gt; οὖσι.
The latter word occurs in the narrative of Gen.

<note n="5.240.1">&lt;δεκάτων&gt;: my insertion. Wendland proposes ἑτέρας
δεκάτας &lt;ἑκάτοστον&gt; λόγον περιέχουσας or δεκάτην ὡς ἀπαρχὴν
ἱεράν: Mangey δεκάτην ἑκατόστῳ λόγῳ ἱεράν. I do not know
why they preferred these wide departures from the MSS. to
the obvious correction which is printed above. The periphrasis
with λόγος for the ordinal is quite common, as their
conjectures indeed admit, and I do not think the plural is
any objection.</note>


<note n="5.240.2">&lt;δεκάδος&gt;: again my insertion. Wend. &lt;δευτέρας&gt;, in which
I can see no meaning. Ninety is certainly the borderland
between ten and a hundred, which is here called the tenth
ten to bring out the analogy with the veil which separates the ἅγια.</note>


<note n="5.240.3">I suggest τὰ ἅγια &lt;τῶν ἁγίων&gt; τῶν ἁγίων (the holy place
from the holy of holies), <hi rend="italic">cf. Leg. All.</hi> ii. 55. This will bring out more clearly the correspondence with the first and the tenth ten. Perhaps also insert διὰ after τρόπον, in which case the form of the sentence will be the same as τοῦτον (eight words) τὸν τρόπον <hi rend="italic">De Conf.</hi> 69.</note>



<note n="5.241.a">For this use of φέρω see note on <hi rend="italic">Quis Rerum</hi> 36. So also in § 256 below. In § 225 the use is somewhat different, as there φέρειν precedes τίκτειν.</note>


<note n="5.241.b">i.e. ἐν τῇ διανοίᾳ αὐτοῦ must under this second interpretation be understood not, as in the first interpretation, as indicating a passing thought, but as “sincerely.” Though Philo does not state this expressly, it is implied by the antithesis with κατὰ τὴν διάνοιαν τῆς παρθένου below.</note>

<note n="5.244.6">Is this word, often used by Philo of impressing a stamp, appropriate to this case where Simeon is wholly absorbed? I suggest ἐνέναξε. The compound is not noted in the lexicon, but νάσσω exactly expresses the idea. Or ἐνέπλασε (W.H.D.R.).</note>

<note n="5.254.4">The lacuna might be filled by ἀπιστεῖ δὲ τῷ γενητῷ, cf. § 201 (rather this than §178 as Wend.).</note>



<note n="5.255.a">The objection of Cohn and Wendland to the first person ignores the fact that Philo constantly regards the stories and sayings of the Pentateuch as representing the spiritual experiences of every generation. It is “the holy word speaking to everyone,” as just above in § 215. Compare νοῦς ἡμῶν in § 16. Good examples appear in <hi rend="italic">De Som</hi>. i. 143 and 226, ii. 170. Cohn’s εὐχώμεθα does not fit in well with Philo’s use of παγκάλως (see note on <hi rend="italic">De Mig.</hi> 101). There would be no objection to εὐξόμεθα, but the change seems unnecessary.</note>

<note n="5.275.a">Wendland gives the reference for this as Ex. xvi. 23 ff.
But this can hardly be right, as no manna fell on the Sabbath. The reference is clearly to the Sabbatical year of Lev. xxv. 4, 5, definitely called “Sabbath,” on which he has dwelt in <hi rend="italic">De Fug.</hi> 170 ff. ἡ ἑβδόμη seems to be used for ἑβδομάς in <hi rend="italic">De Decal.</hi> 159 and <hi rend="italic">De Spec.
