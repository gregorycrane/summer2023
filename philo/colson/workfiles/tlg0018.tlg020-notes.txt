<note n="6.5.a">i.e. the Deluge and the destruction of Sodom and
Gomorrah. Philo classes these two together, ignoring the
purely local character of the latter. Compare his treatment
of the two in <hi rend="italic">Mos.</hi> ii. 52–65, and <hi rend="italic">cf. ib.</hi> 263.</note>

<note n="6.9.a">Philo uses “Chaldaean” as a synonym for Hebrew
frequently in these works, though not in the treatises contained
in Vols. I.-V.</note>


<note n="6.9.b">This argument, founded on Gen. iv. 26, LXX “He called
his name Enos; he hoped to call on the name of the Lord
God” (E.V. “then began men to call upon the name of the
Lord”) and on the fact that Enos is a poetical Hebrew term
for “man,” has already been given in substantially the same
form in <hi rend="italic">Quod Det.</hi> 138.</note>


<note n="6.9.c"> μέλαν being the regular word for “ink.”</note>


<note n="6.9.d"> The 1st Archon was called simply ὁ ἄρχων, the 2nd ἄρχων βασιλεύς, the 3rd ἄρχων πολέμαρχος, the other nine θεσμοθέται. The addition of ἐπώνυμος (“who gives his name to dates,” etc.) seems to be a later use.</note>




<note n="6.11.a">So in <hi rend="italic">Quod Det.</hi> 139 that “the hoper is written in the
book of God” is deduced from “this is the book of the
generation of men” following on Gen. iv. 26. Of course the
phrase introduces what is coming on and begins a fresh paragraph.
For a similar misunderstanding cf. the treatment of
Gen. ii. 4, in <hi rend="italic">Leg. All.</hi> i. 19, and of Gen. vi. 9 in § 31 below.</note>


<note n="6.11.b">Enos as Adam’s grandson would naturally be third, or,
if Abel and Cain are reckoned, fifth. Philo may obtain the number he requires by omitting either Abel, because in Gen. iv. 25 Seth is spoken of as a substitute for him, or Cain as accursed. See App. p. 597.</note>


<note n="6.11.c"> Or “praiseworthy.” See Lev. xix. 24 “In the fourth year the fruit shall be holy and αἰνετός to the Lord.” In <hi rend="italic">De Plant</hi>. 119, Philo takes αἰνετός (probably rightly) as meaning something for which we may praise the Lord. So, too, in <hi rend="italic">De Som.</hi> i. 33, though there it is the fourth year which is αἰνετός. Here the adjective is applied to the number itself and, as the sequel shews, means worthy of praise.</note>


<note n="6.11.d"><hi rend="italic">De Op.</hi> 47 ff.</note>




<note n="6.13.a">Gen. v. 24. The LXX version “Enoch was well-pleasing
to God, and he was not found because God translated him” (E.V. “Enoch walked with God: and he was not; for God took him”) is familiar from Hebrews xi. 5. See App. p. 597).</note>




<note n="6.14.1">ἐπουρίσας] so Cohn, but the text is very doubtful. Some MSS. have ἐπορθιάσας εὐπορίας (with variations of order and
spelling), others ἐπουριάσας or ἐπουριάς. The natural sense of
ἐπουρίζω (lit. “direct with a fanvouring wind”) seems by itself strange in this context. I should prefer to read ἐπορθιάσας ἐπ᾿ οὐρίας (“pricked up and ready to catch any chance”). It is true that ἐπορθιάζω is not used elsewhere with ὦτα, but ἀνορθιάζω is several times so used by Philo. See further on <hi rend="italic">Mos.</hi> i, 283.</note>




<note n="6.17.a">“Unnatural movement of the soul” is a phrase used

<note n="6.21.a">Gen. vi. 9, <hi rend="italic">cf. Quod Deus</hi> 117.</note>


<note n="6.21.b">i.e. “a man, a just one.” As the Greek adjective needs
no substantive expressed, ἄνθρωπος, which would be otherwise superfluous, must have a special emphasis. Assuming, as Philo does, that the LXX follows the usage of classical Greek, the argument has some weight.</note>





<note n="6.25.a">LXX Gen. vii. 11 “the fountains of the abyss were broken
up.”
By the Hebrew word translated in the LXX by ἄβυσσος
is understood the “ocean which both encircled the world,
and occupied the vast hollows beneath the earth” (Driver).
Philo seems to represent the first part of this conception by “the great sea or deep,” and the second by the “perennial fountains.”</note>

insertion of αὐτούς.</note>

<note n="6.35.a">Philo seems to assume that the command to leave
country and kindred, cf. Gen. xii. 1, was given to Abraham
in Chaldaea and not in Haran. So perhaps the A.V. “the Lord had said,” as against the R.V. “the Lord said.” Philo may have implied the same from Gen. xv. 7, <hi rend="italic">Cf.</hi> Acts vii. 2.</note>





<note n="6.39.a"> Gen. xi. 31 and xii. <hi rend="italic">5</hi>. For the meaning of “another place” see on § 85.</note>




<note n="6.41.a">The allegorical meaning of Haran is given more fully
and clearly in <hi rend="italic">De Mig.</hi> 176 ff. and <hi rend="italic">De Som.</hi> i. 41 ff. Haran being the place of sense-perception is the bodily tenement of the mind (<hi rend="italic">De Mig.</hi> 187), and therefore stands for Socratic self-knowledge as a whole in contrast to astrological speculation. It thus gives the conviction that there is a higher power than mind and thus leads to the second migration from self-knowledge to knowledge of God.</note>




<note n="6.42.1">MSS. συνέξοντος.</note>



<note n="6.43.a">Gen. xii. 7. But this “appearance” comes when Abraham
is in Canaan. If Philo is following Genesis carefully the μετανάστασις must embrace both migrations. But the sequel suggests that he mistakenly assigns it to the Haran period.</note>




<note n="6.45.a"> Gen. xvii. 5. For the interpretation of Abram and Abraham (Greek Abraam) <hi rend="italic">cf. De Cher.</hi> 4, 7, <hi rend="italic">De Gig.</hi> 62, 64, <hi rend="italic">De Mut.</hi> 66.</note>




<note n="6.47.a">Gen. xii. 9. LXX “And Abram departed and having
journeyed encamped in the wilderness.” E.V. “And Abram
journeyed going on still towards the south.” Philo conveniently
ignores the earlier movements of Abraham in Canaan and fastens on the ultimate goal—the wilderness, as a symbol of the solitude of the mystic.</note>

is a sufficient ground for extracting an allegorical
lesson.</note>
