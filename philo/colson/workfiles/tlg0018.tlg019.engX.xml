<head>On Dreams</head>
<div type="textpart" subtype="book" n="1">
<head>Book I</head>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="1"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="1"/> The treatise before this one embraced that first

class of heaven-sent dreams, in which, as we said, the Deity of His own motion sends to us the visions which are presented to us in sleep. In the present treatise we shall, to the best of our ability, bring before our readers dreams which find their right place under our second head.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="2"><p> The second kind of dreams is that in

which our own mind, moving out of itself together with the Mind of the Universe, seems to be possessed and God-inspired, and so capable of receiving some foretaste and foreknowledge of things to come.<ref target="5-295-a"/> 
The first dream belonging to the class thus indicated is that which appeared to the dreamer on the stairway of Heave:</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="3"><p> “And he dreamed, and

behold a stairway set up on the earth, of which the top reached to heaven, and the angels of God were ascending and descending upon it. And the Lord stood firmly on it; and He said, ‘I am the God of Abraham thy father and the God of Isaac; fear not; the land whereon thou sleepest, to thee will I give it, and to thy seed; and thy seed shall be as the sand of the earth, and shall spread abroad




<pb n="297"/>

to the west and the south and the north and the east; and in thee shall be blessed all the tribes of the earth, and in thy seed. And, behold, I am with thee, guarding thee in every way by which thou goest, and will bring thee back into this land, for I will by no means forsake thee, until I have done all things whatsoever I have spoken unto thee’” (Gen. xxviii.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="4"><p> 12–15). The vision is introduced


by a prefatory passage necessary for its understanding,
and if we study this in detail we shall perhaps be able easily to grasp the meaning of the vision. What then is this prefatory passage? It runs thus: “And Jacob went out from the Well of the Oath, and made his journey to Haran; and he met with a place; for the sun set; and he took one from the stones of the place, and put it under his head, and he slept in that place” (<hi rend="italic">ibid.</hi> 10 f.); and then at once follows the dream.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="5"><p> It is worth while, then, at the


outset to investigate these three points, firstly, what “the Well of the Oath” is and why it was so called; secondly, what “Haran” is, and why it is that on coming out from the Well aforesaid he comes at once<ref target="5-297-a"/>  to Haran; thirdly, what “the place” is, and why, when he reaches it, the sun sets, and he himself goes to sleep.
<milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="2"/> Let us consider the first to begin with.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="6"><p> To me,

then, the Well seems to be a symbol of knowledge; for the nature of knowledge is to be very deep, not superficial; it does not display itself openly, but loves to hide itself in secrecy; it is discovered not easily but with difficulty and with much labour. And all


<pb n="299"/>

this may be seen not only in branches of knowledge
which contain a whole multitude of important problems, but in the simplest<ref target="5-299-a"/>  studies as well.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="7"><p> Just

choose any art you please, not the best of them I beg of you, but the most ignoble of them all, which perhaps no free man whatever brought up in a city would voluntarily practise, and even in the country
a servant who has to grapple with a harsh and
ill-conditioned master, who forces him to many a
distasteful task, would only undertake reluctantly.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="8"><p> For it will be found to be not a simple but a subtle

matter, one “which needs both hands to take it,”
hard to discover and hard to master, a foe to
hesitation and negligence and indifference, demanding abundance of zest and enthusiasm, of hard toil and anxious thought. This is why the diggers
of this well say that they found no water in it (Gen. xxvi. 32),inasmuch as the ends pursued in the different branches of knowledge prove to be not only hard to reach, but absolutely beyond finding.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="9"><p> That is why

one man is a better scholar or geometrician than another, because no limit can be set to the extensions and enlargements of his subject in all directions. For what still remains is always waiting to engage us in fuller force than what we have already learned; so that the man who is supposed to have reached the very end of knowledge, is considered in the
judgement of another to have come half way; while if Truth give her verdict, he is pronounced to be just beginning.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="10"><p> For “life is short,” said one, “and art

is long”<ref target="5-299-b"/> ; and he best apprehends its greatness



<pb n="301"/>

who honestly sounds its depths, and digs it like a well. So there is a story that a grey-haired
man of great age shed tears when dying, not in any cowardly fear of death, but by reason of his yearning for education, and the thought that he is now first entering upon it, when he takes his final leave of it.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="11"><p> For the soul is just blossoming into knowledge,

when the body’s bloom is <hi rend="italic">withering away</hi> through the passing of years. So it is a hard fate to be tripped up by the heels before one has attained the prime of youthful strength to apprehend things more accurately.
This experience is common to all who love to learn, who see new results of thought and study rise like a shining light in addition to the old. Many of these does the soul, if it be not cursed with barrenness,
bring forth; many does Nature of herself shew to those whose understanding is sharp-sighted, without
giving any sign beforehand of their coming.
<milestone unit="para"/>So then the well of knowledge, the well without limit or ending, has been shewn to be such as I have described.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="12"><p> Why it was named “Oath” I must now

tell you. Matters that are in doubt are decided by an oath, insecure things made secure, assurance given to that which lacked it. From this we conclude that there is nothing which can be asserted with<ref target="5-301-a"/>  greater certainty than that wisdom is essentially without end or limit.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="13"><p> While then it is well to agree with one who

discourses on these truths even if he takes no oath, let anyone who is not very prone to assent do so when the speaker is on his oath. And no one need shrink from taking such an oath, for he may rest assured that


<pb n="303"/>

his name will appear on the register of those who have sworn truly.<ref target="5-303-a"/> 
<milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="3"/> Enough on these points.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="14"><p> The next thing to

inquire is why, when four wells are dug by Abraham and Isaac and those about them (Gen. xxi. 25, xxvi. 19–23), the fourth and last received as its name “Oath.” Probably Moses wishes to shew us
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="15"><p>Allegorically

that while both the constituents of which the universe is composed, and those from which we ourselves were moulded and so fashioned into human shape, are four in number, three of them are such as can in one way or another be apprehended, but the fourth is universally held to be beyond our powers of apprehension.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="16"><p> In the world, then, we find the

constituents that make up the whole to be four, earth, water, air, heaven. To three of these properties have been allotted, the discovery of which may be difficult, but is not wholly impossible.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="17"><p> For, as


regards earth, we perceive that it is a body, heavy, indissoluble, firm, cut up into mountain-ranges and level plains, divided by rivers and sea, so that parts of it are islands, part continents; that some of it has a light thin soil, some of it a deep soil; some of it rough, stiff, stony, and altogether barren, some level and soft and very fertile. These and a thousand other points we apprehend.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="18"><p> As to water


again, we perceive that it has several of the properties just enumerated in common with land, and others peculiar to itself; for some of it is sweet, some brackish, other parts marked by other differences; some water is fit to drink, other water unfit. We know too it has not either of these properties alike for all; one kind of water is drinkable by some but not by others, and what is undrinkable by some is

<pb n="305"/>

quite drinkable by others; and that some is by nature cold, some by nature hot:</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="19"><p> for there are a

thousand springs, in many places giving forth boiling water, and that not only on land, but in the sea. Yes, there have before now appeared veins emitting boiling water in mid ocean, which all the force of the surrounding seas pouring over them from time
immemorial has been powerless to quench or even in any measure to check.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="20"><p> Again we perceive that the

air has a nature which gives way to the pressure of the objects around it; that it is the instrument of life, of breathing, of sight, hearing and the other senses; that it admits of density and rarity, of motion and stillness, that it undergoes all kinds of change; that it is the source of winter and summer, and of the autumn and spring seasons, that is, of the constituent parts that fix the limits of the year’s cycle.
<milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="4"/> All these we perceive;</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="21"><p> but heaven has sent

to us no sure indication of its nature, but keeps it beyond our comprehension.<ref target="5-305-a"/>  For what can we say? That it is a fixed mass of crystal, as some have thought? Or that it is absolutely pure fire? Or that it is a fifth substance, circular in movement, with no part in the four elements? Again, we ask, has the fixed and outmost sphere upward-reaching depth, or is it nothing but a superficies, without depth, resembling plane geometrical figures?</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="22"><p> Again: are

the stars lumps of earth full of fire? Some people


<pb n="307"/>

have declared them to be dells and glades and masses of fiery metal, for which they themselves deserve a prison and mill-house, in which such instruments are kept to punish impiety.<ref target="5-307-a"/>  Or are the stars an unbroken,
and, as one has said, “close” harmony, indissoluble
compresses of ether? Are they living and intelligent, or devoid of intelligence and conscious life? Are their motions determined by choice or simply by necessity?</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="23"><p> Does the moon contribute a

light of its own or a borrowed light caused by the rays of the sun shining on it? Or is it neither the one nor the other by itself absolutely, but the combined
result of both, a mixture such as we might expect from a fire partly its own, partly borrowed?</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="24"><p> Yes, all these and suchlike points pertaining to heaven, that fourth and best cosmic substance, are obscure and beyond our apprehension, based on guess-work and conjecture, not on the solid reasoning of truth; so much so that one may confidently take

one’s oath that the day will never come when any mortal shall be competent to arrive at a clear solution of any of these problems. This is why the fourth and waterless well was named “Oath,” being the endless and altogether baffling quest of the fourth cosmic region, heaven.
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="25"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="5"/> Let us see in what way that which occupies the

fourth place in ourselves too is of such a nature as to be eminently and peculiarly incomprehensible. The factors in us of highest significance are four, body, sense-perception, speech, mind. Three of these are


<pb n="309"/>

not obscure in all their aspects, but contain in
themselves some indications by which they can be
understood. What do I mean?</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="26"><p> We know that the body

is threefold in dimensions and sixfold in movements, having three dimensions, length, depth, breadth, and twice as many, namely six, movements, upward, downward, to the right, to the left, forward, backward.
Nor are we ignorant that it is a vessel for the soul, and we are perfectly aware that it comes to maturity, wears out, grows old, dies, is dissolved.
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="27"><p>With respect to sense-perception, also,

we are not wholly dim-sighted, and blind, but we are able to say that it is divided into five parts, and that each part has its special organs fashioned by Nature, eyes for seeing, ears for hearing, nostrils for smelling, and for the others the organs in which they find their fit place,<ref target="5-309-a"/>  and that they are understanding’s messengers,
bringing to it reports of colours, forms, sounds, distinct scents and savours, in a word, of material substances and their qualities, and that they are bodyguards of the soul, making known all that they have seen or heard. And should any hurtful thing approach from without, they are aware of it beforehand,
and on their guard against it, lest it should stealthily make its way in and cause incurable damage to their mistress.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="28"><p> Sound, too, does not


entirely elude our discernment. We know that one sound is shrill, another deep, one tuneful and melodious,
another discordant and most unmusical, and again, one louder and another softer. They differ also in countless other respects, in genera, tone colours, intervals, conjunct or disjunct systems, and harmonies


<pb n="311"/>

of the fourth, the fifth, the octave.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="29"><p><ref target="5-311-a"/>  In articulate sound, moreover, an advantage possessed

by man alone of all living creatures, there are particulars of which we are aware; as, for example, that it is sent up from the understanding, that it is in the mouth that it acquires articulation, that it is the beat or stroke of the tongue that imparts articulation and speech to the tension of the voice, but does not produce
simply just an idle sound and unshapen noise, since it holds to the suggesting mind the office of its herald and interpreter.
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="30"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="6"/> Is, then, the fourth element in ourselves, the

dominant mind, capable of being comprehended?<ref target="5-311-b"/>  By no means. For what do we suppose it to be essentially? Breath or blood or body in general? Nay, we must pronounce it no body but incorporeal. Do we regard it as boundary-line, or form, or number, or continuity, or harmony, or what amongst all that exists?</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="31"><p> At our birth is it at once introduced into us

from without? Or does the air which envelops it impart intense hardness to the warm nature within us, such as the red-hot iron receives when plunged at the smithy into cold water? The name of “soul” would
seem to have been given to it owing to the “cooling” which it thus undergoes. Again: when we die, is it quenched and does it share the decay of our bodies, or live on for a considerable time, or is it wholly imperishable?</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="32"><p> And where in the body

has the mind made its lair? Has it had a dwelling assigned to it? Some have regarded the head, our body’s citadel, as its hallowed shrine, since it is about



<pb n="313"/>

the head that the senses have their station, and it seems natural to them that they should be posted there, like bodyguards to some mighty monarch. Others contend pertinaciously for their conviction that the heart is the shrine in which it is carried.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="33"><p> So

in every case it is the fourth of the series that is beyond comprehension. In the universe it is the heaven in contrast with the nature of air and earth and water; in man it is mind over against the body, and sense-preception, and the speech which gives expression to thought. It may well be
that it is for this reason that the fourth year is
designated in the sacred documents “holy and for praise<ref target="5-313-a"/> ” (Lev. xix.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="34"><p> 24); for among created things, that which

is holy is, in the universe, the heavens, in which natures imperishable and enduring through long ages have their orbits; in man it is mind, a fragment of the Deity, as the words of Moses in particular bear witness, “He breathed into his face a breath of life, and man became a living soul” (Gen. ii.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="35"><p> 7). And

each of these appears to me to be correctly spoken of as “for praise.” For it is in the heaven and in the mind that capacity resides to set forth in solemn strains hymns of praise and blessing in honour of the Father who is the author of our being. For man is the recipient of a privilege which gives him distinction
beyond other living creatures, that, namely, of worshipping Him that Is;</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="36"><p> while the heaven is ever melodious, producing, as the heavenly bodies go

through their movements, the full and perfect harmony.
If the sound of it ever reached our ears, there would be produced irrepressible yearnings, frantic longings, wild ceaseless passionate desires, compelling to abstain even from necessary food, for no longer

<pb n="315"/>

should we take in nourishment from meat and drink through the throat after the fashion of mortals, but, as beings awaiting immortality, from inspired strains of perfect melody coming to us through our ears. To such strains it is said that Moses was listening, when, having laid aside his body, for forty days and as many nights he touched neither bread nor water at all (Ex. xxiv. 18).
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="37"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="7"/> It seems, then, that the

heaven, the original archetype of all musical instruments,
was tuned with consummate skill for no other purpose than that the hymns sung in honour of the Universal Father may have a musical accompaniment.
And further we hear of Leah or Virtue being no longer capable of bearing children after the birth of her fourth son. She stayed, or rather was stayed, from childbirth, for she found, I imagine, all giving birth on her part dried up and unproductive, when she had put forth the bloom of “Judah,” or Confession of thankfulness, which is the perfect fruit. 
</p></div><div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="38"><p>

To say that she “stood still from bearing” (Gen.

xxix. 35) differs not at all from saying that the servants
of Isaac found no water in the fourth well (Gen. xxvi. 32), since what is brought out by each of the figures is that all things are athirst for God, through Whom the birth of things, and their food when born, is watered into fruitfulness.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="39"><p> It may be


that men of narrow citizenship will suppose that the lawgiver delivers this very full discourse about digging wells, but those who are on the roll of a greater country, even this whole world, men of higher thought and feeling, will be quite sure that the four things propounded as a subject of inquiry to the open-eyed lovers of contemplation are not four wells, but the four parts of this universe, land, water, air, heavens.

<pb n="317"/>

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="40"><p>On each of these they bring to bear powers of

thought of finest perfection, and find in three of them certain things within their comprehension, and to these discoveries of theirs they give three names, “injustice,” “enmity,” “spaciousness”<ref target="5-317-a"/>  (Gen. xxvi. 20 ff.). In the fourth, the heavens, as we pointed out not long ago, they find nothing whatever comprehensible.
For the fourth well is found to be dry and waterless, and is entitled “oath” for the reason which has been mentioned.
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="41"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="8"/> Let us now examine the following context,

and inquire what Haran is and why one who goes away from the well comes to it (Gen. xxviii. 10). Haran is, then, as it seems to me, a sort of mother-city
of the senses. For it is rendered sometimes “dug,” sometimes “holes,” one thing being signified by both words.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="42"><p> For our body has after a fashion

been dug out to make places for the organs of the senses, and each of the organs has been constituted a kind of “dug-out” of each sense, which nature provides
for its lair. Whenever, therefore, a man has put out from the well which is called “Oath,” as it were from a port, of necessity he forthwith arrives<ref target="5-317-b"/>  at Haran. For the man who sets forth on a journey from the place of knowledge, boundless and illimitable
in its vastness, needs no escorting guides, but is without fail received by the senses.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="43"><p> For our

soul moves often by itself, stripping itself of the entire encumbrance of the body and escaping from the noisy pack of the senses, and often again when clad in these wrappings. What is apprehensible



<pb n="319"/>

by intellect only is the lot of its unclad movement, while to that accompanied by the body fall the objects of sense-perception.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="44"><p> If therefore a man is

absolutely incapable of holding intercourse with the understanding by itself, he wins in sense-perception a second-best refuge, and a man who has been balked of the things of the intellect is forthwith swept down to those of sense-perception. For those who have failed to make a good voyage under the sails of the sovereign mind can always fall back upon the oars of sense-perception.<ref target="5-319-a"/>  
</p></div><div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="45"><p>
But it is an excellent


course even when you have fallen into this plight not to grow old and live your life in it, but feeling that you are spending your days in a foreign country as sojourners to be ever seeking for removal and return to the land of your fathers. For it is Laban, a man without knowledge of species or genus or archetypal form, or conception or of any whatever of the objects of solely intellectual apprehension, but dependent wholly on things patent and palpable, which are cognizable by seeing and hearing and the powers akin to them,—he it is that has been deemed worthy of having Haran for his country, in which Jacob the lover of virtue dwells as in a foreign land for a little while, with his mind ever set on the return to his home.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="46"><p> We recognize this in the words spoken to

him by Rebecca, or Patience, his mother: “Be up and off,” she says, “to Haran to my brother Laban, and dwell with him for some days “(Gen. xxvii. 43 f.). Do you mark, then, that the Practiser does not brook to spend a lifetime in the territory of the senses, but a few days and a short time in compliance with the necessities of the body to which he is tied, but that it is in the city discerned by the intellect that a life-long

<pb n="321"/>
enduring is in store for him? |
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="47"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="9"/> Owing


to this, as it seems to me, the grandfather also of his knowledge,<ref target="5-321-a"/>  called Abraham, did not brook a prolonged stay in Haran. For we read “Abraham was seventy-five
years old when he went forth from Haran”
(Gen. xii. 4), although his father lived there until his death. His father’s name was “Terah,” which means “scent-exploring.”</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="48"><p> Thus it is expressed in plain

words in the sacred records that “Terah died in Haran” (Gen. xi. 32): for he was there as a spy or explorer of virtue, not as a holder of its franchise, and he had recourse to scents, not to enjoyment of nourishing
foods, not being capable as yet of being filled with sound sense, nay, not even of tasting it, but simply and solely of smelling it.</p></div>

hounds used in the chase have by nature the sense of smell especially keen, so that by following the scent they can track out and find the dead bodies of wild animals at the greatest distance, in the same way does the man who is enamoured of discipline follow the path of the sweet effluvium given forth by justice and other virtues. Fain would he reach them, so wondrously delicious is the fragrance they give forth, but since he cannot, he turns his baffled<ref target="5-321-b"/>  head this way and that, and snuffs, for he can do no more, at the exhalation of nobility, the holiest of meats<ref target="5-321-c"/> : for he does not deny that he is greedy of knowledge and sound sense.</p></div>

that Terah left the land of Chaldaea and migrated to Haran, taking with him his son Abraham and his kindred, is given us not with the object that we may learn as from a writer of history, that certain people became emigrants, leaving the land of their ancestors, and making a foreign land their home and country, but that a lesson well suited to man and of great service to human life may not be neglected.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="53"><p> What

is this lesson? The Chaldaeans are astronomers, while the citizens of Haran busy themselves with the place<ref target="5-323-a"/>  of the senses. Accordingly Holy Writ addresses to the explorer of the facts of nature certain
questions—“Why do you carry on investigations about the sun, as to whether it is a foot in diameter,<ref target="5-323-b"/>  whether it is larger than the whole earth, whether it is many times its size<ref target="5-323-b"/> ? And about the illuminations of the moon, whether it has a borrowed light, or whether it employs one entirely its own? And why do you search into the nature of the other heavenly bodies, or into their revolutions or the ways in which they affect each other and affect earthly things?</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="54"><p> And

why, treading as you do on earth, do you leap over the clouds? And why do you say that you are able to lay hold of what is in the upper air, when

<pb n="325"/>

you are rooted to the ground? Why do you venture to determine the indeterminate? And why are you so busy with what you ought to leave alone, the things above? And why do you extend even to the heavens your learned ingenuity? Why do you take up astronomy and pay such full and minute attention to the higher regions? Mark, my friend, not what is above and beyond your reach but what is close to yourself,<ref target="5-325-a"/>  or rather make yourself the object of your impartial scrutiny.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="55"><p> What form, then, will


your scrutiny take? Go in spirit to Haran, ‘excavated’
land, the openings and cavities of the body, and hold an inspection of eyes, ears, nostrils, and the other organs of sense, and engage in a course of philosophy most vital and most fitting to a human being. Try to find out what sight is, what hearing is, what taste, smell, touch are: in a word what
sense-perception is. Next, ask what it is to see and how you see, what it is to hear and how you hear, what it is to smell or taste or handle, and how each function is habitually performed.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="56"><p> But before you have made

a thorough investigation into your own tenement, is it not an excess of madness to examine that of the universe? And there is a weightier charge which I do not as yet lay upon you,<ref target="5-325-b"/>  namely to see your own soul and the mind of which you think so proudly: I say ‘see,’ for to comprehend it you will never be able. Go to!</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="58"><p> This character Hebrews call “Terah,”

Greeks “Socrates.” For they say that “Know thyself” was likewise the theme of lifelong pondering
to Socrates, and that his philosophy was concerned exclusively with his own self. Socrates, however, was a human being, while Terah was
self-knowledge itself, a way of thinking set before us as a tree of great luxuriance, to the end that lovers of virtue might find it easy, as they pluck the fruit of moral knowledge, to take their fill of nourishment saving and most sweet.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="59"><p> Such do we find


those to be whose part it is to explore good sense: but more perfect than theirs is the nature with which those are endowed who train themselves to engage in the contest for it. These, when they have thoroughly learned in all its details the whole study of the sense-perceptions, claim it as their prerogative to
advance to some other greater object of
contemplation, leaving behind them those
lurking-places of sense-perception, to which the name of Haran is given.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="60"><p> Among these

is Abraham who gained much progress and improvement towards the acquisition of the highest knowledge:
for when most he knew himself, then most did he despair<ref target="5-327-b"/>  of himself, in order that he might attain to an exact knowledge of Him Who in reality is. And this is nature’s law: he who has thoroughly comprehended himself, thoroughly despairs of himself


<pb n="329"/>

having as a step to this ascertained the nothingness in all respects of created being.
And the man who has despaired of himself is
beginning to know Him that is.
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="61"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="11"/> What Haran is and why the man who leaves

the Well of the Oath comes to it, has been made evident. We must consider the point which naturally comes next, our third point, namely what the place is which he lights upon or meets, for we read “he met a place” (Gen. xxviii.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="62"><p> 11). Now “place” has a

threefold meaning, firstly that of a space filled by a material form, secondly that of the Divine Word, which God Himself has completely filled throughout with incorporeal potencies; for “they saw,” says Moses, “the place where the God of Israel stood” (Ex. xxiv.10).<ref target="5-329-a"/>  only in this place did he permit them to sacrifice, forbidding them to do so elsewhere: for they were expressly bidden to go up “to the place which the Lord God shall choose” (Deut. xii. 5), and there to sacrifice “the whole burnt offerings and the peace offerings” (Ex. xx. 24) and to offer the other pure sacrifices.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="63"><p> There is a third


signification, in keeping with which God Himself is called a place, by reason of His containing things, and being contained by nothing whatever, and being a place for all to flee into, and because He is Himself the space which holds Him; for He is that which He Himself has occupied, and naught encloses Him but Himself.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="64"><p> I, mark you, am not a place, but in a place;

and each thing likewise that exists; for that which is contained is different from that which contains it, and the Deity, being contained by nothing, is of necessity Itself Its own place. Witness is borne to
what I am saying by this oracle delivered in Abraham’s

<pb n="331"/>

case: “He came to the place of which God had told him: and lifting up his eyes he saw the place from afar” (Gen. xxii.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="65"><p> 3 f.).<ref target="5-331-a"/>  Tell me, pray, did he who

had come to the place see it from afar? Nay, it would seem that one and the same word is used of two different things: one of these is a divine Word, the other God Who was before the Word.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="66"><p> One who has

come from abroad under Wisdom’s guidance arrives at the former place, thus attaining in the divine word the sum and consummation of service. But when he has his place in the divine Word he does not actually reach Him Who is in very essence God, but sees Him from afar: or rather, not even from a distance is he capable of contemplating Him; all he sees is the bare fact that God is far away from all Creation, and that the apprehension of Him is removed to a very great distance from all human power of thought.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="67"><p> Nay, it may be that neither in this part of the text<ref target="5-331-b"/> 

does the lawgiver use “place” as a figurative
description of the First Cause, but that what is signified is something like this: “he came to the place and looked up and saw with his eyes” the place itself to which he had come, that it was a long way off from God for Whom no name nor utterance nor conception of any sort is adequate.
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="68"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="12"/> Having laid down these preliminary definitions,


we resume our story. When the Practiser comes to Haran, or Sense-perception, he “meets a place.” This “place” is not that filled by a mortal body, for of that all earth-born men have their share, for they have filled a space and occupy of necessity some place. Nor is it that best one, the third named above, of which it would hardly have been possible for him to form a conception by dwelling at the well

<pb n="333"/>

called “Oath” where Isaac has his abode, the self-taught
nature that never desists from faith toward God and dim conception of Him.<ref target="5-333-a"/>  No: the “place” on which he “lights” is the place in the middle sense, the Word of God, shewing, as it does, the way to the things that are best, teaching, as it does, such lessons as the varying occasions require.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="69"><p> For

God, not deeming it meet that sense should perceive Him, sends forth His Words to succour the lovers of virtue, and they act as physicians of the soul and completely heal its infirmities, giving holy exhortations with all the force of irreversible enactments, and calling to the exercise and practice of these and like trainers implanting strength and power and vigour that no adversary can withstand.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="70"><p> Meet and right then is it that Jacob, having come

to Sense-perception, meets not now God but a word of God, even as did Abraham, the grandfather of his wisdom.<ref target="5-333-b"/>  For we are told that “the Lord departed, when He ceased speaking to Abraham, and Abraham returned to his place” (Gen. xviii. 33). By “returning to his place” is implied the meeting with sacred Words of a kind from which the God Who is prior to all things has withdrawn, ceasing to extend visions! that proceed from Himself, but only those that proceed from the potencies inferior to Him.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="71"><p> | There is an extraordinary fitness in saying not that

he came to the place, but that he met with a place; for coming is a matter of choice, but there is often no exercise of choice in meeting. Thus should the divine Word, by manifesting Itself suddenly and offering Itself as a fellow-traveller to a lonely soul, hold out to it an unlooked-for joy—which is greater


<pb n="335"/>

than hope.<ref target="5-335-a"/>  For Moses too, when he “leads out the people to meet God” (Ex. xix. 17), knows full well that He comes all unseen to the souls that yearn to come into His presence.
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="72"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="13"/> The lawgiver further states the reason why

Jacob “met” a place: “for the sun was set,” it says (Gen. xxviii. 11), not this sun which shews itself to our eyes, but the light of the supreme and invisible God most brilliant and most radiant. When this shines upon the understanding, it causes those lesser luminaries of words<ref target="5-335-b"/>  to set, and in a far higher degree casts into shade all the places of sense-perception; but when it has gone elsewhither, all these at once have their dawn and rising.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="73"><p> And marvel not if the

sun, in accordance with the rules of allegory, is likened to the Father and Ruler of the universe: for although in reality nothing is like God, there have been accounted so in human opinion two things only, one invisible, one visible, the soul invisible, the sun visible.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="74"><p> The soul’s likeness to God the lawgiver has

shewn elsewhere, by saying “God made man, after the image of God made He him” (Gen. i. 27),<ref target="5-335-c"/>  and again, in the law enacted against murderers, “he that sheddeth man’s blood, in requital for his blood shall there blood be shed, because in the image of God made I man “(Gen. ix. 6); while the sun’s likeness
to God he has indicated by figures.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="75"><p> In other ways also it is easy to discern this by a

process of reasoning.<ref target="5-335-d"/>  In the first place: God is



<pb n="337"/>

light, for there is a verse in one of the psalms, “the Lord is my illumination and my Saviour “(Ps. xxvii. [xxvi.] 1). And He is not only light, but the archetype
of every other light, nay, prior to and high above every archetype, holding the position of the model of a model. For the model or pattern was the Word which contained all His fullness—light, in fact<ref target="5-337-a"/> ; for, as the lawgiver tells us, “God said, ‘let light come into being’” (Gen. i. 3), whereas He Himself resembles none of the things which have come into being.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="76"><p> Secondly: as the sun makes day


and night distinct, so Moses says that God kept apart light and darkness; for “God,” he tells us, “separated
between the light and between the darkness” (Gen. i. 4).
And above all, as the sun when it rises makes visible objects which had been hidden, so God when He gave birth to all things, not only brought them into sight, but also made things which before were not, not just handling material as an artificer, but being Himself its creator.
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="77"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="14"/> In the course of sacred revelation “Sun” is

used in several figurative senses. To begin with, it is used of the human mind, which is erected and set up as a city by those who under compulsion serve creation in preference to the uncreated One. Of them we read that “they built strong cities for Pharaoh, namely Peitho,” speech, to which persuading is dedicated, “and Raamses,” sense-perception, by


<pb n="339"/>

which the soul is eaten through as though by moths: the name means “moth-shock”;—“and On,” the mind, which Moses called Sun-city (Ex. i. 11), since the mind, like a sun, has assumed the leadership of our entire frame and bulk, and makes its forces reach, like the sun’s rays, to every part of it.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="78"><p> And everyone

who has accepted the citizenship of the body, and the name of such is Joseph, chooses for his father-in-law the priest and devotee of Mind.<ref target="5-339-a"/>  For Moses says that Pharaoh “gave him Asenath, daughter of Potiphera,
priest of Heliopolis” (Gen. xli.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="79"><p> 45). Secondly, Moses uses “sun” figuratively for sense-perception,


inasmuch as it shews all objects of sense to the understanding. It is of sense-perception that Moses has spoken on this wise: “the sun arose upon him when he passed by the appearance of God”
(Gen. xxxii. 31); for in truth, when we are no longer able to remain in company with holiest forms, which are as it were incorporeal images, but turn in a different direction and go elsewhere, we are led by another light, even that which answers to sense-perception,
a light, as compared with sound reason, differing no whit from darkness.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="80"><p> When this sun has

risen it wakes up sight and hearing, yea taste and smell and touch, from their seeming sleep, but sound sense and justice and knowledge and wisdom, which it finds awake, it plunges in sleep.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="81"><p> This is why the

sacred word says that no one can be clean until the even (Lev. xi. <hi rend="italic">passim</hi>), the understanding being till then at the mercy of the movements of sense-perception.
For the priests too he lays down an inexorable law, in the form of a prediction,<ref target="5-339-b"/>  in the


<pb n="341"/>

words: “He will not eat of the holy things unless he have washed his body with water, and the sun be set, and he have become clean” (Lev. xxii.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="82"><p> 6 f.). For he

makes it perfectly evident by this declaration that no one is absolutely free from pollution, so as to celebrate the holy and reverend mysteries, by whom the splendours of this mortal life, objects as they are of sense-perception, are still held in honour. But if a man disdains them, the consequence is that he is shone upon by the light of sound sense, and by means of it he will be able completely to purge and wash out of himself the defilements of vain opinions.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="83"><p> Or look

at the sun itself. Do you not see that the effect of its rising is the reverse of that of its setting? When it has risen, all things on earth are lit up, while those in the heavens are obscured: on the contrary, when it has set the stars appear, and earthly objects are hidden. It is precisely the same with us.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="84"><p> When the

light of our senses has risen like a sun, the various forms of knowledge, so truly heavenly and celestial, disappear from sight: when it reaches its setting, radiances most divine and most star-like sent forth from virtues come into view: and it is then that the mind also becomes pure because it is darkened by no object of sense.
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="85"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="15"/> The third meaning


in which he employs the title sun is that of the divine Word, the pattern, as has been already mentioned, of the sun which makes its circuit in the sky. It is of the divine Word that it is said, “The sun went forth upon the earth, and Lot entered into Zoar, and the Lord rained on Sodom and Gomorrah brimstone and fire” (Gen. xix.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="86"><p> 23 f.). For the Word of God, when

it arrives at our earthy composition, in the case of

<pb n="343"/>

those who are akin to virtue and turn away<ref target="5-343-a"/>  to her, gives help and succour, thus affording them a refuge and perfect safety, but sends upon her adversaries irreparable ruin.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="87"><p> In a fourth sense, as I


have already said, the title of “Sun” is applied to the Ruler of the Universe Himself, through Whose agency irremediable sins, when apparently concealed, are disclosed. For to God all things are known, even as all things are possible.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="88"><p> In accordance


with this we see Him bringing to the sun to be laid bare those energies of the soul that have been unstrung
by lewd and licentious intercourse with Mind’s daughters, the senses, as though they were common strumpets.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="89"><p> For he says “and the people abode in

Shittim”—the meaning of this name is “thorns,”<ref target="5-343-a"/>  symbol of passions pricking and wounding the soul—“and
was defiled to commit whoredom with the daughters of Moab”—these are the senses, entitled daughters of Mind; for the translation of “Moab”
is “from a father.” The lawgiver adds the command given him: “Take all the chiefs of the people and set them up publicly<ref target="5-343-b"/>  unto the Lord before the sun, and the anger of the Lord shall be turned away from Israel” (Num. xxv.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="90"><p> 1, 4). It was not only that, in

his desire that the hidden deeds of unrighteousness should be made manifest, he caused the rays of the sun to shine about them. More than this, he gave the figurative title of “Sun” to the universal Father, to Whose sight all things are open, even those which are perpetrated invisibly in the recesses of the
understanding. He says that when they have been made manifest, the One gracious Being will be found


<pb n="345"/>

gracious. Why so? Because, if the understanding.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="91"><p>

imagining that its wrongdoing will escape the notice of God as though He were not able to see all things, sin secretly in deep recesses; if subsequently, whether of itself or by the leading of another, it come to realize that it is impossible that anything should be otherwise than clear to God; if it unfold itself and all its doings, and bringing them out into the open expose them as it were in the sunlight to Him Whose eye is upon all things; if it say that it repents of the evil opinions which it formerly held in reliance upon an ill-judging judgement; if it acknowledge that nothing is withdrawn from His sight, but that all things are ever known and manifest to Him, not only those which have been done already, but the far greater body of those which are but contemplated in the future;—then has it gained cleansing and benefit and has appeased the just wrath of the convicting wielder of the lash who was standing over it. So is it with the soul if it embraces repentance, younger brother of complete guiltlessness.
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="92"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="16"/> There are other cases in which the lawgiver

evidently takes the sun figuratively as applying to the First Cause, as in the Law enacted with reference to those who lend money on security. Read the Law: “If thou take thy neighbour’s garment to pledge thou shalt restore it to him before the setting of the sun; for this is his only covering, it is the garment of his shame. Wherein shall he sleep? If then he cry unto Me, I will hear him, for I am compassionate” (Ex. xxii.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="93"><p> 26 f.). Do not those who suppose that the lawgiver feels

all this concern about a cloak deserve, if not reproach,

<pb n="347"/>

at least a reminder, in such terms as, “What are you saying, good sirs? Does the Creator and Ruler of the universe speak of Himself as compassionate in regard to so trifling a matter, a garment not returned to a debtor by a lender of money? To entertain such ideas is a mark of men who have utterly failed to see the greatness of the excellence of the infinitely great God, and against every principle human or divine attribute human pettiness to the Being Who is un-originate
and incorruptible and full of all blessedness

and happiness. 
</p></div><div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="95"><p>
What is there outrageous in moneylenders keeping the securities in their own hands, until they have got back their own? Someone will say perhaps that the debtors are poor men, and deserve pity. In that case would it not be better to make a law for contributing to the needs of such people instead of making them debtors, or for prohibiting lending upon security?</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="96"><p> But the legislator who has permitted this cannot reasonably be indignant with those who do not give up before the time what they have received, and treat them as devoid of

piety.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="97"><p> And does a man who has reached practically the extreme limit of poverty, and is clothed with a single rag, endeavour to attract fresh money-lenders, while he lets pass unheeded the compassion, which goes forth abundantly from all beholders, indoors, at temples, in the market-place, everywhere, to those

who experience such misfortunes? But in this case he is supposed to bring and offer the sole covering of his shame, with which he veiled nature’s secret parts. And security for <hi rend="italic">what?</hi> tell me that. Is it for a better garment to take its place? For no one is at



<pb n="349"/>

a loss for the bare necessities of food, so long as springs gush forth, and rivers run down in winter, and earth yields her fruits in their season.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="98"><p> And is the creditor

either so swallowed up in riches or so exceedingly cruel as to be unwilling to afford a tetradrachm (or less it maybe) to anybody, or make a loan rather than a free gift to one so poor, or to take as security the man’s only garment, an act which might well be given another name and called coat-snatching? For that is the coat-snatcher’s way; when they remove people’s apparel they carry it off, and leave the owners naked.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="99"><p> And why did he take


thought for night and that no one should sleep without clothing,<ref target="5-349-a"/>  but shewed no such care for the day and that a man should not be indecent in his waking hours? Or is it not the case that by night and darkness all things are hidden, so that nakedness causes less shame or none at all, whereas by the light of day all things are uncovered, so that then one is more obliged to blush?</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="100"><p> And why did he


enjoin not the <hi rend="italic">giving</hi> but the <hi rend="italic">returning</hi> of the garment? For we <hi rend="italic">return</hi> what belongs to another, whereas the securities belong to the lenders rather than to the borrowers. And do you not notice that he has given no direction to the debtor, after taking the garment to use as a blanket, when day has come to get up and remove it and carry it to the money-lender?</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="101"><p> And indeed the peculiarities of the wording might

well lead even the slowest-witted reader to perceive the presence of something other than the literal meaning of the passage: for the ordinance bears the


<pb n="351"/>

marks of an explanatory statement rather than of an exhortation. A man giving an exhortation would have said, “If the garment given as security be the only one the borrower has, return it before evening, that he may have it to wrap round him at night.”
But if he makes a statement<ref target="5-351-a"/>  he would put as it stands:
“thou shalt give it back to him, for this is the only wrapper he has, this is the garment without which he is not decent; what is he to sleep in? “(Ex. xxii. 27).
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="102"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="17"/> Let what has been said and other considerations

of the same kind suffice for the self-satisfied pedantic professors of literalism, and let us in accordance with the rules of allegory make such remarks on this passage as are appropriate. Well, then, we say that a garment is a figure for rational speech.<ref target="5-351-b"/>  For clothing keeps off the mischiefs that are wont to befall the body from frost and heat; it conceals nature’s secret parts; and the raiment is a fitting adornment to the person.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="103"><p> In like manner, rational

speech was bestowed on man by God as the best of gifts. First of all, it is a weapon of defence against those who threaten him with violence. For as nature has fortified other living creatures each with appropriate means of guarding themselves whereby they may beat off those who attempt to do them an injury, so has she given to man a most strong redoubt and impregnable fort in rational speech. Grasping this with all his might as a soldier does his weapons, he will have a body-guard meeting his every need. Having this to fight before him, he will be able to ward off the hurts which his enemies would fain


<pb n="353"/>

inflict upon him.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="104"><p> In the second place, rational speech

is a most necessary covering for matters of shame and reproach; it has great ability to conceal and hide up men’s sins. Thirdly, it serves as an adornment of the whole life: for this it is that makes each one of us better and leads every man to something higher.
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="105"><p>But there are some men who—mischievous

pests that they are<ref target="5-353-a"/> —actually hold rational speech in pawn, and rob its possessors of it, and, when they ought to foster its growth, cut it utterly down, like those who ravage the fields of their enemies and endeavour to destroy both the wheat and the other crops, which if left alone would have been a great boon to the consumers.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="106"><p> What I mean is that there

What is this

save reason? For as neighing is peculiar to a horse, and barking to a dog, and lowing to a cow, and roaring to a lion, so is speech and reason itself to man.

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="110"><p> For ignorance, the kin of the irrational nature, is a matter of shame, while culture, near akin to reason, is his proper adornment: “In

what, then, shall he sleep?” or, in other words, wherein shall a man find calmness and complete repose, save in reason? For reason brings relief to those of us whose fate is the most grievous. Even, then, as the kindliness and companionship and courtesy of friends has many a time healed and comforted those who were oppressed by sorrows or fears or some other ills, so not often but always is it mischief-averting reason that alone dislodges the overwhelming burden laid upon us by the distresses incident to our yokefellow the body, or by the unforeseen disasters that swoop down on us from without.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="111"><p> For reason is our friend,

familiar, associate, comrade, bound up with us, or rather cemented and united with us by an invisible and indissoluble natural glue. That is why it both foretells what will be expedient, and, when something undesirable has occurred, is at hand with unsolicited

aid, bringing not only one or other of the two kinds of help, that of the adviser who does not act, or that of the fellow-combatant who does not speak, but both of these.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="112"><p> For the power which reason exercises does

not work by half measures, but is thoroughgoing on every side, and if it fails in its plans or in its execution of them, it has recourse to the third mode of help-giving, namely consolation.<ref target="5-357-a"/>  For as there are healing applications for wounds, so are the disorders of the soul healed by reason, of which the lawgiver says that it must be restored “before the setting of the sun” (Ex4. xxii. 26), which means before the going down of those all-illuminating rays of the God who is greatest and most present to help, who by reason of His compassion for our race sends them forth from heaven into the mind of man.</p></div>

In the time of fruitfulness and uplifting, there shine upon it the archetypal and incorporeal rays of the fountain of reason, God the consummator, but when it sinks low and fails to yield, its light is the images of these rays, immortal “words” which it is customary to call angels.</p></div>

For we read in Exodus (x. 23), “For the children of Israel there was light in all their dwellings,” so that night and darkness are for ever banished, with which they live whose blindness is not of the body, but of the soul, who know not

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="118"><p> Some, supposing that in


this passage “sun” is a figurative expression for sense and mind, our own accepted standards of judgement, and “place” for the divine word, have understood the passage in this way: “the Practiser met a divine word when the mortal and human light had gone down.”</p></div>

Into it they convey an unlimited supply of eatables one after another, and steep it in quantities of strong drink, until the reasoning faculty is drowned, and the sensual<ref target="5-363-a"/>  passions born of excess are aroused and raging with a fury that brooks no check, after falling upon and entangling themselves with all whom they meet, have disgorged their great frenzy and have abated.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="128"><p> Of these words

he takes one, choosing as the best the topmost one,

occupying the place which the head does in the whole<ref target="5-367-a"/>  body, and sets it up close to his understanding (Gen. xxviii. 11); for the understanding is, we may say, the soul’s head. He does so professedly<ref target="5-367-b"/>  to sleep upon it, but in reality to repose on the divine word, and lay his whole life, lightest of burdens, thereon.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="129"><p> The

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="130"><p>It is then too that he confers on him the

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="133"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="22"/> Such, then, is the prelude of the God-sent

vision, and it is now time to turn to the vision itself, and to examine in detail its several points. “He dreamed,” it runs, “and behold a stairway set up on the earth, and the top of it reached to heaven: and the angels of God were ascending and descending on it; and the Lord stood firmly upon it” (Gen. xxviii.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="134"><p> 12). “Stairway” when applied to the universe is a

figurative name for the air; whose foot is earth and its head heaven. For the air extends in all directions to the ends of the earth from the sphere of the moon which is described by meteorologists as last of the heavenly zones, and first of those which are related to us.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="135"><p><ref target="5-369-a"/>  The air is the abode of incorporeal souls, since

it seemed good to their Maker to fill all parts of the universe with living beings. He set land-animals on the earth, aquatic creatures in the seas and rivers, and in heaven the stars, each of which is said to be not a living creature only but mind of the purest kind





<pb n="371"/>

through and through; and therefore in air also, the remaining section of the universe, living creatures exist. If they are not to be apprehended by sense, what of that? The soul too is a thing invisible.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="136"><p>

Indeed it is more to be expected that air should be the nurse of living creatures than that land and water should, seeing that it is air that has given vitality to the creatures of land and water, for the Great Artificer made air the principle of coherence in motionless bodies, the principle of growth in bodies which move but receive no sense-impressions, while in bodies that are susceptible of impulse and sense-impression He made it the principle of life.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="137"><p> Is it not then inconsistent

that the element through which other things obtained vitality should be empty of living souls? Accordingly let no one take away nature at its best, as it is in living creatures, from the best of earth’s elements, air: for so far is air from being alone of all things untenanted, that like a city it has a goodly population, its citizens being imperishable and immortal souls equal in number to the stars.
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="138"><p>Of these souls some, such as have earthward tendencies

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="139"><p> Of these last


some, longing for the familiar and accustomed ways of mortal life, again retrace their steps, while others pronouncing that life great foolery call the body a prison and a tomb, and escaping as though from a dungeon or a grave, are lifted up on light wings to the upper air and range the heights for ever.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="140"><p> Others



<pb n="373"/>

there are of perfect purity and excellence, gifted with a higher and diviner temper, that have never felt any craving after the things of earth, but are viceroys of the Ruler of the universe, ears and eyes, so to speak, of the great king,<ref target="5-373-a"/>  beholding and hearing all things.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="141"><p> These are called “demons” by the other philosophers,

but the sacred record is wont to call them
“angels” or messengers, employing an apter title, for they both convey the biddings of the Father to His children and report the children’s need to their Father.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="142"><p><ref target="5-373-b"/>  In accordance with this they are represented

by the lawgiver as ascending and descending: not that God, who is already present in all directions, needs informants, but that it was a boon to us in our sad case to avail ourselves of the services of “words”
acting on our behalf as mediators, so great is our awe and shuddering dread of the universal Monarch and the exceeding might of His sovereignty.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="143"><p> It was our

attainment of a conception of this that once made us address to one of those mediators the entreaty:
“Speak thou to us, and let not God speak to us, lest haply we die” (Ex. xx. 19). For should He, without employing ministers, hold out to us with His own hand, I do not say chastisements, but even benefits unmixed and exceeding great, we are incapable of receiving them.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="144"><p> It is a fine thought that


the dreamer sees the air symbolized by a stairway as firmly set on the earth; for the exhalations given forth out of the earth are rarefied and so turned into air, so that earth is air’s foot and root and heaven its head.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="145"><p> Do they not tell us that the moon is not an unmixed

extent are moving incessantly the “words” of God, drawing it up with them when they ascend and disconnecting it with what is mortal, and exhibiting to it the spectacle of the only objects worthy of our gaze; and when they descend not casting it down, for neither does God nor does a divine Word cause harm, but condescending out of love for man and compassion for our race, to be helpers and comrades, that with the healing of their breath they may quicken into new life the soul which is still borne along in the body as in a river.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="148"><p><ref target="5-375-b"/>  In the understandings of those who have

been purified to the utmost the Ruler of the universe walks noiselessly, alone, invisibly, for verily there is an oracle once vouchsafed to the Sage, in which it is said: “I will walk in you, and will be your God”
(Lev. xxvi. 12): but in the understandings of those who are still undergoing cleansing and have not yet fully washed their life defiled and stained by the body’s weight there walk angels, divine words, making them bright and clean with the doctrines of all that is good and beautiful.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="150"><p><milestone unit="para"/>It may be too that the Practiser has his own life

presented to him in his vision as resembling a stairway; for practising is by nature an uneven business, at one moment going onward to a height, at another returning in the opposite direction, and at one time like a ship making life’s voyage with fair winds, at another with ill winds. For the life of practisers is, as one has said, a life “of alternate days,”<ref target="5-377-a"/>  sometimes alive and wakeful, sometimes dead or asleep.</p></div>

extremes—are often stepping up and down as upon a stairway, either being drawn upwards by the better portion or dragged in the opposite direction by the worse, until God, the umpire of this strife and conflict, bestows the prizes on the better order, and brings its opposite to perdition.

that stands upon the stairway of heaven says to him who beholds the dream-vision, “I am the Lord God of Abraham thy father and the God of Isaac: fear not” (Gen. xxviii. 13).

It clearly taught him that He Who is Lord and God of the universe is both Lord and God of his family, registered under both titles as held by father and grandfather, to the end that the world at large and the lover of virtue may have the same inheritance: for it has been said, “the Lord Himself is his inheritance”<ref target="5-381-a"/>  (Deut. x. 9).

It seems to me that it was by discerning this that the Practiser was led to pray a prayer worthy of the utmost admiration, that the Lord would become to him God (Gen. xxviii. 21): for he wished no longer to be in dread of Him as ruler, but lovingly to honour Him as bestower of kindness.</p></div>

The lawgiver says that virtue is gained either by nature or by practice or by learning, and has accordingly recorded the patriarchs of the nation as three in number, all wise men.<ref target="5-385-a"/>  They had not at the start the same form of character, but they were all bent on reaching the same goal.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="168"><p> Abraham,

the earliest of them, had teaching as his guide on the way that leads to the good and beautiful, as we shall shew to the best of our ability in another treatise. Isaac who comes between him and Jacob had as his guide a nature which listens to and learns from itself alone. Jacob, the third of them, relied on exercises and practisings preparatory for the strenuous toil of the arena.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="169"><p> There being, then, three



<pb n="387"/>

methods by which virtue accrues, it is the first and third that are most intimately connected; for what comes by practice is the offspring and product of that which comes by learning; whereas that which comes by nature is, to be sure, of kin with them, being like a root at the bottom of all three, but the prerogative allotted to it is one which none contests and which needs no effort.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="170"><p> Thus it is quite natural to say that

Abraham, who owed his improvement to teaching, was father of Jacob, who was shaped and drilled by exercises, meaning not so much that the man Abraham was father of the man Jacob, as that the faculty of hearing which is a most ready instrument for learning begets and produces the faculty of exercise and practice so serviceable in contest.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="171"><p> If,


however, our practiser exert himself and run to the end of the course, and come to see clearly what he formerly saw dimly as in a dream, and receives the impress of a nobler character and the name of
“Israel,” “he that seeth God,” in place of “Jacob,”
“the supplanter,” he no longer claims as his father Abraham, the man who learned, but Isaac the man who was born good by nature.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="172"><p> This is not a story

invented by me, but an oracle inscribed upon the sacred tables. For we read that “Israel took his journey with all that he had, and came to the well of the oath, and offered a sacrifice to the God of his father Isaac” (Gen. xlvi. 1). Do you by this time perceive that the discourse before us is not about mortal men, but, as already stated, about the facts of nature? For you observe that the same subject is at one time named Jacob, with Abraham as his

<pb n="389"/>

father, and at another is styled Israel with Isaac as his father, the reason for this being that which has been set forth in detail.
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="173"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="28"/> So, after saying “I am the Lord God of

Abraham thy father and the God of Isaac,”
he adds “fear not” (Gen. xxviii. 13). The words come naturally after the others; for how shall we any longer be afraid, when we have Thee our Defender, a weapon that brings deliverance from fear and every passion? Moreover, it was Thou that didst bring out of obscurity into distinctness the original patterns of our education, Abraham whose teacher, and Isaac whose parent<ref target="5-389-a"/>  Thou wast: for Thou didst condescend to be named instructor of the one and father of the other, giving one the position of pupil, the other that of son.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="174"><p> It is because Thou art this that Thou dost

promise that Thou wilt give him the land also, virtue I mean abounding in all manner of fruits, whereon the Practiser slumbers, asleep to the life of sense, but awake to that of the soul and therefore at rest. Thou graciously approvest his peaceful repose, which he won not without war and war’s hardships, a war in which he bore no arms and destroyed no men (away with the thought!) but overthrew the troop of passions and vices that oppose virtue.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="175"><p> Wisdom’s race

is likened to the sand of the earth (<hi rend="italic">ibid</hi>. 14), both because its number is without limit and because the sand-bank forces back the inroads of the sea, as those of sinful and unjust deeds are kept back by trained reason. And this, in accordance with the Divine promises, is broadening out to the very bounds of the universe, and renders its possessor inheritor of the four quarters of the world, reaching to them all, to East, and West, and South and North: for it is said, “It

<pb n="391"/>

shall spread abroad, to the West and to the South and to the North and to the East?</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="176"><p> “(<hi rend="italic">ibid</hi>. 14). The

man of worth is not just a good to himself but a common good to all men. From his ready store he proffers the boon which is his to give. For as the sun is a light to all who have eyes, so is the wise man to such as are partakers of a rational nature,
<milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="29"/> for he says “in thee shall all tribes be blessed” (<hi rend="italic">ibid</hi>. 14).
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="177"><p>Now this divine utterance has its application

to a man both in his relation to his own separate being, and as a social being related to others. For if the mind which is in me have been rendered pure by perfect virtue, then the “tribes” of that which is earthly in me are sharers of its purifying, those I mean which pertain to the senses and to that chiefest container, the body. Again, if one belonging to a household or city or country or nation become a lover of sound sense, it must be that that household and city and country and nation has a better mode of life.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="178"><p> For just as the exhalations from aromatic herbs fill

those who come near them with a sweet fragrance, in the same way those who belong to the circle and neighbourhood of a wise man, drinking in the atmosphere which spreads far and wide around him, are improved in character.
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="179"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="30"/> It is a vast boon to a toiling and striving soul

to have as a Fellow-traveller God whose presence reaches everywhere: for we read, “Behold, I am with thee” (<hi rend="italic">ibid</hi>. 15). Of what riches can we any longer stand in need, when we have Thee Who art alone the true riches, “keeping us on the way”
which leads to virtue, along all its sections?<ref target="5-391-a"/>  For there is not one part only of the life according to reason which tends to righteousness and virtue generally,

<pb n="393"/>

but an infinite number of them, each a fresh starting-point on the road to wisdom.
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="180"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="31"/> Right good too are the words “I will bring

thee again into this land” (<hi rend="italic">ibid</hi>.). For excellent would it have been for the reasoning faculty to have remained in its own keeping and not have left its home for that of sense-perception; but, failing that, it is well that it should return to itself again.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="181"><p> Perhaps,

too, in these words he hints at the doctrine of the immortality of the soul: for, as was said a little before, it forsook its heavenly abode and came into the body as into a foreign land. But the Father who gave it birth says that He will not permanently disregard it in its imprisonment, but will take pity on it and loose its chains, and escort it in freedom and safety to its mother-city, and will not stay his hand until the promises given by words have been made good by actual deeds: for it is the special attribute of God and of Him alone to say what will surely come to pass. And yet what need to say this?</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="182"><p> For His

words are in no way different from deeds.
<milestone unit="para"/>So, then, the practising soul, now fully roused and ready for the inquiry into what concerns Him that is, at first made the conjecture that He is in a place, but after a little while, it is seized with fear at the unscrutable nature of the quest and begins to change its mind.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="183"><p><ref target="5-393-a"/>  For we read “Jacob rose up and said, that the

Lord is in this place, but I knew it not” (<hi rend="italic">ibid</hi>. 16). And it would have been better, I should say, to be


<pb n="395"/>

ignorant than to suppose that God is in some place Who Himself contains and encompasses all things.
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="184"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="32"/> Rightly, therefore, was he afraid and said

in an awestruck tone, “How dreadful is this place”
(<hi rend="italic">ibid</hi>. 17). For indeed most difficult of the “places”
in the study of nature’s verities is that in which men inquire as to where, and whether at all <hi rend="italic">in</hi> any thing the Existent Being is. Some say that everything that subsists occupies some space, and of these one allots to the Existent One this space, another that, whether inside the world or a space outside it in the interval between worlds.<ref target="5-395-a"/>  Others maintain that the Unoriginate resembles nothing among created things, but so completely transcends them, that even the swiftest understanding falls far short of apprehending Him and acknowledges its failure.
</p></div><div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="185"><p>
Wherefore he straightway cried aloud “This is not”

(<hi rend="italic">ibid</hi>. 17); this that I supposed, “that the Lord is in some place “(<hi rend="italic">ibid</hi>. 16), is not so; for according to the true reckoning He contains, but is not contained. But this that we can point out and see, this world discerned by sense, is, as I now know, nothing but a house of “God,” that is, of one of the Potencies of the Existent, that is, the Potency which expresses His goodness.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="186"><p> The world which he named a “house,” he

also described as “gate of” the real “heaven” (<hi rend="italic">ibid</hi>. 17). Now what is this? The world which only intellect can perceive, framed from the eternal forms in Him<ref target="5-395-b"/>  Who was appointed in accordance with Divine bounties, cannot be apprehended otherwise than by passing on to it from this world which we see and perceive by our senses.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="187"><p> For neither indeed is it

possible to get an idea of any other incorporeal thing among existences except by making material objects

<pb n="397"/>

our starting-point. The conception of place was gained when they were at rest: that of time from their motion, and points and lines and superficies, in a word extremities from the robe-like exterior which covers them.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="188"><p> Correspondingly, then, the conception

of the intelligible world was gained from the one which our senses perceive: it is therefore a kind of gate into the former. For as those who desire to see our cities go in through gates, so all who wish to apprehend the unseen world are introduced to it by receiving the impression of the visible world. The world whose substance is discernible only by intellect apart from any sight whatever of shapes or figures, but only by means of the archetypal eternal form present in the world which was fashioned in accordance with the image beheld by him with no intervening shadow,—that world shall change its title, when all its walls and every gate has been removed and men may not catch sight of it from some outside point, but behold the unchanging beauty, as it actually is, and that sight no words can tell or express.
<milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="33"/> On this matter enough has been said.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="189"><p>

There is another dream of the same type as the one we have been studying. It is the one concerning the flock whose markings varied. When he to whom it appeared has risen up<ref target="5-397-a"/>  he relates it in these words: “The angel of God said unto me in sleep, ‘Jacob,’ and I said, ‘What is it?’ and he said, ‘Look up with thine eyes and see the he-goats and the rams leaping upon the sheep and the goats how they are pure white and speckled and ashy-sprinkled. For I have seen all that Laban doeth unto thee. I am God that appeared unto thee in God’s Place, where thou anointedst unto Me a pillar and vowedst unto Me

<pb n="399"/>

a vow. Now therefore arise and go forth out of this land and depart into the land of thy nativity, and I will be with thee’” (Gen. xxxi.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="190"><p> 11–13). You see that

the Divine word proclaims as dreams sent from God not only those which appear before the mind under the direct action of the Highest of Causes, but those also which are revealed through the agency of His interpreters and attendant messengers who have been held meet to receive from the Father to Whom they owe their being a divine and happy portion.
Observe also what follows.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="191"><p> The sacred

word deals with some as a king, enjoining on them authoritatively what they are to do, with some as a teacher indicating to pupils what will be for their good, with some as a counsellor suggesting the best decisions, and greatly benefiting them since of themselves they do not know the advantageous course to take. Towards others it acts as a friend with winning condescension imparting to them even many secret truths which are not allowed to reach the ears of the uninitiated.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="192"><p> Sometimes it addresses an inquiry to

this or that one, as it does to Adam, asking “Where art thou? “(Gen. iii. 9), an inquiry to which one might with fitness make the reply “Nowhere,”<ref target="5-399-a"/>  seeing that nothing pertaining to man remains as it is, but all things are in motion, and this is true of soul, and of body, and of things external. For instability characterizes our reasonings, receiving as they do from the same objects not the same but contrary impressions. It characterizes also our body, as is shewn by the changes that occur in every period of life from infancy to old age. It characterizes too matters affecting us from without, tossed about as they are on the current of ever restless chance.

<pb n="401"/>
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="193"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="34"/> When, however, God<ref target="5-401-a"/>  has come

to the company<ref target="5-401-b"/>  of His friends, He does not begin to say His say before He has addressed each such friend calling him by name, in order that they may prick up their ears, and with stillness and attention so listen to the sacred precepts as to remember them for ever; for it is also said in another place, “Keep silence, and hearken” (Deut. xxvii.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="194"><p> 9). It is on this wise that

Moses is addressed at the Bush, for we read “When He saw that he drew nigh to look, the Lord called him from out of the bush saying, ‘Moses, Moses.’ And he said, ‘What is it?’” (Ex. iii. 4). And
Abraham, at the offering up of his beloved and only son as a burnt offering, is so addressed, both when he was beginning<ref target="5-401-c"/>  to offer the sacrifice, and when, after giving proof of his piety, he was prevented from causing to disappear from among men the nature which learns untaught, called Isaac.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="195"><p> For when he

was at the beginning we are told “God did prove Abraham, and said unto him, ‘Abraham, Abraham’; and he said ‘Here am <milestone unit="altchapter" n="1"/>’ And He said, ‘Take thy beloved son, whom thou lovedst, even Isaac, and offer him up.’” And when he had now brought the victim to the altar, then “an angel of the Lord called to him out of heaven, saying ‘Abraham, Abraham.’ And he said, ‘Here am <milestone unit="altchapter" n="1"/>’ And he said, ‘Lay not thine hand upon the lad, neither do thou anything unto him’” (Gen. xxii. 1, 2, 9–12).
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="196"><p><milestone unit="para"/>The Practiser being one of the band of friends

of God is, as we might expect, accorded the same prerogative and addressed by name; for we read “The angel of God said to me in sleep, ‘Jacob.’ And


<pb n="403"/>

I said, ‘What is it?’” (Gen. xxxi.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="197"><p> 11). And having

been addressed by name he pays attention, endeavouring to note precisely the signs which appeared: and the signs are the couplings and breedings of thoughts in the guise of animals; for we read: “He lifted up his eyes and saw the he-goats and the rams mounting upon the sheep and the goats” (<hi rend="italic">cf</hi>. Gen. xxxi.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="198"><p> 12). A he-goat is leader of a herd of goats, a ram of a flock

of sheep; and these animals are figures of two perfect ways of thinking, of which the one cleanses and purges a soul from sin, and the other nourishes it and renders it full of high achievements. Such are the leading thoughts at the head of the herds within us; and the herds, possessed of dispositions answering to the names of sheep and goats<ref target="5-403-a"/>  which represent them, dart and go forward towards righteousness with earnestness.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="199"><p> Having therefore opened the hitherto

closed eye of the understanding, Jacob saw the perfect thoughts which correspond to he-goats and rams brought to the sharpest edge both for the diminishing of sins and the increase of all that we ought to do,—saw how they mount the sheep and the goats, that is to say the souls that are still young and tender, just fresh and in the very prime and flower of youth,—saw that they do so, not in the pursuit of irrational pleasure, but using the invisible seed of the doctrines of sound sense.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="200"><p> For rich in offspring is this wedlock,

seeing that it does not bring one body to the embraces of another but mates well-endowed souls with perfect virtues. Mount then, all ye right thoughts and reasonings of wisdom, impregnate, impart seed, and whenever you catch sight of a soul of deep rich virgin soil, pass it not by, but inviting it to union and intercourse with yourselves, render it pregnant and so

<pb n="405"/>

effect its consummation; for all that it brings forth shall be goodly, male offspring “consisting of pure white, speckled and ashy-sprinkled”<ref target="5-405-a"/>  (Gen. xxxi. 10).
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="201"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="35"/> We must search for the force and meaning

of each of these births. Thoroughly-white, then, are the brightest and most conspicuous, “thorough” being often applied to what is great, whence has come the custom of calling what is largely evident and largely notable “thoroughly-evident” and “thoroughly-notable.”</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="202"><p> His wish then is that the

firstborn progeny of the soul which has received the holy seed should be “thoroughly-white,” resembling not a dim light, but a brilliant shining, such as a cloudless ray coming from the sun’s beams would appear in a clear atmosphere at noontide. It is his wish that they be also variegated, not after the fashion of foul leprosy the changeful disease, which assumes so many different forms, nor destined, owing to lack of firmness of judgement, to lead an unstable agitated life, but engraved with inscriptions, and stamped with seals differing one from another but all of them genuine,<ref target="5-405-b"/>  the blending and combination of their proper marks producing a harmony like that of music.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="203"><p> For the art of variegation


has been looked upon by some as so obscure and paltry a matter that they have relegated it to weavers. I on the contrary regard with awe not only the art itself but its very name, and most of all when I fix my eyes upon the sections of the earth, upon the



<pb n="407"/>

spheres of heaven, the many different kinds of animals and plants, and that vast variegated piece of embroidery, this world of ours.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="204"><p> For I am straightway

compelled to think of the artificer of all this texture as the inventor of the variegator’s science, and I do homage to the inventor, I prize the invention, I am dumbfounded at the result, and that though I am incapable of seeing even the smallest part of it, but from the part brought within the range of my vision, if indeed it has been brought, I form in detail a conjecture about the whole on the strength of what analogy leads me to expect.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="205"><p> Furthermore,


I admire the lover of wisdom, for having taken up this same art, in that he sees fit, when he finds a multitude of different things, to bring them together out of difference into oneness and to weave them together. For instance, he takes from the “grammar” taught to children the two first subjects, writing and reading; from the more advanced “grammar” acquaintance with the poets and a learning of ancient history<ref target="5-407-a"/> ; from arithmetic and geometry absolute accuracy in matters which require a making of calculations and noting of proportion; from music rhythms and metres and melodies enharmonic, chromatic, diatonic, conjunct too and disjunct; from rhetoric, conception, expression, arrangement, treatment, memory, delivery<ref target="5-407-b"/> ; from philosophy everything that has been omitted in the items given already, and all things else that constitute the whole life of men,—and from these combined he frames a single work gay and bright to a degree, blending wide learning with readiness to learn still more.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="206"><p> The artificer of this fabric was


called by the holy word Bezaleel (Ex. xxxi. 2 ff.),

<pb n="409"/>

which is when interpreted “in the shadow of God.”
For it is the copies of which he is chief builder, whereas Moses builds the patterns; for this reason the one drew an outline as it were of shadows, while the other fashioned no shadows, but the existences themselves that served as archetypes.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="207"><p> Now if the holy tabernacle was built by the variegator’s

art, and the name of “variegator” or embroiderer is reserved for the sage in the oracles of revelation,<ref target="5-409-a"/> 
<milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="36"/> and the beautiful variegated fabric of God, even this world of ours, has been wrought in its completeness by a knowledge full of all wisdom, how can we do otherwise than welcome variegation as a tool for the making of knowledge?</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="208"><p> Its most holy image shall be enshrined in all the

house of Wisdom both in heaven and on earth. And from it are derived the varieties of thinking which the Practiser’s labour creates, for after those of thorough-white he straightway saw those that were variegated, bearing the impress of the stamp of training.<ref target="5-409-b"/> 
<milestone unit="para"/>Third come the ashy-sprinkled.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="209"><p> And yet what

man of sound sense would not say that these also are of the variegated kind? The fact is that it is not about the difference between beasts that the lawgiver shews this deep concern, but rather about the way that leads to nobility of life.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="210"><p><ref target="5-409-c"/>  For he wishes the man

who goes in quest of this to besprinkle himself with


<pb n="411"/>

ashes and lustral water, inasmuch as it is recorded that earth and water mixed together and shaped were by the power of the Moulder of men set apart to form this body of ours, wrought as no handiwork, but a product of nature working all unseen.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="211"><p> It is, then,

the beginning of wisdom not to be forgetful of one’s own self, but ever to set before one’s eyes the elements of which one consists; for in this way a man would purge out of himself high vaunting, the most God-abhorred of evil things. For who, when he lays to heart that ashes and water are for him the beginnings of existence, will be puffed up by conceit and raised aloft?</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="212"><p> That is why the lawgiver required those who

were about to sacrifice to besprinkle themselves with the materials I have mentioned. He held no one worthy of offering sacrifices who has not first come to know himself and comprehended human nothingness, inferring from the elements of which he is composed that he is nothing worth.
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="213"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="37"/> These three signs, the thorough-white,

the variegated, the ashy-sprinkled, are seen to be imperfect in the Practiser inasmuch as he is not yet perfect, whereas in the perfect man they too are perfect. Let us see in what way this is true.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="214"><p> When

the great High-priest was about to perform the public services enjoined by law, the holy word required that he should in the first place sprinkle himself with water and ashes (Ex. xxix. 4)<ref target="5-411-a"/>  as a reminder to him of himself—for even that wise one, Abraham, when he was on his way to intercede with God, spoke of himself as earth and ashes (Gen. xviii. 27)—in the next place that he should put on the tunic reaching to the feet, and over it that which he has entitled the

<pb n="413"/>

embroidered or variegated breastplate (Ex. xxix. 5), a representation and copy of the shining constellations.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="215"><p><ref target="5-413-a"/>  For there are, as is evident, two temples of God:

one of them this universe, in which there is also as High Priest His First-born, the divine Word, and the other the rational soul, whose Priest is the real Man; the outward and visible image of whom is he who offers the prayers and sacrifices handed down from our fathers, to whom it has been committed to wear the aforesaid tunic, which is a copy and replica of the whole heaven, the intention of this being that the universe may join with man in the holy rites and man with the universe.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="216"><p> The High Priest has


now been exhibited as having two characteristic marks, the sprinkled and the variegated: the third and most perfect, which is styled thorough-white, we will now proceed at once to indicate. When this same High Priest goes into the inmost part of the Holy Place, he divests himself of the variegated robe, and puts on another one of linen made from the purest kind (Lev. xvi.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="217"><p> 4), a figure of strong fibre,

imperishableness, most radiant light: for fine linen is hard to tear, and is made from no mortal creature,<ref target="5-413-b"/>  and moreover when carefully cleaned has a very brilliant and luminous colour.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="218"><p> What is symbolically

intimated by these figures is, that among those who worship Him that is with guileless purity, there is not one that does not, in the first place, exercise strength of will and judgement by a contempt for human interests which ensnare and hurt and enfeeble us; and, in the second place, laugh to scorn all the unsubstantial aims of mortal men, and set his heart on immortality; and, last of all, live irradiated by the cloudless splendour of truth, no longer entertaining

<pb n="415"/>

any of the creations of false opinion so dear to darkness.
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="219"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="38"/> Let this stand as my description of the

great High Priest marked with the three seals aforesaid, the thorough-white, the variegated, and the ashy-sprinkled. The man whose desires are set on human statecraft, Joseph by name, lays claim, as we can see, neither to the first nor to the third of these marks, but to the intervening one, the variegated, only.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="220"><p> For we are told that he had a coat of varied

colours (Gen. xxxvii. 3). He did not besprinkle himself with lustral rites, from which he would have learned that he was an amalgam of ashes and water, and was incapable of touching the all-white and gleaming vestment, which is virtue, but arrayed himself in the woven robe of statecraft, a robe richly variegated, containing but a most meagre admixture of truth, but many large portions of false, probable, plausible, conjectural matter, out of which sprang up all the sophists of Egypt, augurs, ventriloquists, soothsayers, proficients in decoying, charming, and bewitching, whose insidious artifices it is no easy task to escape.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="221"><p> So Moses shews the insight of a philosopher

in introducing this coat all blood-stained (Gen. xxxvii. 31), since the whole life of the statesman is stained, warring and being warred upon, receiving blows and shots from the mishaps which befall it.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="222"><p> Search then

the man who is thoroughly immersed in public business, the man on whom the interests of the state depend, and do not be daunted by those who hold him in admiration.

then do we invest ourselves with the gauds of political importance, as with some costly garment, and bear ourselves proudly in it, deceived by the fairness of what meets the eye, and not perceiving its insidious and dangerous ugliness which is out of sight and hidden from observation?</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="225"><p> Come, let us cast off this

showy tunic, and put on the sacred one inwoven with the varied embroidery of virtues. So shall we escape also the ambushments, which unskilfulness, ignorance and indiscipline set for our ruin, to which company Laban belongs.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="226"><p> For when the holy word


had cleansed us with the water of sprinkling made ready for our sanctification, and bringing us to the test had decked us with the varied richness of the secrets of true philosophy, and had made us clear and distinct and bright, it censures the evil-designing character stirred up to spoil the effects of the said treatment.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="227"><p> For he says, “I have seen all that Laban

doeth unto thee” (Gen. xxxi. 12), the reverse, that is, of all that I bestowed upon thee, even sore foulness and spuriousness and darkness in every part. | Yet there can be no cowering fear for the man who relies on the hope of the divine comradeship, to whom are addressed the words “I am the God who appeared to thee in the place of God” (Gen. xxxi. 13).

Surely a

right noble cause of vaunting it is for a soul, that God deigns to shew Himself to and converse with it. And do not fail to mark the language used, but carefully

<pb n="419"/>

inquire whether there are two Gods; for we read “I am the God that appeared to thee,” not “in my place” but “in the place of God,” as though it were another’s.<ref target="5-419-a"/>  What, then, are we to say?</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="229"><p> He that is

truly God is One, but those that are improperly so called are more than one. Accordingly the holy word in the present instance has indicated Him Who is truly God by means of the articles saying “I am the God,” while it omits the article when mentioning him who is improperly so called, saying “Who appeared to thee in the place” not “of the God,”
but simply “of God.” 
</p></div><div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="230"><p>
Here it gives the title of

“God” to His chief Word, not from any superstitious nicety in applying names, but with one aim before him, to use words to express facts.<ref target="5-419-b"/>  Thus in another place, when he had inquired whether He that is has any name, he came to know full well that He has no proper name,<ref target="5-419-c"/>  and that whatever name anyone may use of Him he will use by licence of language; for it is not the nature of Him that is to be spoken of, but simply to be.
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="231"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="40"/> Testimony to this is


afforded also by the divine response made to Moses’ question whether He has a name, even “I am He that is” (Ex. iii. 14). It was given in order that, since there are not in God things which man can comprehend, man may recognize His subsistence.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="232"><p> To the souls indeed which are incorporeal and are

occupied in His worship it is likely that He should reveal Himself as He is, conversing with them as friend with friends; but to souls which are still in a

body, giving Himself the likeness of angels, not altering His own nature, for He is unchangeable, but conveying to those which receive the impression of His presence a semblance in a different form, such that they take the image to be not a copy, but that original form itself.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="233"><p> Indeed an old saying


is still current that the deity goes the round of the cities, in the likeness now of this man now of that man, taking note of wrongs and transgressions.<ref target="5-421-a"/>  The current story may not be a true one, but it is at all events good and profitable for us that it should be current.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="234"><p> | And the sacred word ever entertaining


holier and more august conceptions of Him that is, yet at the same time longing to provide instruction and teaching for the life of those who lack wisdom, likened God to man, not, however, to any particular man.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="235"><p><ref target="5-421-b"/>  For this reason it has ascribed to

Him face, hands, feet, mouth, voice, wrath and indignation, and, over and beyond these, weapons, entrances and exits, movements up and down and all ways, and in following this general principle<ref target="5-421-c"/>  in its language it is concerned not with truth, but with the profit accruing to its pupils.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="236"><p> For some there are

altogether dull in their natures, incapable of forming any conception whatever of God as without a body, people whom it is impossible to instruct otherwise than in this way, saying that as a man does so God arrives and departs, goes down and comes up, makes use of a voice, is displeased at wrongdoings, is inexorable in His anger, and in addition to all this has provided Himself with shafts and swords and all other



<pb n="423"/>

instruments of vengeance against the unrighteous.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="237"><p> For it is something to be thankful for if they can be

taught self-control by the terror held over them by these means. Broadly speaking the lines taken throughout the Law are these two only, one that which keeps truth in view and so provides the thought “God is not as man” (Num. xxiii. 19), the other that which keeps in view the ways of thinking of the duller folk, of whom it is said “the Lord God will chasten thee, as if a man should chasten his son” (Deut. viii. 5).
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="238"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="41"/> Why, then, do we wonder any


longer at His assuming the likeness of angels, seeing that for the succour of those that are in need He assumes that of men? Accordingly, when He says “I am the God who was seen of thee in the place of God” (Gen. xxxi. 13), understand that He occupied the place of an angel only so far as appeared, without changing, with a view to the profit of him who was not yet capable of seeing the true God.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="239"><p> For just as those

who are unable to see the sun itself see the gleam of the parhelion and take it for the sun, and take the halo round the moon for that luminary itself, so some regard the image of God, His angel the Word, as His very self.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="240"><p> Do you not see how Hagar, who is the

education of the schools, says to the angel “Thou art the God that didst look upon me”? (Gen. xvi. 13); for being Egyptian by descent she was not qualified to see the supreme Cause. But in the passage upon which we are occupied,<ref target="5-423-a"/>  the mind is beginning, as the result of improvement, to form a mental image of the sovereign Ruler of all such Potencies.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="241"><p> Hence it is



<pb n="425"/>

that He Himself says “I am the God,” whose image thou didst aforetime behold deeming it to be I Myself, and didst dedicate a pillar engraved with a most holy inscription<ref target="5-425-a"/>  (Gen. xxxi. 13); and the purport of the inscription was that I alone am standing (Ex. xvii. 6) and that it was I alone that established the being of all things, bringing confusion and disorder into order and array, and sustained the universe to rest firm and sure upon the mighty Word, who is My viceroy.
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="242"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="42"/> For “pillar” is a symbol of three things, of

standing, of dedicating, of inscription. The standing and inscription have been made clear, but the dedicating demands explanation.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="243"><p> The whole heaven and

the whole world is an offering dedicated to God, and He it is who has created the offering; and all God-beloved souls, citizens of the world, consecrate themselves, allowing no mortal attraction to draw them in the opposite direction, and they never grow weary of devoting and sanctifying their own imperishable life.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="244"><p> Foolish is the man who dedicates a pillar not

to God but to himself, erecting<ref target="5-425-b"/>  what pertains to creation with its tossing this way and that, and holding worthy of laudatory inscriptions things which, richly deserving to be denounced and reproved, had better never have been made subjects for inscriptions at all, or if once so made have been forthwith erased.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="245"><p> This is why the holy word says expressly “Thou shalt

not erect a pillar to thyself” (Deut. xvi. 22); for in reality nothing human does stand, even though some falsely say so till they burst.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="246"><p><ref target="5-425-c"/>  Nay, they do not only

think that they are firmly established but also that



<pb n="427"/>

they deserve honours and inscriptions, being oblivious of Him Who is alone deserving of honour and really stands. For when they turn away and stray out of the course which leads to virtue, sense-perception, the woman inherent in their nature, makes them stray still more, and forces them to run aground.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="247"><p> Wherefore shattered to pieces like a ship, the whole

soul is set up<ref target="5-427-a"/>  after the fashion of a pillar. For the sacred records say that Lot’s wife having turned to what was behind her became a pillar of salt (Gen. xix.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="248"><p> 26). And that is fit and natural, for if one has

not a clear view of what is farther on, of what is worth seeing and hearing, of virtues, that is to say, and virtuous actions, but turns round to look at<ref target="5-427-b"/>  what is behind and at his back; if he pursues the deafness of glory, the blindness of wealth, the stupidity of bodily robustness, and the empty-mindedness of external beauty, and all that is akin to these, he will be set up as a soulless pillar, with its substance streaming down from it; for salt has no firmness.
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="249"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="43"/> Right well, then, does the Practiser, having

learned by continuous exercises that creation is of itself a thing of movement, whereas the Unoriginate is free from alteration and from movement, raise a pillar to God, and having raised it anoints it: for we read “Thou anointedst unto Me a pillar” (Gen. xxxi.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="250"><p> 13). But imagine not that here we have a

stone anointed with oil; rather that the doctrine of God as the only Being that stands is exercised and practised in a soul with the trainer’s science, not that by which bodies are made stout and brawny, but that by which understanding acquires a vigour and strength which no opponent can overcome.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="251"><p> For he



<pb n="429"/>

that has set out for the pursuit of noble practices is a lover of contest and a lover of exercises. Hence having thoroughly mastered the sister art to that of the physician, namely that of the trainer, having put all thoughts of virtue and piety through a course of training and drill, he will dedicate to God an offering most beauteous and firmly established.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="252"><p> Accordingly after the dedication of the pillar he goes

on to say, “Thou didst vow to me a vow” (<hi rend="italic">ibid</hi>.). Now a vow is in the fullest sense a dedication, seeing that a man is said to give a gift to God when he renders to Him not only his possessions but himself the possessor of them.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="253"><p> For the lawgiver says, “He

shall be holy that letteth the locks of the hair of his head grow long” (Num. vi. 5), that is, the man who has made the vow; and if he is holy, he is nothing else than a dedicated offering, seeing that he no more comes in contact with anything unhallowed and profane.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="254"><p> What I say is vouched for by that prophetess and

mother of a prophet, Hannah, whose name is in our tongue “Grace.” For she says that she is giving as a gift to the Holy One her son Samuel (1 Sam. i. 11),<ref target="5-429-a"/>  not meaning a human being but rather an inspired temper possessed by a God-sent frenzy. And “Samuel” means “appointed for God.”

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="1"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="1"/> In setting forth the third kind of God-sent

dreams we may fitly summon Moses to our assistance, that, as he learned when he did not know, he may teach us too in our ignorance regarding their tokens, by throwing light on each. This third kind of dreams arises whenever the soul in sleep, setting itself in motion and agitation of its own accord, becomes frenzied, and with the prescient power due to such inspiration foretells the future.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="2"><p> The first kind

of dreams we saw to be those in which God originates the movement and invisibly suggests things obscure to us but patent to Himself: while the second kind consisted of dreams in which the understanding moves in concert with the soul of the Universe and becomes filled with a divinely induced madness, which is permitted to foretell many coming events.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="3"><p><ref target="5-443-a"/>  In accordance with these distinctions, the Sacred

Guide gave a perfectly clear and lucid interpretation of the appearances which come under the first description, inasmuch as the intimations given by God through these dreams were of the nature of plain oracles. Those which fall under the second description he interpreted neither with consummate clearness nor with excessive indistinctness. A specimen of these is the Vision that appeared on the heavenly

<pb n="445"/>

stairway. For this vision was indeed enigmatic, but the riddle was not in very high degree concealed from the quick-sighted.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="4"><p> The appearances of the

third kind being more obscure than the former, owing to the deep and impenetrable<ref target="5-445-a"/>  nature of the riddle involved in them, demanded a scientific skill in discerning the meaning of dreams. Accordingly all the dreams of this sort recorded by the lawgiver received their interpretation at the hands of men who were experts in the aforesaid science.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="5"><p> Whose


then are the dreams? Does not everybody perceive that they are those of Joseph, those of Pharaoh king of Egypt, and those which the chief baker and chief butler themselves saw?</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="6"><p> It would seem fitting

always to begin our teaching with those which come first; and first to come are those which Joseph saw when from the divisions of the universe, two in number, heaven and earth, two visions were presented to him. From the earth came the dream of the reaping. It runs on this wise: “Methought that we were binding sheaves in the midst of the plain, and my sheaf rose up” (Gen. xxxvii.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="7"><p> 7). The other has to do with the zodiac: “As it were the sun and the moon and eleven stars worshipped me” (<hi rend="italic">ibid</hi>. 9). On the former dream an interpretative

judgement is pronounced in a tone of vehement menace to this effect: “Shalt thou indeed be king over us? or shalt thou indeed be lord over us?” (<hi rend="italic">ibid.</hi> 8). The latter dream again incurs well-merited displeasure:” Shall I and thy mother and thy brethren come to bow down to the ground to worship thee?” (<hi rend="italic">ibid</hi>. 10).
<milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="2"/> So much by way of a foundation.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="8"><p> As we go



<pb n="447"/>

on to build the superstructure let us follow the directions of Allegory, that wise Master-builder, while we investigate the details of either dream. There are, however, in both dreams some prefatory remarks to be listened to first. Some have given the nature of that which is good a wide application, making it extend to many objects; while others have assigned it only to that which is most excellent: the former have regarded it as mixed, while the latter have left it free from admixture.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="9"><p> Now, those who have maintained


that only the morally beautiful is good, preserving it unmixed, have attributed the good to the reasoning faculty, the noblest part in us; while those who have regarded it as mixed have associated it with three things, soul, body, and things external to us. The latter class belong to the softer and luxurious way of life, having been reared up for the greater part of the time from their very cradle in the women’s quarter and in the effeminate habits of the women’s quarter. Those others are austere of life, reared by men, themselves too men in spirit, eager for what will do them good rather than for what is pleasant, and taking food suited to an athlete with an eye to strength and vigour, not to pleasure.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="10"><p> There are two companies as leaders of which Moses

introduces Isaac and Joseph. The noble company is led by Isaac who learns from no teacher but himself, for Moses represents him as weaned (Gen. xxi. 8), absolutely disdaining to make any use of soft and milky food suited to infants and little children, and using only strong nourishment fit for grown men, seeing that from a babe he was naturally stalwart, and was ever attaining fresh vigour and renewing his youth. The company which yields and is ready to

<pb n="449"/>

give in is led by Joseph, 
</p></div><div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="11"><p>
for he is one who does not

indeed take no account of the excellences of the soul, but is thoughtful for the well-being of the body also, and has a keen desire to be well off in outward things; and he is naturally drawn in different directions since he has set before him many ends in life, and as he experiences one counter-attraction after another, he is shaken this way and that and can never attain to fixity.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="12"><p> For indeed our aims<ref target="5-449-a"/>  do not rest in peace like

cities under a treaty, &lt;but engage in war and deliver attacks&gt; and counter-attacks, in turn winning victory and suffering defeat. For at times the appetite flows strongly to wealth and reputation and completely masters the interests of body and soul, and then again is met and driven back by an opposing force, and vanquished by both or one of them.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="13"><p> In

the same way the pleasures of the body descend upon us in gathered force like a cataract deluging and obliterating one after another all the things of the mind; and then, after no long interval, Wisdom with strong and vehement counterblast both slackens the impetus of pleasures and mitigates in general all the appetites and ambitions which the bodily senses kindle in us.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="14"><p> Such is the cycle of unceasing warfare

ever revolving round the many-sided soul; for, when one foe has been laid low, another yet mightier is sure to spring up, after the fashion of the many-headed Hydra; for we are told that on it another head grew to take the place of that which had been cut off; and this is a figurative way of teaching how hard it is to vanquish undying vice so varied in its form, so varied in its offspring.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="15"><p> Do not, then,



<pb n="451"/>

select any single thing &lt;and regard it&gt; as Joseph’s sole portion, but be well assured that he represents Opinion with its vast medley of ingredients.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="16"><p> For there is manifest in him, on the one hand, the rational strain of self-control, which is of the masculine family, fashioned after his father Jacob: manifest,

again, is the irrational strain of sense-perception, assimilated to what he derives from his mother, the part of him that is of the Rachel type: manifest also is the breed of bodily pleasure, impressed on him by association with chief butlers and chief bakers and chief cooks: manifest too is the element of vainglory, on to which as en to a chariot his empty-headedness
makes him mount up, when (Gen. xli. 43) puffed with pride he lifts himself aloft to overthrow equality from its seat.
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="17"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="3"/> In what we have said so far we have been

giving a rough sketch of Joseph’s character. We must now consider in detail each of his dreams. And the one which must be examined first is the one concerning the sheaves. “Methought,” says he, “that we were binding sheaves” (Gen. xxxvii. 7). The very first word, “methought,” is the utterance of one at a loss, hesitating, dimly supposing, not seeing steadily and distinctly.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="18"><p> For “methought”

is a word which becomes those waking up out of deep sleep and still in dreamland, not those who are thoroughly awake and see things clearly.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="19"><p> You will

not find the Practiser Jacob saying “methought,” but “behold a stairway firmly fixed, whose top reached to heaven” (Gen. xxviii. 12), and again “at

<pb n="453"/>

the time that the sheep conceived, I saw them with my eyes in my sleep, and behold the he-goats and the rams leaped upon the sheep and the goats wholly white, and streaked, and sprinkled as though with ashes” (Gen. xxxi.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="20"><p> 10, 11). For the very visions seen

in their sleep are of necessity clearer and purer in the case of those who deem the morally beautiful eligible for its own sake, even as their doings by day are bound to be more worthy of approbation.
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="21"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="4"/> Now, when I listen to him who is telling the

dreams I marvel at his deeming that they were tying up sheaves, not reaping them. The former is the work of unskilled underlings, the latter the business of masters and of those thoroughly well versed in farm work.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="22"><p> For the power to distinguish necessaries of

life from refuse, and plants which supply nourishment from those which do not, and genuine from spurious, and a highly profitable fruitage from a root that is devoid of profit, in things yielded by the understanding, not in those which the soil puts forth, is a mark of consummate excellence.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="23"><p> So the sacred story

represents those whose eyes are open as reaping, and, what is most unexpected, not reaping barley or wheat but reaping out the reaping itself: accordingly it is said” When ye reap your reaping, ye shall not finish that which remains of the reaping” (Lev. xix.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="24"><p> 9). For the lawgiver wishes the virtuous man to be not

only a judge of things that differ, distinguishing and separating things which produce and their productions, but to do away with the very conceit that he has the power to distinguish, mowing the very mowing and cutting away the workings of his own mind, in obedience to and belief in Moses’ saying that “judgement belongs to God only” (Deut. i. 17),

<pb n="455"/>

with Whom in all matters comparisons and distinctions rest: to acknowledge defeat at whose hands is a noble thing and more glorious than far-famed
victory.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="25"><p> Like the “reaping the reaping” is the

two-fold circumcision, which we meet with in such a case as that of the lawgiver devising as a new practice a circumcision of circumcision (Gen. xvii. 13), or “the consecration of a consecration” (Num. vi. 2), that is, the purification of the very purification of the soul, when we yield to God the prerogative of making bright and clean, and never entertain the thought that we ourselves are sufficient apart from the divine overseeing guidance to cleanse our life and remove from it the defilements with which it abounds.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="26"><p> To this class belongs also the


“double cave” (Gen. xxiii. 9), that pair of precious memories<ref target="5-455-a"/>  concerned, one with all that has come into being, the other with Him who has made it. These constitute the nurture of the man of worth, for whom all things in the universe are objects of contemplation, and who loves to inquire also concerning the Father who brought them into being.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="27"><p> I imagine

that the discovery of the double diapason<ref target="5-455-b"/>  in music is to be traced to this same pair. For both the work and its Fashioner must needs be celebrated by two quite perfect melodies, not the same in each case.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="28"><p> For since the themes of praise were different it was

necessary for the corresponding musical harmonies to be distinct also, the conjunct assigned to the conjunct universe, compacted as it is of different



<pb n="457"/>

parts, the disjunct reserved for Him Who is in virtue of His existence disjunct from all creation, even God.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="29"><p> There is again a statement breathing love of virtue

expressed in the words of the Sacred Guide, “Ye shall not<ref target="5-457-a"/>  make an end of what remains of the reaping” (Lev. xix. 9), for he does not forget the principle with which he set out, acknowledging that “the end is the Lord’s” (Num. xxxi. 28 ff.), with whom rests the lordship and establishment of these things.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="30"><p> But in fact the man who has never learned the

mysteries of reaping vaunts him saying,” Methought I was in company with others binding sheaves which I had not reaped” (Gen. xxxvii. 7), and failed, as I pointed out a little while ago, to take into account that this is a service performed by unskilled slaves.
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="31"><p><milestone unit="para"/>When we assign to words their figurative meaning

we say that sheaves are “doings” which each of us grasps with the hand as his proper nourishment, hoping that he will find life and occupation therein for ever.
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="32"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="5"/> Now, the varieties of the sheaves, that

is to say of the doings which may be called our nourishment, are so countless, so countless also the various sorts of men who lay hold of and make choice of the sheaves, that it is impossible to recount or even to conceive of them all. It may not, however, be out of place to instance some of these varieties which are introduced in his story of his dream.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="33"><p> For he says to

his brothers, “Methought we were binding sheaves” (<hi rend="italic">l.c.</hi>). Brothers he has ten who are sons of the same father as he, one who is son of the same mother; and the name of each of them is the symbol of a most

essential “doing.” “Reuben” is the symbol of good natural endowments, for “seeing son” he is called, in so far as he is a son not perfect, but in so far as he is a man with power to see and keenness of vision, well endowed by nature.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="34"><p> Symeon, which

means “diligent listening,” is the symbol of aptness to learn; Levi of excellent activities and practices and sacred ministries; Judah of songs and hymns addressed to God; Issachar of rewards rendered as recompense for noble deeds, the deeds themselves, it may be, constituting the perfect reward; Zabuion of light, since he is named “night’s flowing,” and when night fails and flows away, light of necessity dawns;</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="35"><p> of distinguishing and analysing matters Dan is the

symbol; Gad of piratical attack and counter-attack; Asher, whose name signifies “felicitation,” symbolizes natural wealth, which has the reputation of being a possession conferring felicity;</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="36"><p> Naphthali’s name

denotes a “broadening” or “flung wide open,” and so he is a symbol of peace, by which all things are opened out and given width, just as they are shut in by war.

since Moses the revealer preserves from destruction the story of his repentance, so worthy of love and remembrance, under the symbol of the bones which he held should not be suffered to remain buried for ever in Egypt (Ex. xiii. 19).

Zodiac, the largest of the circles of heaven, is formed into constellations out of twelve signs, called <hi rend="italic">zodia</hi> or “creatures” from which also it takes its name. The sun and the moon, they say, ever revolve along the circle and pass through each of the signs, though the two do not move at the same speed, but at unequal rates as measured in numbers, the sun taking thirty days and the moon about a twelfth of that time, that is two and a half days.</p></div>

being for his sake and that they must each of them, earth, water, air, heaven, pay their tribute to him as king.

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="133"><p>


let us now consider separately the rank and file which follow them. They are for ever plotting

mischief and evil against the practisers of virtue, and when they see them zealous to brighten their life with the light of guileless truth and irradiate it with moonbeams as it were and with pure sunlight, they hinder them by deceit or violence and drive them down to the sunless region of the impious where deep night reigns and endless darkness, and innumerable tribes of spectres and phantoms and dream-illusions. And when they have brought them to their setting there they compel them to do obeisance to themselves as masters.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="134"><p> For we understand by the sun the

practiser of wisdom, since it provides light for material things even as the other does for the immaterial things of the soul.<ref target="5-503-a"/>  And by the moon we understand the instruction which serves the wise, for both render a service most pure and useful in lightening a night, while the excellent thoughts and reasonings, the children as it were of instruction and the practising soul, are the brethren.<ref target="5-503-b"/>  These it is who rule aright the straight path of life, but those who purpose to say nothing and think nothing that is wholesome deem well to ply them all with wrestling-grips of manifold turns and twists, with the throat-clutch which dislocates the neck, or the leg-fall which brings the wrestler with a thud to the ground.
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="135"><p>And therefore one of this sort is gently

rebuked by his father, not Jacob, but by that right reason which is higher and greater than Jacob. “What is this dream which you dreamt?” (Gen. xxxvii. 10), he says.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="136"><p> “You did not dream,” he

means, “or did you suppose that the naturally free would be forced into slavery to the human, the powers which rule into subjection and, more unreasonable still, made subject not to some others but

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="137"><p> Nay, no

he would say. “Why charge me as you charge those who have deliberately gone wrong? I did but tell you what came upon me from without and struck my mind suddenly through no action of my own.”
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="138"><p>But the fact is that we are not concerned here with

a dream, but with things that resemble dreams: things which seem great and brilliant and desirable to those who are not very well purified, but are small and dull and ridiculous in the eyes of uncorrupted judges of truth.

address our prayers to vanity?</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="140"><p> Shall we first bow<ref target="5-507-a"/> 

and then cast ourselves to the ground in supplication and obeisance?” No, may the sun never shine on these happenings, since deep darkness befits things evil and bright light the good, and what greater evil could there be than that vanity the fictitious and deceiver should receive praise and admiration, usurping the place of its opposite, simplicity in whom there is no fiction or falsity.

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="141"><p><milestone unit="para"/>There is a further excellent lesson in the words,

“The father retained the saying” (Gen. xxxvii. 11). For surely it is the business of a soul which is no youngster nor barren nor sterile but verily an elder and skilled in parenthood, to take caution for its life-mate,
to despise nothing at all but to crouch in awe before the power of God which none can evade or defeat, and to look with circumspection to see what end shall befall it.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="142"><p> And so the oracles say that the

sister of Moses, to whom we who deal in allegory give the name of “Hope,” “spied out from a distance” (Ex. ii. 4), looking doubtless to the consummation of life, that it may meet us with good auspice sent down from high heaven by the Consummator.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="144"><p> Multitudes, too, have

fought manfully for years in cruel warfare and remained unwounded without even a scratch or a pinprick: they have returned in mirth and in gladness as though war were a public festival and a civic banquet, without a limb missing or unsound, and then in their own homes have been conspired against by those who should have been the last to do such a deed and slaughtered as the saying goes like “oxen at the stall.”<ref target="5-509-a"/>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="146"><p> Who has never been tripped up and

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="147"><p> Do we not know by

experience of men who have passed from childhood to old age without feeling any disturbance of soul, because nature has so blessed them, or through the care of those who rear and train them or through both—men full of the profound inward peace which is the only true peace of which the peace of cities is but a copy—men who have therefore been held






<pb n="511"/>

happy because they have never known even in their dreams the intestine war kindled by passion, the cruellest of wars—and then at the very eventide of life they have been wrecked on the rock of an unlocked tongue or insatiate greed of belly, or in uncontrolled lasciviousness of the lower-lying parts.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="148"><p> For some “on the threshold of old age”<ref target="5-511-a"/>  affect the

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="153"><p>

Must we not believe that, since the troop of unreason has made the soul its province, we have within ourselves a herd of brute cattle and a herdsman too, the ruling mind?</p></div>

For it is the nature of anarchy to plot mischief and of government to bring salvation, and chiefly so where law and justice are honoured, and that means government based on reason.
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="155"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="23"/> Here we may conclude our close study of

the dreams of vainglory. As for gluttony it has two forms—drinking and eating, and the spicings and the flavourings needed are by no means simple in the former, but innumerable in the latter. These are entrusted to two caretakers: the liquor treated with nicety to a chief butler, the more elaborate edibles to a chief baker.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="156"><p> There is a carefully considered meaning

in describing the dreams as appearing to both




<pb n="515"/>

these in a single night. They both aim at serving the same need, for it is not simple nutrition which they prepare but nutrition accompanied with pleasure and delight.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="157"><p> And though the labour of each deals with but a half of nutrition they are both concerned with the whole: each half attracts the other, for after 

eating men at once desire to drink and after drinking no less quickly to eat, and this is one of the chief reasons for assigning the same time to the dreams of both.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="158"><p> Now the province of the chief butler is drunkenness 

and of the chief baker gluttony. Each in his vision sees what fits his trade, wine and the parent plant of wine, the vine, in the first case, in the second loaves of the finest meal disposed on baskets which the baker saw himself carrying (Gen. xl.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="159"><p> 16, 17). It 

would be well to examine the former dream first. It runs as follows: “In my sleep there was a vine over against me, and on the vine were three stalks,<ref target="5-515-a"/>  and itself was blossoming having put forth shoots. The grapes in the cluster were ripe, and Pharaoh’s cup was in my hand, and I took the cluster and squeezed it into the cup and I gave the cup into Pharaoh’s hand” (Gen. xl.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="160"><p> 9–11). The prefacing 

with the words “in my sleep” is as striking as the words are true. For indeed he who gives way to the intoxication which is of folly rather than of wine bears a grudge against upright standing and wakefulness, and lies prostrate and sprawling like sleepers with the eyes of his soul closed, unable to see or hear aught that is worth seeing or hearing.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="161"><p> And thus 

brought low, as he passes through life he finds no road but a pathless tract where neither eye nor hand


<pb n="517"/>

can guide him. He is pierced by brambles and thorn-bushes and sometimes rolls over precipices or charges into others, bringing miserable destruction both to himself and them.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="162"><p> And that deep and abysmal sleep 

which holds fast all the wicked robs the mind of true apprehensions, and fills it with false phantoms and untrustworthy visions and persuades it to approve of the blameworthy as laudable: thus in the present case the dreamer treats sorrow as a joy and does not perceive that the vine of his vision is the plant which (produces) folly and madness.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="163"><p> “There was,” he said, 

“a vine before me” (Gen. xl. 9), the wanted and the wanter, wickedness and the wicked, facing each other. That vine we fools till, little thinking that it is to our own harm, and we eat and drink its fruit, thus ranking it with both kinds of nutriment, a possession which proves to entail no half measure but a wholesale complete totality of mischief.
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="164"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="24"/> But we should not fail to understand that a 

strong drink produced by the vine does not affect all who take it in the same way; often it acts in opposite ways so that some may be reckoned as bettered by it and others worsened.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="165"><p> With some it relaxes 

pensiveness and gloom, lightens the stress of cares, softens wrath and fears, tutors the temperament to reasonableness and makes the soul contented with itself. With others it lubricates anger, screws up grief, excites amorousness and rouses discourtesy. It unlocks the mouth and unbridles the tongue, unbars the senses, maddens the passions, and makes the




<pb n="519"/>

mind savage and wild and flustered with everything it meets.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="166"><p> Thus the condition in the former case 

seems to resemble still cloudless weather in the air, or unruffled calm in the sea, or undisturbed peace and tranquillity in the city; while that of the latter resembles a fierce violent blast, a stormy billowy sea or civil faction, the turmoil of which is more hateful than even uncivilized warfare.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="167"><p> Thus in one of two 

convivial gatherings we may find nothing but laughter and sport, guests promising, expecting and conferring kindnesses, pleasant feelings and pleasant talk, cheerful faces, glad hearts and freedom from restraint;</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="168"><p> in the other nothing but anxiety, depression, 

quarrellings, revilings, woundings, while the guests snort, scowl and bark, and fight it out with neck-grips, wrestling and fisticuffs, gnawing off ears and noses or any limbs or parts of the body that come handy,<ref target="5-519-a"/>  and thus exhibiting their life-long inebriation and tipsiness with every kind of misconduct in this far from sacred contest.
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="169"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="25"/> The deduction 

follows that the vine symbolizes two things—folly and gladness. Each of them is shewn by many proofs, but to avoid prolixity I will give only a few.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="170"><p> There was a time when he led us along the 

way of philosophy, the way of the desert, barren of passions and of wrongdoings, and took us as to the high land and there set right reason on a peak of wide view and bade it survey the whole land of virtue, whether it is rich and deep of soil, fertile of grass and





<pb n="521"/>

fruit, and well fitted both to give increase to the lessons there sown and to raise the stalk of tree-like verities there planted, or the opposite of all this; survey, too, the actions which are as cities, whether they are thoroughly well fenced and secure, or uncovered and stripped of the security which is as a wall; survey the inhabitants, too, whether they have increased in number and strength, or whether they are weak through fewness, or few through weakness<ref target="5-521-a"/>  (Num. xiii.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="171"><p> 18–21). And it was then that, unable to carry 

the whole main-stalk of wisdom, we cut a single branch and cluster of grapes and raised it up, a manifest sign of joy, as the lightest of burdens, meaning by the vine so rich in clustering grapes to shew forth to those of keen mental vision the sprouting and fruit-bearing alike of noble living (Num. xiii. 24).<ref target="5-521-b"/> 
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="172"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="26"/> This vine of which we could take but a part

which contemplates God and the world, for Israel means “seeing God,” while the house of the mind is the whole soul, and this is that most holy vineyard which has for its fruit that divine growth, virtue.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="174"><p> So great and splendid is happy thinking, for that is 

the original meaning<ref target="5-521-c"/>  of gladness or εὐφροσύνη, that Moses tells us that God does not disdain to feel and

shew it, particularly when the human race turns away from its sins and inclines and reverts to righteousness, following by a free-will choice the laws and statutes of nature.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="175"><p> “For the Lord, thy God,” he says, “will

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="176"><p> 9, 10). What could be better able to 

implant the yearning for virtue or an ardour for noble living than this? Dost thou wish, O mind, that God should be glad? Be glad thyself, and bring Him no costly gift (for what does He need of what is thine?), but contrariwise accept rejoicing all the good things which He gives thee.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="177"><p> For it gladdens Him to give 

when the recipients are worthy of His bounty, since you surely must admit that if those who live a life of guilt can be rightly said to provoke and anger God, those whose life is laudable may be equally well said to gladden Him.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="178"><p> Mortal parents, fathers and 

mothers, vast as are their deficiencies, are gladdened by nothing so much as by the virtues of their children. And shall not the Begetter of all, in Whom is no deficiency at all, be gladdened by the noble living of His creatures?</p></div>

pressing without a pause to the boundaries of land and ocean. For they do not dwell apart in the far distance, nor are they banished from the habitable world, but, as Moses says (Deut. xxx. 12–14), the good is stationed just beside thee and shares thy nature, close bound with the three most essential parts, heart, mouth and hands, that is mind, speech, actions, since to think and speak and do the morally good is the essential thing, a fullness composed of good purposing, good action and good speaking.

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="181"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="27"/> Let us say then to one whose business is 

one form of belly-gorging, namely deep-drinking, that is to the chief butler, “Why in this evil plight, thou fool?

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="182"><p> But he, perhaps, may answer: “Do not upbraid me 

so rashly, without first considering how I stand. My appointed task is to be cup-bearer, not to one invested with self-control and piety and the other virtues, but to one steeped in greed, licentious, unjust, priding himself on his impiety, he who once dared to say, ‘I know not the Lord’ (Ex. v. 2). Naturally I, on my side, have busied myself with what gives him pleasure.”</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="183"><p> And wonder not that 

God and Pharaoh, the mind which usurps the place of God, find gladness in things opposite to each other. Who then is God’s cup-bearer? He who pours the libation of peace, the truly great high priest who first receives the loving-cups of God’s perennial bounties, then pays them back when he pours that potent undiluted draught, the libation of himself.<ref target="5-525-a"/>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="184"><p> Thus I, the servant of that Pharaoh who 

keeps his stubborn incontinent thinking in an intensity of looseness, am an eunuch (Gen, xl. 7), gelded of the soul’s generating organs, a vagrant from the men’s quarters, an exile from the women’s, a thing neither male nor female, unable either to shed or receive seed, twofold yet neuter, base counterfeit of the human coin, cut off from the immortality which, through the succession of children and children’s children, is kept alight for ever, roped off from the holy assembly and congregation. “For he that hath lost the organs of generation is absolutely forbidden to enter therein” (Deut. xxiii. 1).

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="185"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="28"/> But the high priest is blameless, 

perfect, the husband of a virgin (Lev. xxi. 12, 13) who, strange paradox, never becomes a woman, but rather has forsaken that womanhood through the company of her husband (Gen. xviii. 11).

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="190"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="29"/> We have explained one kind of vine, that 

which is the property of gladness, and the potent drink which it gives, undiluted wise counsel, and also the cup-bearer who draws it from the divine mixing-bowl which God Himself has filled to the brim with virtues.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="191"><p> The other kind, the vine of folly 

and grief and wine frenzy, has already been explained in a way, but it is represented typically otherwise by the words spoken elsewhere in the Greater Song.<ref target="5-529-d"/> 

<pb n="531"/>

“Their vine,” he says, “is of the vine of Sodom and their tendrils of Gomorrah, their grapes are grapes of gall, a cluster of bitterness to them. Their wine is the wrath of dragons and the incurable wrath of asps” (Deut. xxxii.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="192"><p> 32, 33). You see what the 

potent wine-cup of folly produces: bitterness, evil temper, sudden passionateness, deep anger, savageness, stinging spite, maliciousness. Most forcible are his words when he says that the plant of folly is in Sodom, for Sodom means blinding or making barren, since folly is blind and unproductive of excellence, and through its persuasions some have thought good to measure and weigh and count everything by the standard of themselves, for Gomorrah by interpretation is “measure.”</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="193"><p> But Moses held that 

God, and not the human mind, is the measure and weighing scale and numbering of all things.<ref target="5-531-a"/>  And he shews it in these words: “There shall not be in thy pouch divers weights, great and small. There shall not be in thy house divers measures great and small. A true and a just weight thou shalt have” (Deut. xxv.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="194"><p> 13–15). And the true and just measure 

is to hold that God Who alone is just measures and weighs all things and marks out the confines of universal nature with numbers and limits and boundaries, while the false and unjust measure is to think that these things come to pass as the human mind directs.
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="195"><p><milestone unit="para"/>This eunuch and chief cup-bearer in one to Pharaoh, 

after seeing in his vision the parent plant of folly, the vine, goes on to picture it with three roots, to suggest the extremes which can be reached in sinning through


<pb n="533"/>
the three divisions of time, for the root is the extreme.
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="196"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="30"/> When then folly overshadows and masters 

the whole soul and suffers no part of it to go at large and in freedom, it compels him to commit, not only such sins as may be remedied, but also such as are incurable.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="197"><p> The sins which admit of healing treatment 

are described as the lightest and first in the list; those that are beyond treatment as hard indeed and coming last, thus corresponding to roots.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="198"><p> And 

just as wisdom begins its benefits with the lesser of right actions and ends with them at their highest point, so folly, I think, forces the soul down from the height and little by little removes it from instruction and sets its dwelling far apart from right reason and brings it in ruin to the uttermost extremes.
</p></div><div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="199"><p>
After the roots the dream shewed him 

the vine blossoming and sprouting and bearing fruit. “It was blossoming itself, having put forth shoots. The grapes of the cluster were ripe” (Gen. xl.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="200"><p> 10). Would that fruitlessness might be its lot, that it might never put forth green shoots and remain withered for all time, for what greater evil could 

there be than that folly should blossom and be fruitful? Again, the cup of Pharaoh, the receptacle of senselessness and wine-frenzy and ceaseless life-long intoxication, is, he says, “in my hand” (Gen. xl. 11), that is, in the enterprises which I take in hand, in my projects and faculties, for without the activities of my mind passion by itself will make little headway.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="201"><p> The reins should be in the 

hands of the driver, and the rudder in the hands of




<pb n="535"/>

the pilot, since only so can the chariot go aright in the race or the ship on its voyage. Even so in the hand and power of the craftsman, who produces one form of belly-gorging, namely wine-bibbing, is the task of filling the incontinent man.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="202"><p><ref target="5-535-a"/> But

what was he thinking of, that he did not shrink from boasting over an action which called for denial rather than confession? Were it not a better course, instead of confessing that he was the teacher of incontinence, to ascribe the incentives to passion to the incontinent one himself as inventor and author of his own base, unmanly, invertebrate life?</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="203"><p> But

the fact is that folly prides herself on matters which should make her hide her face in shame. In this case she not only glories in carrying round the cup, the receptacle of the incontinent soul, and displaying it to all, but in squeezing the grapes into it, and this means manufacturing the stuff which brings passion to its fullness and drawing it out of concealment into the light.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="204"><p> For just as babes who want to be fed,

when they are going to suck the milk, squeeze and press the nurse’s breast, so the maker of incontinence presses hard on the fountain from which the curse of wine-bibbing pours like rain, to find in the squeezed droppings a nourishment of delicious sweetness.
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="205"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="31"/> Thus then let us describe that wine-maddened,

raving, incurable pest, the man frenzied by strong liquor. But his fellow, himself too a belly-slave, the friend of gross eating and gluttony, the dissolute artificer of viands, must be considered in his turn.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="206"><p> Yet we need little thought in our quest of

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="207"><p> “I thought,” it says, “that I lifted three

baskets of wheaten loaves on my head” (Gen. xl. 16). “Head” we interpret allegorically to mean the ruling part of the soul, the mind on which all things lie, and once indeed that mind cried out loudly and bitterly,<ref target="5-537-a"/>  “All these things have been upon me” (Gen. xlii.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="208"><p> 36). So then he marshals the procession of all the arts

which he contrived against the unhappy belly, and bearing the ritual<ref target="5-537-b"/>  basket himself is not ashamed, poor fool, to be burdened with a triple load of baskets, that is with the three divisions of time.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="209"><p> For pleasure is

said by her votaries to consist of the memory of past, the enjoyment of present and the hope of future delights.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="210"><p><ref target="5-537-c"/>  Thus the three baskets are likened to the

three divisions of time, and the baked meats in the baskets to the concomitants of each of these divisions, memories of the past, participations of the present, expectations of the future, and he who bears all these to the pleasure-lover, who has loaded the table not with one general kind of incontinence, but with practically every species and genus of licentiousness, and that board has no peace-draughts and lacks the salts of friendship.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="211"><p> At this board there is one banqueter

only, and yet to him it is as a public feast: that banqueter is King Pharaoh, who has made dispersion and scattering and the undoing of continence

his business, for his name means “scattering.” And he shews his great importance and kingship not in delighting in the seemly, the good cheer of temperance, but in glorying in the unseemly, the practices of foulness, wrecked as he is on the rocks of insatiableness and greediness and luxurious living. And therefore the birds (Gen. xl.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="212"><p> 17), that is the

unforeseen chance events which swoop upon us from without, will overrun like fire all the contents and set them ablaze and consume them with their devouring force, so that not a fragment is left to be enjoyed by the basket-bearer who had hoped to carry his inventions and projects for ever as a secure and permanent possession never to be taken from him.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="213"><p> But thanks

be to the victorious God who, however perfect in workmanship are the aims and efforts of the passion-lover, makes them to be of none effect by sending invisibly against them winged beings to undo and destroy them.

</p></div><div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="219"><p>
You note the opening words of

the self-lover, who, in body and soul alike, is the subject of movement and turning and change. “I thought I stood,” he says, and does not reflect that to be unswerving and stable belongs only to God and to such as are the friends of God.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="220"><p> God’s unswerving

power is proved most clearly by this world which ever remains the same unchanged, and, since the world is firmly balanced, its maker must needs be steadfast.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="221"><p> We have other infallible witnesses in the sacred oracles, for we have these words with God as speaker:



<pb n="543"/>

“Here I stand there before thou wast, on the rock in Horeb”<ref target="5-543-a"/>  (Ex. xvii. 6), which means, “This I, the manifest, Who am here, am there also, am everywhere, for I have filled all things. I stand ever the same immutable, before thou or aught that exists came into being, established on the topmost<ref target="5-543-b"/>  and most ancient source of power, whence showers forth the birth of all that is, whence streams the tide of wisdom.”</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="222"><p> For I am He “Who brought the fountain of

water from out the steep rock,”<ref target="5-543-c"/>  as it says elsewhere (Deut. viii. 15). And Moses too gives his testimony to the unchangeableness of the deity when he says “they saw the place where the God of Israel stood” (Ex. xxiv. 10), for by the standing or establishment he indicates his immutability.
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="223"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="33"/> But

indeed so vast in its excess is the stability of the Deity that He imparts to chosen natures a share of His steadfastness to be their richest possession. For instance, He says of His covenant filled with His bounties, the highest law and principle, that is, which rules existent things, that this God-like image shall be firmly planted with the just soul as its pedestal. For so He declares when he says to Noah, “I will establish My covenant on thee” (Gen. ix.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="224"><p> 11). And

these words have two further meanings. First that justice and God’s covenant are identical; secondly that while the gifts bestowed by others are not the same as the recipients’, God gives not only the gifts, but in them gives the recipients to themselves. For He has given myself to me and everything that is to itself, since “I will establish my covenant with thee”



<pb n="545"/>

is the same as “I will give thyself to thee.”</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="225"><p><ref target="5-545-a"/>  And it

is the earnest desire of all the God-beloved to fly from the stormy waters of engrossing business with its perpetual turmoil of surge and billow, and anchor in the calm safe shelter of virtue’s roadsteads.
</p></div><div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="226"><p>
See what is said of wise Abraham, how

he was “standing in front of God” (Gen. xviii. 22), for when should we expect a mind to stand and no longer sway as on the balance save when it is opposite God, seeing and being seen?</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="227"><p> For it gets its equipoise

from these two sources: from seeing, because when it sees the Incomparable it does not yield to the counter-pull of things like itself; from being seen, because the mind which the Ruler judges worthy to come within His sight He claims for the solely best, that is for Himself. To Moses, too, this divine command was given: “Stand thou here with Me” (Deut. v. 31), and this brings out both the points suggested above, namely the unswerving quality of the man of worth, and the absolute stability of Him that is.
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="228"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="34"/> For that which draws near to God

enters into affinity with what is, and through that immutability becomes self-standing.<ref target="5-545-b"/>  And when the mind is at rest it recognizes clearly how great a blessing rest is, and, struck with wonder at its beauty, has the thought that it belongs either to God alone or to that form of being which is midway between mortal and immortal kind.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="229"><p> Thus he says: “And

I stood between the Lord and you” (Deut. v. 5),



<pb n="547"/>

where he does not mean that he stood firm upon his feet, but wishes to indicate that the mind of the Sage, released from storms and wars, with calm still weather and profound peace around it, is superior to men, but less than God.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="230"><p> For the human mind of the common

sort shakes and swirls under the force of chance events, while the other, in virtue of its blessedness and felicity, is exempt from evil. The good man indeed is on the border-line, so that we may say, quite properly, that he is neither God nor man, but bounded at either end by the two, by mortality because of his manhood, by incorruption because of his virtue.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="231"><p> Similar to this is the oracle given about the high

priest: “When he enters,” it says, “into the Holy of Holies, he will not be a man until he comes out” (Lev. xvi.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="232"><p> 17).<ref target="5-547-a"/>  And if he then becomes no man, clearly neither is he God, but God’s minister, through the mortal in him in affinity with creation, through the immortal with the uncreated, and he retains this

midway place until he comes out again to the realm of body and flesh. That it should be so is true to nature. When the mind is mastered by the love of the divine, when it strains its powers to reach the inmost shrine, when it puts forth every effort and ardour on its forward march, under the divine impelling force it forgets all else, forgets itself, and fixes its thoughts and memories on Him alone Whose attendant and servant it is, to whom it dedicates not a palpable offering, but incense, the incense of consecrated virtues.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="233"><p> But when the inspiration is

stayed, and the strong yearning abates, it hastens back from the divine and becomes a man and meets


<pb n="549"/>

the human interests which lay waiting in the vestibule ready to seize upon it, should it but shew its face for a moment from within.
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="234"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="35"/> Moses

then describes the perfect man as neither God nor man, but, as I have said already, on the border-line between the uncreated and the perishing form of being.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="235"><p> While, on the other hand, the man who is on the path of progress is placed by him in the region between the living and the dead, meaning by the former those who have wisdom for their life-mate and by the latter those who rejoice in folly, for we are told

of Aaron that “he stood between the dead and the living, and the breaking abated” (Num. xvi. 48). For the man of progress does not rank either among those dead to the life of virtue, since his desires aspire to moral excellence, nor yet among those who live in supreme and perfect happiness, since he still falls short of the consummation, but is in touch with both.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="236"><p> And therefore he quite properly concludes with the

phrase “the breaking abated,” not “ceased.” For in perfection all the influences which break and crush and fracture the soul do cease, but in the stage of progress they diminish, being so to speak cut down and confined, but nothing more.
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="237"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="36"/> We find, then, that stability or fixity or

permanent immobility, in virtue of its immutable and unchangeable quality, subsists as an attribute primarily to the Existing Being, secondly to His Word which He calls His covenant, thirdly to the Sage, and fourthly to the man of gradual progress. What then could make the wicked mind, fit subject for every manner of curse, think that he could stand alone, when he is carried to and fro as in a flood and swept down by eddy after eddy of the torrent of

<pb n="551"/>

which that dead burden the body is the channel?</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="238"><p> For “I thought,” he says, “that I stood on the edge

of the river” (Gen. xli. 17). River, I submit, is here a symbol of speech, since both flow outward and with a swift strong current, and both are sometimes fruitful in producing inundations, water in one case, words in the other, sometimes unfruitful when they slacken or subside.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="239"><p> And both may be beneficial by

irrigating, one the fields, the other the souls of docile hearers; both at times do harm, the river by flooding the adjoining land, speech by reducing the mental powers of the inattentive to chaos and confusion.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="240"><p> In this way speech is like a river, but it has a twofold

nature better and worse, the better beneficial, the worse necessarily injurious.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="241"><p> Moses has

provided examples of both, of the plainest kind to those who have the gift of vision. “A river,” he says, “goes out of Eden to water the garden; thence it separates into four heads” (Gen. ii.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="242"><p> 10), and he

gives the name of Eden, which is by interpretation “delight,” to the wisdom of the Existent, because no doubt wisdom is a source of delight to God and God to wisdom, and so in the Psalms the singer bids us to “delight in the Lord” (Ps. xxxvii. (xxxvi.) 4). The Divine Word descends from the fountain of wisdom like a river to lave and water the heavensent celestial shoots and plants of virtue-loving souls which are as a garden.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="243"><p> And this holy Word is

“separated into four heads,” which means that it is split up into the four virtues, each of which is royal. For separation into heads or rules is not like separation into local regions but into kingdoms, and when he



<pb n="553"/>

points to virtues he means thereby to declare that the Sage who possesses them is a king, a king appointed not by men but by nature, the infallible, the incorruptible, the only free elector.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="244"><p> Thus it was

said to Abraham by those who saw his worthiness: “thou art a king from God with us” (Gen. xxiii. 6).<ref target="5-553-a"/>  And thus they laid down the doctrine for the students of philosophy, that the Sage alone is a ruler and king, and virtue a rule and a kingship whose authority is final.<ref target="5-553-b"/> 
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="245"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="37"/> It is this Word which one of Moses’

company compared to a river, when he said in the Psalms “the river of God is full of water” (Ps. lxv. (lxiv.) 10); where surely it were senseless to suppose that the words can properly refer to any of the rivers of earth.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="246"><p> No, he is representing the Divine Word as full of the stream of wisdom, with no part of it empty or devoid of itself but a . . ., as it has been called, filled through and through with the influx and lifted up on high by the constant never-failing outflow from that perennial fountain.And there is another psalm

which runs thus: “The strong current of the river makes glad the city of God” (Ps. xlvi. (xlv.) 4). What city? For the existing holy city, where the sacred temple also is, does not stand in the neighbourhood of rivers any more than of the sea. Thus it is clear that he writes to shew us allegorically something different from the obvious.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="247"><p> It is perfectly true

that the impetuous rush of the divine word borne along &lt;swiftly&gt; and ceaselessly with its strong and






<pb n="555"/>

ordered current does overflow and gladden the whole universe through and through.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="248"><p> For God’s city is the

name in one sense for the world which has received the whole bowl, wherein the divine draught is mixed, and feasted thereon and exultingly taken for its possession the gladness which remains for all time never to be removed or quenched. In another sense he uses this name for the soul of the Sage, in which God is said to walk as in a city. For “I will walk in you,” he says, “and will be your God” (Lev. xxvi.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="249"><p> 12). And, when the happy soul holds out the sacred

goblet of its own reason, who is it that pours into it the holy cupfuls of true gladness, but the Word, the Cup-bearer of God and Master of the feast, who is also none other than the draught which he pours—his own self free from all dilution, the delight, the sweetening, the exhilaration, the merriment, the ambrosian drug (to take for our own use the poet’s terms) whose medicine gives joy and gladness?

called in the Hebrew Jerusalem and its name when translated is “vision of peace.” Therefore do not seek for the city of the Existent among the regions of the earth, since it is not wrought of wood or stone, but in a soul, in which there is no warring, whose sight is keen, which has set before it as its aim to live in contemplation and peace.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="251"><p> For what grander or

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="253"><p> Know then, good friend, that God alone is

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="254"><p> Let it be then a matter of indifference that

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="255"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="39"/> Again God promises wise Abraham a

portion of land “from the river of Egypt to the great river Euphrates” (Gen. xv. 18), not meaning a section of country, but rather the better part in ourselves. For our body and the passions engendered in it or by it are likened to the river of Egypt, but the soul and what the soul loves to the Euphrates.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="256"><p> Here he

lays down a doctrine of the greatest importance and value to life, namely, that the good man has received for his portion soul and the soul’s virtues, even as the bad on the other hand has body and the vices which belong to and arise through the body.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="257"><p> Now “from”



<pb n="559"/>

has two meanings, one where the thing from which what we are describing starts is included, the other where it is excluded. For when we say that there are twelve hours from early morning to evening, or thirty days from the new moon to the end of the month, we take into our reckoning the first hours in the former case and the new moon itself in the latter. But when one says that the field is three or four stades distant from the city, clearly he does not include the city.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="258"><p> So in this case we must suppose

that in the phrase “from the river of Egypt” “from” is used in this exclusive sense.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="259"><p> For Moses would have us remove right away from bodily things, which present themselves amid restless flux and motion, which destroys and is destroyed, and receive the soul as our heritage with the virtues which are indestructible and worthy to be such.Thus

our investigation has shewn what was meant when the speech which deserves praise was compared to a river. It follows that speech which calls for censure was none other than the river of Egypt—speech, that is, which is ill-trained, ignorant and practically soulless. And therefore it changes into blood (Ex. vii. 20), since it cannot provide nourishment, for the speech of indiscipline none can drink. And further it is prolific of frogs, bloodless, soulless creatures, whose cry is a strange harsh noise, painful to the hearers.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="260"><p> We are told, too, that all the fish in it died

(<hi rend="italic">ibid.</hi> 21), and by fish thoughts are symbolized. For thoughts swim and are bred in speech as in a river, and like living creatures give vitality to it. But set in undisciplined speech ideas die. For in such speech there is no sense to be found, only “bawling” cries disordered and “unregulated,” as the verse has it.<ref target="5-559-a"/> 

<pb n="561"/>
<milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="40"/> Enough on these points;</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="261"><p> but since in the

words “I thought I stood by the edge of the river” he declares that his dream contained not only a “standing” and a “river,” but also the edges or “lips” of a river, I am bound to make such observations as are suitable on the subject of “lip.”</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="262"><p> Nature

clearly has provided animals and men in particular with lips for two most necessary purposes. One is to keep silence; for the lips form the strongest possible fence and barrier for confining sound. The other is to give expression to thought; for the stream of words flows through the lips. When they are closed that stream is held back, and until they part it cannot take its course.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="263"><p> In this way the lips

train and exercise us for both purposes, speech and silence, and they teach us to watch for the proper occasion for either. For example: Is something said worth hearing? Oppose it not but pay attention silently according to the command of Moses, “Be still and hear” (Deut. xxvii.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="264"><p> 9). None of those who

enter upon wordy controversies can be properly held either to speak or to hear; he who would do &lt;either&gt; in the true sense will find &lt;silence&gt; useful. 
</p></div><div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="265"><p>
Again when

amid the wars and ills of life you see the merciful hand and power of God extended over you as a shield, be still. For that Champion needs no ally, and we have a proof of this in the words which Holy Scripture keeps amid its treasures, “The Lord shall war for you and ye shall be silent” (Ex. xiv.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="266"><p> 14). Once more,

if you see the firstborn of Egypt, true children of their parents, perishing (Ex. xi. 5), even lust, pleasure,




<pb n="563"/>

grief and fear, and injustice, folly, licentiousness with all their brethren and kin, stand in awe and be silent, bending low before the tremendous power of God.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="267"><p> “For not a dog shall make a sound,” it says,

“with his tongue, neither from men to beast” (<hi rend="italic">ibid.</hi> 7), which means that neither the dog-like tongue which barks so loud, nor the man in us, the ruling mind, nor the beast-like creature, sense, should vaunt themselves when, upon the downfall of all that is our own, assistance comes self-bidden from without to shield us.
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="268"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="41"/> But occasions

often arise which ill accord with silence and call for speech in song or prose,<ref target="5-563-a"/>  and of such, too, we may find instructive examples in the same storehouse. How so? Suppose some portion of good has fallen to us unexpectedly. It is well then to give thanks and hymn the sender. And what is that good?</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="269"><p>

Suppose that the passion which was attacking us is dead and has been flung out headlong without burial. Let us not delay, but setting in order our choir raise the most sacred of anthems, bidding all to say “Let us sing unto the Lord, for He hath triumphed gloriously. Horse and rider he hath cast into the sea” (Ex. xv.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="270"><p> 1). But though, no doubt, the destruction

and removal of passion is a good, yet it is not a perfect good, but the discovery of wisdom is a thing of transcendent excellence. And when that is discovered, all the people will sing not with one part of music only, but with all its harmonies and melodies.

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="271"><p>For “then,” says the text, “Israel sang this song

upon the well” (Num. xxi.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="272"><p> 17), and by the “well” I mean knowledge, which for long has been hidden, but in time is sought for and finally found—knowledge whose nature is so deep, knowledge which ever serves to water the fields of reason in the souls of those who desire to see.Again when we reap the

true harvest of the mind, does not the holy Word bid us bring, stored in the basket (Deut. xxvi. 2, 4) of our reasoning faculties, the firstfruits of that rich crop of things excellent, the product of the flowering, the sprouting, the fruit-bearing of ourselves, and as we display them pronounce with words of forthright oratory our laudings of God who gives fulfilment, in such words as these: “I have purged the things hallowed from my home and stored them in the house of God (<hi rend="italic">ibid.</hi> 13) under the stewardship and guardianship of those who have been chosen for their high merit to the sacred temple-ministry.”</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="274"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="42"/> Such is the most fitting rule for speaking

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="275"><p> Yet it is in speech—in saying what they

ought not—that they exercise themselves the most. For they open their mouths and leave them unbridled,

<pb n="567"/>

and suffer their “promiscuous”<ref target="5-567-a"/>  speech, to use the poet’s term, to take its course like an unchecked torrent whirling along with it vast quantities of unprofitable stuff.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="276"><p> And so some betake themselves

to pleading the cause of pleasure and lust and of every superabundant appetite and raise up unreasoning passion to menace the ruling reason. &lt;Others<ref target="5-567-b"/> &gt; disencumber themselves to engage in disputatious controversies, hoping thereby to blind the race of vision and to be able to hurl them over precipices and chasms, from which they can never rise again.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="277"><p> Some,

too, have set themselves up to oppose the virtue not only of men but of God; to such a pitch of madness have they advanced.
<milestone unit="para"/>The first of these three, the company of the pleasure-lovers, are described as having for their leader the king of the country of Egypt. For God says to the prophet, “Behold he himself goeth forth to the water, and thou shalt stand meeting him by the edge (lip) of the river” (Ex. vii.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="278"><p> 15).<ref target="5-567-c"/>  It is as characteristic of

him, that he should ever go out to the spreading tide of unreasoning passion, as it is of the wise to meet its strong current, whose waters are the advocacy of pleasure and lust—meet it not with his feet, but with his judgement, steadfastly and unswervingly, on the “lip” of the river, that is on the mouth and tongue, the organs of speech. For firmly resting on these supports he will be able to overthrow and lay low the plausibilities which plead the cause of passion.

<pb n="569"/>
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="279"><p><milestone unit="para"/>Secondly,<ref target="5-569-a"/>  we find the enemy of the race

that has vision in the people of Pharaoh who attacked and persecuted and enslaved virtue without ceasing, until they received the requital of evil for the evil they meted out to others, submerged in the sea of their wrongdoings and in the mighty billows, which their raving had called up, and thus that occasion brought a peerless spectacle, an undisputed victory, and a joy which transcendedhope.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="280"><p> Therefore we read:

“Israel saw the Egyptians dead along the lip of the sea” (Ex. xiv. 30). Mighty is that champion arm by whose constraining force mouth and lips and speech became the scene of the fall of those who had whetted them as instruments against the truth, that so their own weapons, not those of strangers, should bring death to those who had taken them against others.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="281"><p> Three messages, the best of tidings, does this text

proclaim to the soul, one that the passions of Egypt have perished, a second that the scene of their death is none other than the lips of that fountain bitter and briny as the sea, those very lips through which poured forth the sophist-talk which wars against virtue, and finally that their ruin was seen.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="282"><p> For we may pray that

nothing that is good and beautiful should be unseen, but rather should be brought into clear light and bright sunshine, while its opposite evil deserves only to be brought into night and profound darkness and &lt;night&gt;.

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="283"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="43"/> Third on the list<ref target="5-571-a"/>  were those who extended

the activities of their word-cleverness to heaven itself, men who gave themselves to studies directed against nature or rather against their own soul. They declared that nothing exists beyond this world of our sight and senses, that it neither was created nor will perish, but is uncreated, imperishable, without guardian, helmsman or protector.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="284"><p> Then piling enterprises

one upon another they raised on high like a tower their edifice of unedifying doctrine.<ref target="5-571-b"/>  For we read that “all the earth was one lip” (Gen. xi. 1), a harmony of disharmony, that is a blend of all the parts of the soul, to dislodge from its position the greatest binding force in the universe, government.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="285"><p> And therefore when they hoped to soar to heaven in

mind and thought, to destroy the eternal kingship, the mighty undestroyable hand cast them down and overturned the edifice of their doctrine.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="286"><p> And the

place is called “confusion,” a fitting name for wild audacious revolution. For what is more fraught with confusion than want of government? Are not houses that have no ruler full of offences and disturbance?</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="287"><p> Are not cities left without a king destroyed

collections of animals, whether of the air, or the land or the water, do not hold together any more than men without someone to captain them, but they always desire the presence of their proper leader and pay him honour as the sole author of their welfare, and in his absence they scatter and are destroyed.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="289"><p> Can we then suppose that, while the creatures of the

earth, who are but a tiny portion of the universe, find in government the cause of their well-being and in anarchy the cause of their ills, the world does not owe the supreme blessedness which fills it to the leadership of God its king?</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="290"><p> So then these

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="291"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="44"/> Thus it is their way

to talk bombastic, boastful absurdities such as “We are the leaders, we are the potentates; all things are based on us. Who can cause good or its opposite,

save we? With whom does it really and truly rest to benefit or harm, save us? They are but idle babblers who say that all things are linked to an invisible power, and think that this power presides over everything in the world whether human or divine.”Such is their presumptuousness.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="292"><p>

Yet, if they pass from this intoxication to sobriety, and become themselves again; if realizing the sottishness of their past they feel shame and self-reproach for the sins to which their ill-judging judgement has led them; if they take repentance for their counsellor, a counsellor impervious to flattery and bribery; if they propitiate the merciful power of Him that is by recantations in which holiness replaces profanity, they will obtain full pardon.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="293"><p> But if they

continue for ever to plunge and prance like stiff-necked horses disobedient to the rein, as though they were free and independent and rulers of others, necessity inexorable and implacable will make them feel that in all things great and small they are as nothing.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="294"><p> For the charioteer who has mounted the

winged chariot<ref target="5-575-a"/>  of this world will put his bridle upon them and pull back with force the hitherto slackened reins till they are taut, tighten the muzzles, and with whip and spur recall to them the nature of that imperious authority, which the kindness and gentleness of the ruler had caused them to forget, as bad servants do.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="295"><p> For such misconstrue the mildness of

Thus we read

“the lawless soul which distinguishes with its lips to do well or do ill,”<ref target="5-577-a"/>  and then later “shall proclaim its sin” (Lev. v. 4, 5).

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="297"><p> No, the knowledge and mastery

of these is a gift reserved for God alone, and for whoso is God’s friend. And this is testified by the oracle in which we are told “I will kill and make to live: I will smite and I will heal” (Deut. xxxii.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="298"><p> 39). But

indeed when the soul, wise in its own conceit, entertained this dream of things beyond its ken, it was no fleeting thought, but to its sorrow so puffed up with windy pride was it that it swore an oath<ref target="5-577-b"/>  that these things stood firm and established, which were but its false imaginations.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="299"><p> If then the throbbing fever of its

disease begins to abate, the embers of health will gradually kindle into a blaze and force it first to “proclaim its sin,” that is reproach itself, then come to the altar as a suppliant, beseeching grace with prayers and vows and sacrifices, by which alone it can obtain forgiveness.
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="300"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="45"/> Next we might reasonably inquire why

Moses speaks of the river of Egypt alone as having “lips” and refrains from doing so in the case of the Euphrates and other holy rivers. For while we have in one place “thou shalt stand meeting him on the lip of the river” (Ex. vii.</p></div>

may say scoffingly that such points should not be brought into our inquiries, as savouring of petty trifling rather than any profitable process.
