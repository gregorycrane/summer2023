<note n="6.143.a">This can hardly be right: though στρατηγία is sometimes
used in the civic sense of the praetorship, Philo is not likely
to have used so predominantly military a word where the civic
is in antithesis to the military. Two MSS. have δημαγωγίας,
but neither is this a very suitable word. What is wanted is
ἡγεμονίας, or its equivalent. See also App. p. 600.</note>



<note n="6.143.b">§§ 5–27 follow fairly closely the narrative of Gen. xxxvii.</note>


<note n="6.143.c">Literally “hating him as much as he was loved” (by his father).</note>




<note n="6.144.1">Most MSS. πρᾶγμα δηλούμενον which Cohn in his translation
adopted (taking it with διὰ συμβόλων). The order of
words seems to me to favour his earlier view.</note>



<note n="6.145.a">Or “fearing that he himself had made a mistake” (in setting store upon the dream).</note>





<note n="6.149.a">Or “a fine business you have embarked on.”</note>




<note n="6.151.a">Or “his life under the conditions which we have created.” But I should prefer to read as Mangey suggests τὸ καθ᾿ ἡμᾶς = “as far as we can do it.”</note>


<note n="6.151.b">See App. p. 600.</note>




<note n="6.152.1">MSS. τάφος.</note>



<note n="6.153.a"><hi rend="italic">Cf. De Abr.</hi> 257.</note>


<note n="6.153.b">Perhaps a somewhat distorted reminiscence of ἀνδρῶν
γὰρ ἐπιφανῶν πᾶσα γῆ τάφος Thuc. ii. 43.</note>




<note n="6.155.a">So LXX. E.V. “An officer of Pharaoh’s, the captain of
the guard.”</note>


<note n="6.155.b">The interpretation of Joseph as = “Addition” has appeared in <hi rend="italic">De Mut.</hi> 89 and <hi rend="italic">De Som.</hi> ii. 47 without any appendage. There, however, it is applied to adventitious wealth, luxuries and the like. Here the appendage “of a lord” helps Philo in the political interpretation which he gives. See further App. p. 600.</note>




<note n="6.157.a">This term for the Stoic ideal of the world conceived of as
a state and expressed in the name κοσμοπολίτης has been used
in <hi rend="italic">De Op.</hi> 19 and appears again in <hi rend="italic">Mos.</hi> ii. 51. It is not
quoted from any other writer than Philo in this sense. <hi rend="italic">Cf.</hi>
also μεγαλοπολίτης <hi rend="italic">De Op.</hi> 143.</note>


<note n="6.157.b">Gen. xxxvii. 3. Observe that the point has not been mentioned in the narrative.</note>




<note n="6.158.1">Unless ἀνέσεις etc. can represent processes rather than
symptoms, in which case we should have to change, as
Mangey suggested, αἰτίων into σιτίων, ταῦτα is quite illogical.
Cohn suggests πάντα or τὰ. The latter is adopted in the
translation.</note>


<note n="6.158.2">This τὸ εἶναι seems quite impossible and the reading of
some MSS. τοῦ εἷναι (“danger to existence”), though thought
possible by Cohn, does not commend itself. I suggest for</note>


<note n="6.159.a">consideration τὸ ἰέναι διὰ τοῦ κοινωφελοῦς (according to the common idiom of ἰέναι διά). “When the path of serving the commonweal involves danger,“ etc.</note>



<note n="6.159.a">Lit. “causes.”</note>




<note n="6.161.a">The false statement, as in <hi rend="italic">De Som.</hi> ii. 65, is treated as
true for the purposes of allegory. <hi rend="italic">Cf. De Mig.</hi> 21.</note>

<note n="6.163.a"><hi rend="italic">Cf.</hi> Deut. xxiii. 17. The passage hardly suggests this extreme interpretation, but Philo repeats it in <hi rend="italic">De Spec. Leg</hi>. iii. 51.</note>




<note n="6.164.1">So MSS.: Cohn τριττὸν. If τρίτον is kept the three μιάσματα
will be (1) harlotry, (2) adultery, (3) adultery with a master’s
wife. With τριττὸν they will presumably be (1) adultery,
(2) adultery with a mistress, (3) adultery with a master’s wife. But no stress is laid on any distinction between these two in the sequel.</note>




<note n="6.167.a">Or “with unchanged eyes.”</note>


<note n="6.167.b">See App. pp. 600–601.</note>




<note n="6.168.1">Not only awkward, but ungrammatical. It would be
simpler with Mangey to expunge τὴν ὑπ. than, as Wendland
suggests, to substitute τῆς ἐπιβουλῆς.</note>


<note n="6.168.2">MSS. ἀνάπλεως or -ων.</note>



<note n="6.169.a"> This is an unusual sense for ἀπερίσκεπτος which regularly means with Philo “reckless” or “inconsiderate.” It is possible, though less likely, that it may mean here “in his thoughtlessness,” <hi rend="italic">i.e</hi>. he did not consider what evidence he would leave behind him.</note>




<note n="6.171.a">Philo is no doubt thinking primarily of the Trojan War,
and it is not unlike him to magnify this into a plural. Still he can hardly have failed to have Antony and Cleopatra also in mind.</note>




<note n="6.173.a">See App. p. 601.</note>


<note n="6.173.b">Or “when you address . . . forget.”</note>




<note n="6.174.1">Cohn, who prints καὶ, notes “<hi rend="italic">excludendum videtur</hi>.” It
certainly seems pointless. If retained, it must mean that
the charges are disseminated in general as well as made
to the master in particular.</note>


<note n="6.174.2">Something is clearly lost; Mangey’s πάντα δρῶντα κατὰ
will make good sense.</note>


<note n="6.174.3">Here, too, Cohn indicates a lacuna and suggests δράσω or χρηματιῶ It does not seem to me necessary. It is not difficult to understand ἔμαθον καὶ ἐπιτηδεύσω. To understand an affirmative out of a negative is a looseness which may be found in good writers. A good example occurs in the opening lines of Horace’s <hi rend="italic">Satires</hi>.</note>




<note n="6.176.1">So Mangey: most MSS. ἀφειμένον, which Cohn retains,
others -ων. The masculine seems to me necessary for the sense.</note>




<note n="6.179.a"> The first line is from Eur. <hi rend="italic">Phoenissae</hi> 521. The others also from Eur. Quoted <hi rend="italic">Leg. All</hi>. iii. 202 and <hi rend="italic">Quod Probus</hi> 99, where the speaker is given as Heracles.</note>




<note n="6.181.a"> For §§ 80–124 see Gen. xxxix. 20–xli. 45.</note>






<note n="6.187.a">ὅσιον here in the sense of what is demanded by religion.</note>







<note n="6.195.a">For this regular use of ὑπηχεῖν in Philo for a voice heard
inwardly see note on <hi rend="italic">De Som.</hi> i. 164.</note>


<note n="6.195.b">Or “country districts”; cf. the common use of the word
for farms or estates.</note>


<note n="6.195.c">There is no authority for this statement in Genesis, or the
arguments adduced for it. But Philo may well have heard
or read of precedents.</note>


<note n="6.195.d">i.e. when we thresh the annual allowance from the store we copy what we do in the ordinary harvest and therefore are reminded of it. But Cohn in his translation adopts Mangey’s ὑπόμνησις.</note>


<note n="6.195.e">Lit. “which has been calculated.”</note>

<note n="6.205.b">i.e. of Alexander.</note>





<note n="6.208.1">The two lists balance so closely that one may be tempted
to make the balance complete, and Cohn suggests the omission
of τὸ ἀνωφελές at the beginning of the second and the
insertion of τὸ φιλάνθρωπον. The argument does not seem
to me convincing. Perhaps, too, φιλόθεον rather than φιλάνθρωπον
is the reverse of Philo’s φίλαυτον. <hi rend="italic">Cf. Quod
Det.</hi> 32.</note>


<note n="6.208.2">The transition to a totally different kind of question seems a little abrupt. It may be observed that what we might expect, viz. ἄλλα οἷον would very easily be lost before ἀλλότριον.</note>



<note n="6.209.a"> Or perhaps better “self-assertive.”</note>


<note n="6.209.b">“set on bread” in contrast to the more elaborate preparations of Gen. xviii. He apparently forgets that the steward had been ordered to provide a sumptuous meal (§ 196).</note>





<note n="6.213.a">The incidents of Joseph’s exaltation discussed in these sections are treated somewhat differently in <hi rend="italic">De Som</hi>. ii. 43–47.</note>





<note n="6.216.1">Cohn would read διάκρισιν, but <hi rend="italic">cf. De Mig.</hi> 19 τὰς ἀληθεῖς
καὶ σαφεῖς τῶν πραγμάτων συγκρίσεις (referring also to Joseph’s
dreams) εἶναι κατὰ θεόν.</note>


<note n="6.216.2">Perhaps read τοπάρχων, the word used (in the form
τοπάρχης) in Gen. xli. 34.</note>



<note n="6.217.a">From this point on to § 257 Philo’s narrative follows Gen. xli. 46–xlvii. 12 without serious interruption.</note>


<note n="6.217.b">The name regularly given to the districts of Egypt. See L. &amp; S.</note>




<note n="6.219.a">Philo is probably thinking of Gen. xlii. 9 “Joseph remembered the dreams which he dreamed of them, and said unto them, Ye are spies.”</note>





<note n="6.223.a">Or “with consummate acting.” See App. p. 602.</note>




<note n="6.225.a">Gen. xlii. 23 “they knew not that Joseph understood, for
there was an interpreter between them.” By missing out
the first half of this Philo obscures the point. Presumably
he means the same as Genesis, viz. that they ventured on this quiet conversation, because they supposed that he would not understand them in the absence of the interpreter, who had acted before.</note>




<note n="6.226.1">My correction: MSS. and Cohn καὶ. Mangey ἂν ἐφείλκετο
for συνεφείλκετο.</note>




<note n="6.229.a">More literally “from different sides,” or perhaps “taking
hold of different parts.”</note>




<note n="6.230.1">The ungrammatical genitives should perhaps be corrected
to nominatives.</note>


<note n="6.230.2">MSS. οἴκαδε.</note>




<note n="6.232.1">ἀγνοεῖν in this sense is strange: Cohn suggests ἀποκνεῖν,
Mangey (better) ἀμφιγνοεῖν: I would also suggest as nearer to the MSS. ἃ ἐνόει, “what was in his mind.” The λέγοντος is anacoluthic in any case.</note>





<note n="6.237.a">Perhaps based on Gen. xliii. 32 “they set on for him by
himself, and them by themselves, and for the Egyptians by
themselves.”</note>




<note n="6.239.a">See Gen. xliii. 33, where the statement that they were
placed in order of seniority is followed by “the men marvelled
one with another.”</note>


<note n="6.239.b">Philo may have found a ground for this in the phrase</note>







<note n="6.246.1">MSS. ἐπ᾿ αὐτῷ.</note>


<note n="6.246.2">So Cohn and Mangey with some MSS. authority. Most
MSS. have προσηλύτους or προσβλήτους. See note <hi rend="italic">a.</hi></note>



<note n="6.247.a">Assuming that προβλήτους is to be read, its place in the
series as a “servile name,” followed by οἰκότριβας and ἀργυρωνήτους,
suggests that it also describes a special type of
slave. If so, it may perhaps refer to children who had been
exposed in infancy and then annexed by persons who
brought them up as their own slaves. Thus they would naturally form a third class to οἰκότριβας (taken as = οἰκογένεις and ἀργυρωνήτους. I have not been able to find in Greek or Roman legislation any allusion to such a status, but see App. p. 602.</note>


<note n="6.247.b">Or perhaps “dignified,” “impressive,” <hi rend="italic">cf. De Abr</hi>. 210. Possibly, as Mangey suggested, read βαθυτέρῳ <hi rend="italic">cf</hi>. § 168 above.</note>


<note n="6.247.c">Lit. “in front of the city.”</note>




<note n="6.248.1">The singular seems strange. Mangey wished to correct
either to τὴν &lt;ἱδίαν&gt; πόλιν or τὰς πόλεις. The latter is accepted by Cohn in a similar passage in <hi rend="italic">De Decal</hi>. 13, where the MSS. have κατὰ πόλιν. (The absence of the article perhaps makes a difference, and κατὰ πόλιν might be read in both passages.)</note>



<note n="6.249.a">Cohn translates “einheimischen,” which would seem to represent Mangey’s τὴν ἰδίαν πόλιν (see critical note).</note>




<note n="6.250.1">MSS. λήψη.</note>




<note n="6.252.1">Cohn and Mangey’s punctuation seems to me faulty in
this sentence. They place full stops after ἀπαλλαγῆναι and
φθόνος (Mangey also after ἀνῄρηται). But surely it is all one
sentence introduced by διὰ τοῦτο and stating that all these
steps were taken as a test.</note>



<note n="6.253.a">Benjamin’s “mess” was five times as much as any of theirs, Gen. xliii. 34. Philo has rather strangely omitted
to mention this in his account of the feast. Josephus, <hi rend="italic">Ant.</hi>
ii. 125, gives the same reason for the action.</note>




<note n="6.254.1">MSS. συμβόλοις.</note>





<note n="6.259.a">§§ 246–249 have no basis in Genesis. The nearest corresponding
text is xlv. 15 “and after that his brethren talked with him.” Did Philo read or think he read περὶ for πρὸς αὐτόν?</note>




<note n="6.261.a">Lit. “the last thing at any rate,” i.e. the extreme of
clemency which could be expected. Cohn takes it with
λιμώττουσι—“in the extremity of famine.” The position of
γοῦν seems to me to be against this. Mangey <hi rend="italic">postea certe,</hi>
presumably meaning “at the conclusion of the interview.”</note>




<note n="6.262.1">My insertion. The sentence evidently needs correction,
which Cohn would make by expunging ἐπιτίθενται.</note>


<note n="6.262.2">Most MSS. συνεξεληλυθότων or ἐξ-, one ἐξεληλυθότος.</note>


<note n="6.262.3">So MSS., Cohn, and Mangey; but? ἀπέχοντι.</note>



<note n="6.263.a">Gen. xlvi. 4 “and Joseph shall put his hands upon thine eyes.” Did Philo fail to understand this phrase, which does not occur again in the LXX? The idea of closing the eyes of the dead, otherwise expressed, was of course familiar to him in the classics, cf. § 23 above.</note>




<note n="6.265.a">So LXX. E.V. Goshen.</note>


<note n="6.265.b">§§ 258-260 are a very free version of Gen. xlvii. 13-26.
Joseph’s honesty is deduced from verse 14 “Joseph brought all the money into Pharaoh’s house.” Philo omits the stages by which the property and land of the Egyptians passed into the king’s hand, and the tax of one-fifth of the produce imposed upon them. That the gift of seed was only made in the seventh year of the famine might be fairly inferred from the LXX. in verse 24 “and the land shall have its produce” (ἔσται δὲ γεννήματα αὐτῆς) The appointment of overseers has no parallel in Genesis.</note>

<note n="6.269.c">So LXX. (Gen. 1. 19). E.V. “Am I in the place of God (to punish you)?” Philo has made use of the text in the same sense <hi rend="italic">De Mig</hi>. 22 and 160, <hi rend="italic">De Som</hi>. ii. 107.</note>
