<note n="3.31.a">“The word φαντασία, ‘appearance’ or ‘appearing,’ is
a technical term in Stoic logic for which no one English
equivalent is as yet unanimously adopted. It denotes the
immediate datum of consciousness or experience, whether
presented to the sense or in certain cases to the mind. Hence ‘presentation’ is nearer than ‘perception’ or ‘impression’ (Hicks on Diog. Laert. vii. 43; Loeb translation, vol. ii. p. 152).</note>

<note n="3.55.a">The translation follows Mangey in omitting τῶν before
εἰς τὸ δοκεῖν ὠφελεῖν. This, however, is not quite satisfactory,
as εἰς τὸ δοκεῖν would naturally mean “as regards semblance.”
Perhaps retain τῶν and for ὠφελεῖν substitute ὠφελίμων.</note>


<note n="3.55.b">Literally “fostering the head’s hair as long locks.”
In the allegory the “head’s hair” becomes the “growths of
truths,” which are of the nature of heads or leading principles,
and since κομᾶν, “to wear long hair,” also means “to
be proud,” κόμη is interpreted as the pride which we should
feel in virtue. For further elucidation see App. p. 487.</note>


<note n="3.55.c">In the original no doubt this means that as contact with the corpse cancels the vow, the days before the defilement must not be reckoned as part of the necessary period, and indeed Philo’s Greek might be translated as “the days before the defection”; but the argument requires that the words should be taken as in the translation.</note>
