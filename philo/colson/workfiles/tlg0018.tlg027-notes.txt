<note n="9.11.c">See Diog. Laert. viii. 17, where this occurs in a list of allegorical watchwords or precepts (σύμβολα) put forth by Pythagoras, others being “Don’t stir a fire with a knife,” “Don’t eat your heart,” and “Don’t keep birds with crooked claws.” Diogenes Laertius explains a few of them. On the exact form of the one quoted here see App. p. 509.</note>

<note n="9.12.1">The text here is uncertain. All MSS. except M have
κρατούντων or ἐπικρατούντων after ἀκτίνων. But ἀκτίς is
always feminine. Cohn follows M in the main, but does not
give any satisfactory account of the presence of κρατούντων
in the others.</note>



<note n="9.13.a">ἰδέα here in the Platonic sense equivalent to νοητὸν φῶς
below.</note>


<note n="9.13.b">This section is clearly a reminiscence of the opening of
Plato, <hi rend="italic">Rep.</hi> vii. 514 ff. where mankind are compared to
prisoners chained in a cave with their backs to a fire and
unable to see more than the shadows cast by the passers-by,
who even if released will be so dazzled by the daylight that
they will still believe that the shadows are the reality.</note>


<note n="9.13.c">So Plato 515 c διὰ τὰς μαρμαρυγὰς ἀδυνατοῖ καθορᾶν
ἐκεῖνα ὧν τότε τὰς σκιὰς ἑώρα.</note>


<note n="9.13.d">Philo is perhaps thinking of <hi rend="italic">ibid.</hi> 514 B ὥσπερ τοῖς θαυματοποιοῖς πρὸ τῶν ἀνθρώπων πρόκειται τὰ παραφράγματα, ὑπὲρ ὧν τὰ θαύματα δεικνύασιν. But see App. p. 509.</note>


<note n="9.13.e">While the sense requires beyond all question that the next four sections represent the views of the unphilosophical common man and in particular explain the word θαύματα (“puppet show” or “conjurer’s trick”) as applied just above to the paradoxes of the philosophers, it seems strange to find no word to indicate this. And anyone who reads the translations of Yonge or Mangey, where no such word is inserted, naturally starts off by taking these sections to be Philo’s opinion, until he realizes that they will make hopeless nonsense. It is possible that φασί or some such word has fallen out, but not necessary. A somewhat similar air of approbation in stating opinions which are finally condemned may be found in <hi rend="italic">Spec. Leg,</hi> i. 335–338.</note>




<note n="9.15.a">The paradox of good man citizen <hi rend="italic">v.</hi> bad man exile does
not seem to be quoted so often as some of the others, and the
only examples cited by Arnim are from Philo himself, <hi rend="italic">e.g.
Leg. All.</hi> iii. 1. But cf. Cicero, <hi rend="italic">Acad. Pri.</hi> ii. 136 Sapientem

exsules.</note>


<note n="9.15.b">Lit. “I know not.” This use of the 1st person sing. in a
statement of other people’s opinions seems strange, but is
paralleled in <hi rend="italic">De Aet.</hi> 119, and <hi rend="italic">Flacc.</hi> 50.</note>


<note n="9.15.c">The paradox good man rich <hi rend="italic">v</hi>. bad man poor is very common, see examples in <hi rend="italic">S.V.F.</hi> iii. 589–603. Philo’s constant insistence on the contrast between blind wealth and seeing wealth is substantially the same.</note>

“clear-voiced”). I feel considerable doubt as to whether M
is right. The quotation which follows as well as the phrase
ποτίμων λόγων comes from the myth in the <hi rend="italic">Phaedrus</hi> which
Socrates introduces with an appeal to the Muses as λίγειαι
(237 MSS.), and λιγυρός has been used earlier, 230 MSS., in describing
the scene of the dialogue.</note>



<note n="9.17.a">See App. p. 510.</note>


<note n="9.17.b"><hi rend="italic">Phaedrus</hi> 247 A. Quoted also with βαίνει for ἵσταται <hi rend="italic">Spec. Leg.</hi> ii. 249, and with many echoes elsewhere. See note on <hi rend="italic">De Fuga</hi> 62 (vol. v. pp. 583 f.).</note>

<note n="9.18.1">On the hiatus παιδείᾳ ἀναθεῖναι see App. p. 510.</note>



<note n="9.19.a">See App. p. 511. no moral issues are involved. It is an accident which does not tell us anything about character or conduct.</note>


<note n="9.19.b">The meaning presumably is that ἐλευθερία in the literal
sense cannot be the subject of a philosophical ζήτημα because</note>




<note n="9.20.1">Perhaps read Ζεὺς, see note α.</note>



<note n="9.21.a">This line is quoted in Arist. <hi rend="italic">Eth. Eud.</hi> 1242 a 37 with
Ζεύς for θεός, as the anapaestic metre requires, and is paraphrased
by Ambrose “Jupiter mihi praeest, nullus autem
hominum.” As Ambros is not likely to have known the line from any other source, there is certainly some reason to suppose that he found Ζεὺς in his text of Philo.</note>


<note n="9.21.b"><hi rend="italic">Cf.</hi> Diog. Laert. vii. 122 οὐ μόνον δὲ ἐλευθέρους εἶναι τοὺς σοφοὺς ἀλλὰ καὶ βασιλέας. This is probably the most common of the paradoxes, and is given by Philo several times, <hi rend="italic">e.g. De Mut.</hi> 15.2 (vol. v. p. 591), where see note.</note>




<note n="9.23.a">Quoted also by Plut. <hi rend="italic">De Poet. Aud.</hi> 13 as from Euripides.
Plutarch makes the same point as Philo, that it applies to
other seeming evils besides death.</note>




<note n="9.24.1">Perhaps read παντί τῳ, a common phrase in Philo, or
παντὰ τῷ. The stress seems to be on resistance to improper
orders, rather than to the person who makes them.</note>



<note n="9.25.a">See on § 99.</note>


<note n="9.25.b">Or “elasticity”—or perhaps “with the well-knit frame
of the true athlete.” That is to say I conceive the word to
be used in the semi-physical Stoic sense of the force or current which holds bodies together and is otherwise known as ἕξις. Thus “walking” is said by Seneca to be a “spiritus a principali
usque ad pedes permissus” (Arnold, <hi rend="italic">Roman Stoicism</hi>, pp. 89, 250). See on ἕξεως πνευματικῆς (<hi rend="italic">De Aet.</hi> 86). It can hardly here mean “athletic spirit” in the sense that we use the phrase, nor yet the “good wind” of the athlete, though Leisegang perhaps took it so, when he couples this passage with <hi rend="italic">Leg. All.</hi> iii. 14 ἀθλητοῦ τρόπον διαπνέοντος καὶ συλλεγομένου τὸ πνεῦμα</note>




<note n="9.26.1">See note α. The correction προσπεπονθόσιν ἀρετῇ is possible,
particularly as M has ἀρετῆ (=-ῇ) =“denoted to virtue.”
I suggest for consideration πεποιθόσιν ἀρετῇ or πεποθηκόσιν
ἀρετὴν.</note>


<note n="9.26.2">Cohn punctuates with a colon after λεγόμενον, and
comma after εἰδόσι, thus making the case of the pancratiast
to be the subject of γέγονε instead of the moral victory of the
ἀστεῖος.</note>


<note n="9.26.3">On the insertion of οὕτως see App. p. 511.</note>



<note n="9.27.a">i.e. in themselves, but πάσχειν ἀρετήν in this sense, or even in the sense of having experience of virtue in others is more than doubtful Greek. No satisfactory emendation however has been proposed. See note 1.</note>


<note n="9.27.b">Zeller, <hi rend="italic">Socrates</hi> (Eng. trans.), p. 334 takes the saying to mean that the virtuous man is hard to bear or makes himself a nuisance by telling unpleasant truths and quotes in support other similar sayings of the Cynics. Philo takes it in a quite different sense, though the last words of § 31 suggest something
of the thought which Zeller assigns to it.</note>


<note n="9.27.c">Ex. xvii. 12. The same interpretation is given with some additions in <hi rend="italic">Leg. All.</hi> iii. 45.</note>


<note n="9.27.d"><hi rend="italic">e.g. Il.</hi> ii. 243.</note>




<note n="9.29.a">§§ 32–40. These sections, except in § 40, where the
casual illustration from the lions leads Philo to revert to his
main theme, do not seem to bear upon the argument that the
good man alone is free. They may perhaps be regarded as
arguing that, independently of the main philosophical contention,
the common tests of slavery and freedom are not
consistently held. So with ὑπηρεσίαι, which as Cohn points
out has been stated in § 23 to be the ordinary test, no one calls the soldier a slave, nor yet that other soldier, the freeman driven by poverty to do menial tasks. On the other hand (§ 34) persons who are admittedly slaves in the ordinary sense have functions which are not ὑπηρεσίαι. A second test (obedience) begins in § 36. This breaks down because children and pupils obey but are not slaves; a third test, purchase (§ 37), because ransomed captives are not slaves, and purchase also does not prevent the complete subjection of the purchaser to the purchased (§§ 38–39).</note>




<note n="9.30.1">MSS. ὑφηγῶνται or ἀφηγοῦνται.</note>



<note n="9.31.a">Stephanus says of παρατρέφεσθαι “Plutarchus dicitur
usurpasse de pauperibus qui misere aluntur,” but no examples
are quoted, and the words may simply mean “get their
rations,” the point of the prefix being that like slaves they
are dependent on others.</note>


<note n="9.31.b">This may be taken in two ways, (1) as in the translation
with what follows: the parents’ interests are identical with
those of the children, and they cannot wish them to be slaves; (2) taking it with the previous sentence, no one who acts voluntarily is a slave, and the children do act voluntarily.</note>


<note n="9.31.c">Perhaps “sold cheap” as apparently in § 121. On the other hand neither here nor in <hi rend="italic">Flaccus</hi> 132 is there much point in cheapness. See my note on <hi rend="italic">De Cher.</hi> 123, vol. ii. p. 486, where it is suggested that the word merely conveys some measure of contempt like our “peddling.”</note>




<note n="9.33.a">εἰ μὴ refers back to § 37. Philo is no doubt thinking of the story told of Diogenes (Diog. Laert. vi. 75): when his friends offered to ransom him from the pirates, he refused, “for lions are not slaves of those who keep them, but they are the slaves of the lions. For fear is the mark of the slave, but wild beasts make men fear them.”</note>




<note n="9.34.1">“Suspectum propter hiatum,” says Cohn. See App.

<note n="9.34.2">MSS. ἀλήθειαν.</note>


<note n="9.34.3">So MSS. Cohn τῶν θεῶν calling attention to the plural

I think, a common phenomenon in Stoicism. There is also
the hiatus; see again App. p. 510.</note>


<note n="9.34.4">MSS.συνομολογεῖν.</note>



<note n="9.35.a">See on § 128.</note>


<note n="9.35.b">No poetical reference is quoted either for the thought or the language, and I understand the reference to be to the word πανάρχων, which is not cited from elsewhere.</note>


<note n="9.35.c">By “naked philosophy” he perhaps means “frank” or “outspoken.” <hi rend="italic">Cf.</hi> γυμνοῖς ἤθεσι προσαγορεύοντες “their manner of address was
unreserved” <hi rend="italic">De Abr.</hi> 117, and γυμνοῖς ὀνόμασι <hi rend="italic">Spec. Leg.</hi> ii. 131. But this
does not quite account for ὡς λόγος, and still less does the γνησίας which Mangey proposed. Possibly there may be some allusion to the gymnosophists (see § 93), but more probably to something which we cannot now recover.</note>

<note n="9.39.a">The source of these two quotations is unknown. The
second is quoted by Marcus Aurelius xi. 80.</note>


<note n="9.39.b"><p>The point of the words “some . . . free” is obscure
both here and below and their expunction has been suggested.
I think they are defensible here, but not below, where I suggest
that they may have been inserted in mistaken analogy.
The argument, as I understand it, is, ἰσηγορία between
persons implies that they are of the same status, both free or both slaves. All good men, being proficient in the laws or art of conduct, have ἰσηγ. with each other, therefore they are all either free or slaves. And as no one denies that some good men are free, they must all be free.</p>
<p>
The negative argument is, the bad man, being unproficient in the said laws or art, has no ἰσηγ. with the proficient, and as all free men have ἰσηγ. with each other the bad cannot be free. I do not see how one can fit “some of the good are free” into this.</p></note>




<note n="9.41.a">Cohn and Arnim in <hi rend="italic">S.V.F.</hi> i. 228 take this sentence as
part of the quotation from Zeno. It seems to me better to
take it as Philo’s inference from Zeno’s dictum. To include
it in Zeno’s words would imply that he made a point of ἰσηγορία, and one might expect to hear more of it, but the term does not appear elsewhere in <hi rend="italic">S. V.F.</hi> Also § 54 deals entirely with Zeno’s question and not with the inference drawn from it.</note>


<note n="9.41.b">Or perhaps “the argument,” see note on <hi rend="italic">De Aet,</hi> 143.</note>




<note n="9.43.a">Gen. xxvii. 40 “Thou shalt serve (δουλεύσεις) thy
brother.” <hi rend="italic">Cf. De Cong.</hi> 176. For the idea that Zeno drew
from Moses cf. the ascription of Heracleitus’s doctrine of the
opposites to him, <hi rend="italic">Quis Rerum</hi> 214.</note>


<note n="9.43.b">The word perhaps carries on the idea of medical treat- ment, i.e. ointment or liniment, but more probably, as suggested
by πληττόμενοι, friction, “rubbing it in.”</note>




<note n="9.44.1">Perhaps ἀνθρώποις (written ἀνοις) δὲ, see note α.σ</note>



<note n="9.45.a">Literally “things in which there are actions are righteous
actions,” etc., which is hardly sense. Arnim’s correction to
ἀνθρώποις δὲ (see note 1) is very probable.</note>


<note n="9.45.b">Philo cannot of course mean “that he does not do indifferent
actions,” and we must understand βιασθέντα πράττειν. Ambrose’s paraphrase
“indifferentibus ita non movetur ut nullis momentis . . . inclinetur” looks as if he read something else (? εἰκῆ).</note>




<note n="9.47.a">Lit. “set forth the general appearances of things,” meaning
I suppose the impressions they produce as a whole when
we do not examine them in detail.</note>


<note n="9.47.b">ἀναπιμπλάντες perhaps has the common meaning of “infect,”
though here used in a good sense. <hi rend="italic">Cf. De Prov.</hi> 71.</note>


<note n="9.47.c">For this thought of the rarity and retiring nature of the good <hi rend="italic">cf. De Mut.</hi> 34–38, where it is associated with the text “Enoch was not found.”</note>




<note n="9.48.1">So one MS. (S). The others either omit or have περιρ- ρεομένους which seems quite impossible, but the middle in the sense of “overflow” has no examples quoted.</note>



<note n="9.49.a">Mangey translates “numquid pretiosum adhuc fugiens sensum ibi reponatur.” But this, which is certainly simpler, would require the omission of τῶν.</note>




<note n="9.51.a">The whole section is founded on Deut. xxx. 11–14, part of which is actually quoted, a passage often used by Philo, <hi rend="italic">e.g. De Virt.</hi> 183, and with the same interpretation of <hi rend="italic">v.</hi> 14.</note>


<note n="9.51.b">See App. p. 511.</note>




<note n="9.52.1">So one MS. (F). Of the others three have πρεσβευταὶ
λόγων ἔργων, three πρεσβευταὶ λόγων ἔργω, and one (M) προσέταξε
λόγων ἔργα. The characteristic common to these
seven is the omission of καὶ after λόγων. I suggest with considerable
confidence ἐν ᾗ πρεσβεύεται λόγων ἔργα “in which
deeds are held in higher esteem than words.” The use of
πρεσβεύομαι with the genitive is quoted from Plato, <hi rend="italic">Legg.</hi>
879 MS. and need cause no difficulty, though πρεσβεύω is
perhaps more common. I submit that it is quite supported
by what Philo goes on to say of the “barbarians.” The Magi
search into the words of nature καθ᾿ ἡσυχίαν. The Essenes
(<hi rend="italic">cf. De Vit. Cont.</hi> 1) representing the practical life, avoid the
περιεργία Ἑλληνικῶν ὀνομάτων, § 88, and the gymnosophists,
as exemplified by Calanus, do not practise λόγους εἰς πανήγυριν,
§ 96. See also App. p. 513.</note>



<note n="9.53.a">a So too in <hi rend="italic">De Mut.</hi> 35–37, though some say that σοφία and ὁ σοφός are ἀνύπαρκτος, the conclusion is that each of them is

<note n="9.53.b">“Appropriate,” because ἑπτά is supposed to be derived from σεμνός and σεβασμός, <hi rend="italic">cf. De Op.</hi> 127. But see App. p. 512.</note>


<note n="9.53.c">This translation of the only translatable reading found in any one <hi rend="italic">ms</hi>. is given in despair, for I do not believe that “ambassadors of words and deeds” is a possible expression. Cohn, <hi rend="italic">Hermes,</hi> 1916, p. 174, thinks that πρεσβευταί here = “cultores.”
But no example for such a sense of the noun is cited. For what I believe to be the true reading see note 1.</note>

<note n="9.57.a">The triple division of philosophy has been frequently

the exact meaning is somewhat uncertain.</note>


<note n="9.59.b">i.e. ceremonial purity and avoidance of defilement.
So rather than general purity of life, which would come
under τὸ φιλάρετον. For this use of ἁγνεία cf. Plato, <hi rend="italic">Legg.</hi> 917 B καθαρότητός τε καὶ ἁγνείας τὰ περὶ τοὺς θεούς. Though this kind of purity is not mentioned elsewhere in this narrative, it is in other accounts, see App. p. 514.</note>




<note n="9.61.a">γνήσιος is here used of children, not as usual in antithesis

So too in <hi rend="italic">Legatio</hi> 62, 71, the behaviour of a father-in-law to

<note n="9.64.2">M has βραχεῖς ἄλλην. The evidently defective text of
this sentence must be judged in the light of Ambrose’s paraphrase.
Ambrose, whose version of the letter in <hi rend="italic">Ep.</hi> 37 is
very close till the end, closes with “nobis res sociae verbis
et verba rebus: res celeres et sermones breves: in virtute
nobis libertas beata est.” From this Cohn suggests after
ἔργοις λόγοι, &lt;ἔργα μὲν ταχέα καὶ λόγοι&gt; βραχεῖς, ἀλλ᾿ ἔχουσι
δύναμιν, κτλ. The difficulty I find in this is that it ignores last is read by two MSS. for περιποιοῦντες). The similar
ending of δύναμιν and ἡμῖν would facilitate the loss of ἀρεταὶ
ἡμῖν. At the same time it is true that the βραχεῖς of M fits
better with Ambrose’s “breves.” See also App. p. 516. Ambrose’s “in virtute.” I tentatively suggest and have translated &lt;ἔργα μέν ταχέα καὶ λόγοι&gt; βραχεῖαν ἔχουσι δύναμιν· &lt;ἀρεταὶ ἡμῖν&gt; καὶ μακαριότητα καὶ ἐλευθερίαν περιποιοῦνται

<note n="9.67.a">Or if Cohn’s reconstruction (see note 2, pp. 64–66) is pre- ferred, “Our deeds are swift and our words short; but they have power, securing for us blessedness and freedom.” For the suggested reconstruction translated above see same note.</note>


<note n="9.67.b">This is the fourth time that this passage is quoted by Philo, the other three being <hi rend="italic">Leg. All</hi> iii. 202, <hi rend="italic">De Ios.</hi> 78, and § 25 above. On the source of the quotation see App. p. 516.</note>




<note n="9.68.1">MSS. τὸ εἶδος αὐτοῦ οὐ (or οὗ). Cohn prints the last two
words as above, but leaves the equally unmetrical τὸ
εἶδος though he expresses high approval of the correction
(Elmsley’s) to τό γ᾿.</note>



<note n="9.69.a">This passage from a Satyric drama of Euripides evidently gives a different version from that in Apollodorus ii. 6. 2, in which Heracles having murdered Iphitus has to expiate his crime by three years servitude and accordingly is sold by Hermes to Omphale. During this servitude he kills Syleus, who used to compel strangers to dig in his vineyard. See further App. p. 516.</note>

does not appear to be referred to elsewhere. Of the re- partees in § 123 the first is given in Diogenes Laertius vi. 29 and in another setting <hi rend="italic">ibid.</hi> 74. The second repartee seems to be another form of that recorded in Diogenes Laertius vi. 74, where speaking of a certain Xeniades (elsewhere described as a profligate), he said to the auctioneer “sell me to him, for he needs a master.”</note>




<note n="9.80.1">So Cohn with M. The other MSS. vary between οὐ λυπουμένου
ὄντος, οὐ μόνον λυπουμένου ὄντος and οὐ μόνον λυπουμένου.
Cohn’s theory that the first form of these arose by mistaking
the χ of οὐχ for λ, and that the others were later developed
out of it, is probably right.</note>


<note n="9.80.2">Cohn, who prints ἐφ᾿ ᾗ for ἐφ᾿ οἷς, regards the passage or
at least ἐκεχειρίας to be corrupt. I do not feel sure of this.
The word is used coupled with ἄδεια and ἄνεσις in <hi rend="italic">De Cher.</hi>

where see note, we have ἡ τοῦ διαμαρτάνειν ἐκεχειρία. The
extension of the word from a situation where restraint is
removed to unrestrainedness as a quality in a man is not
great. It would be difficult however to fit it in with ἐφ᾿ ᾗ,
unless it meant that the others were firightened at his cheeki- ness, and I have adopted ἐφ᾿ οἷς (M) which has at least as good authority. We might expect τὰ ἐφ᾿ οἷς but compare τῇ καθ᾿ ὧν γράφεται δυνάμει, § 104. The most questionable thing about the interpretation which I have given is that it assumes that the middle ἐτράπετο can be used transitively, and though τρέπειν and τρέπεσθαι are in some ways interchangeable, I have not found any exact parallel.</note>

<note n="9.83.a">This phrase is difficult. The sense given to δίχα in the
translation, by which “without” is extended to mean “not subject to,” s not natural, δίχα is often used by Philo to introduce some additional statement and possibly that may be the meaning here, i.e. “not to say absolute sovereignty,”
referring of course to the sovereignty of the sage described by Diogenes Laertius vii. 122 as ἀρχὴ ἀνυπεύθυνος. The natural translation “freedom but not irresponsible sovereignty” (so Mangey “nudam libertatem imperio pleno destitutam”) seems impossibly pointless.</note>

<note n="9.84.1">Cohn and Mangey are no doubt right in expunging the
negative. For though it would make sense as “I was not
banished, but removed by divine agency” (see end of § 130),
the comparison with Heracles who was ejected and the
versions of the story given by Diogenes Laertius ii. 102 and
Plutarch (<hi rend="italic">De Exil.</hi> 16), both of whom make him answer the
question “Were you banished?” in the affirmative, show that
οὐκ should be omitted.</note>


<note n="9.84.2">So three MSS. The others Ἀθήνας, which Cohn prints.
Whether he intended to insert ἢ and omitted it by inadvertence
I do not know. As it stands, it seems to me quite
impossible.</note>

The general meaning of πλήρωμα as a nautical term is “the crew, i.e. not a dead-weight, but the human “complement” as in § 142, but this does not suit the context here, and not very well in § 41, and as the two passages cannot be dissociated, it seems better to assume that in both cases the meaning is “freight” or “cargo.”</note>

<note n="9.89.a">§§ 137–143. In these sections Philo seems to abandon
his theory and to accept the common conception of freedom
and slavery. The slavery which the generals declare to be
the worst of evils, which incapacitated for admission to the
religious functions at Athens, and for sevice in the <hi rend="italic">Argo,</hi>
is according to the doctrine which the treatise preaches not
slavery to the wise. It may perhaps be said that if freedom
is admitted to be exellent, freedom in the philosophical sense is still more excellent—that the exclusion of slaves in the ordinary sense from the Athenian celebrations and from the <hi rend="italic">Argo</hi> did incidentally teach the lesson that the “free” might carry out menial duties without loss of true freedom. But those ideas are only just hinted at. The real argument is resumed in § 144.</note>




<note n="9.91.a">According to Cohn, Demeter and Persephone, but see
App. p. 517.</note>


<note n="9.91.b">Part of four lines quoted by Stobaeus from the <hi rend="italic">Auge</hi> of Euripides.</note>




<note n="9.92.1">MSS. αὔδασαι or αὔδασε or (M) δαπ<hi rend="sup">σ</hi>έν
(<hi rend="italic">sic.</hi>) For the suggestion
αὐδῆεν see note <hi rend="italic">a</hi>.</note>



<note n="9.93.a">This refers to the legend that Athena fitted into the prow
of the <hi rend="italic">Argo</hi> a speaking (φωνῆεν) timber from the oak at
Dodona. See Apollodorus i. 9. 19 who mentions two of its
utterances, one being the complaint that Heracles overloaded
it referred to in § 128. The quotation from Aeschylus, at any
rate as punctuated by Cohn and translated above, does not
seem very apposite. As αὔδασον has no MS. authority (see
note 1), the correction αὐδῆεν or αὐδᾶεν seems probable unless Nauck’s objection that the word would not be used in iambics precludes it. If αὔδασον is retained I should prefer to translate “Where is it (or he)? Speak, holy bark of <hi rend="italic">Argo</hi>.”</note>


<note n="9.93.b">Or “very wittily” or “very good-naturedly.” I have discussed the meaning of this phrase in a note on <hi rend="italic">De Ios.</hi> 168, vol. vi. p. 602. Antigenidas was a famous Theban musician, about the beginning of the fourth century MS.</note>


<note n="9.93.c">Perhaps a reminiscence of the line by an unknown author
<quote>
<l>τῷ γὰρ καλῶς πράσσοντι πᾶσα γῆ πατρίς,</l>
</quote>

though the meaning of this is not what is intended here.</note>


<note n="9.93.d">A fragment of Euripides (lyrical, whence the form βιοτά for -ή), and continuing σώφρονος τραπέζης.</note>




<note n="9.95.a">That this section makes impossible nonsense here is
obvious. Massebieau propounded the theory that §§ 32–40
should be transferred to after § 146 and followed by § 147.
While the relevance of §§ 32–40 as it stands is not very
clear, it seems to me they would be still more intrusive here.
And what connexion has § 147 with § 40? In § 40 lions are
said to be really the masters of their owners and the moral
deduced is that still more is the wise man master in the true sense. To follow by a warning against buying lions would be utterly inept. By what accident it got inserted here, it is useless guessing. But probably it belongs to some disquisition in which harbouring passions is compared to keeping wild beasts (<hi rend="italic">cf. De Praem.</hi> 88). Such a disquisition might well have found a place in the twin treatise “that every fool is a slave.”</note>




<note n="9.97.a">The argument seems to be “bodily immunity may put
the philosophical slave on an equal footing, but only spiritual
freedom would give the superiority in discussion.” It would
be clearer if πόσῳ μᾶλλον ἐλευθεροστομήσει ὁ σοφὸς (a suggestion
mentioned by Cohn) was inserted before εἰ μὴ, but it is
not necessary.</note>


<note n="9.97.b">φρονήσεως has not been questioned, but seems to me hardly possible, at any rate if τοῖς ἄλλοις is retained. What is wanted is something to indicate the sacrosanctity which altars, vessels and the like share with sanctuaries (? ὅσ᾿ ἀφιερώσεως).</note>


<note n="9.97.c">If this is the meaning. So Mangey “uxore corrupta,”
but the phrase seems strange.</note>


<note n="9.97.d">Source unknown, thought by Nauck to be Euripides.</note>


<note n="9.97.e">According to Diog. Laert. i. 83 it was said to Halyattes the father of Croesus.</note>




<note n="9.98.1">Though Cohn does not notice it, something may be said
for Mangey’s suggestion of λαγάνων. λάχανα elsewhere, <hi rend="italic">e.g.
Spec. Leg.</hi> ii. 20, <hi rend="italic">De Prov.</hi> 70, are associated with the frugal
life.</note>


<note n="9.98.2">MSS. σπερμάτων. The manuscripts here appear to be
confused. In the same line where σιτοπόνων is printed,
M has πεμμάτων, the others πομάτων or σπερμάτων repeated. The correction σιτοπόνων is based on its frequent conjunction with ὀψαρτυτής, <hi rend="italic">e.g. De Vit. Cont.</hi> 53.</note>



<note n="9.99.a">The logical connexion demanded by παρ᾿ ὃ is not clear and Mangey may be right in supposing that something has been lost before this sentence.</note>
