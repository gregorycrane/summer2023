<note n="8.312.2">So MSS. Cohn prints τὰ μὲν [γενόμενα] &lt;ὡς&gt; ἡγημονικά, τὰ
δ᾿ ὡς ὑπήκοα [καὶ] γενησόμενα and translates “destined the
former to be subjects, the latter to be rulers.” I can see no
difficulty in the MSS. text if translated as above. It is an
indisputable truth that, while the heavenly bodies (in Philo’s
view) were created once for all, mortals are perpetually being
brought into being, and indeed Philo himself often insists
upon it in connexion with parenthood. If any correction is
required, I should omit the somewhat pointless ὡς and possibly
change καὶ to ἀεὶ = “from time to time.” But this is
hardly necessary, for though mortals will be perpetually
created, they were also created at the beginning. It is of course no objection to this that in § 9 he says that the necessaries for mortal subsistence were prepared from the beginning.</note>



<note n="8.313.a">The scheme here laid down is, with a slight difference of terms, identical with that given in <hi rend="italic">Mos.</hi> ii. 46 ff. There the Pentateuch is analysed into two parts, the historical and the legislative, but the historical is divided into the creation story and the “genealogical,” a term which was applied in the grammatical schools to that part of history which is concerned with particular persons, rather than with places, dates or events. See note to that passage (vol. vi. p. 606).</note>




<note n="8.314.1">MSS. δὲ or omit.</note>



<note n="8.315.a">See on <hi rend="italic">De Virt.</hi> 22.</note>


<note n="8.315.b">I understand this and the next section to refer to the
subsequent history of the Jewish Church and nation. The Pentateuch records the laws which Moses bequeathed, the later history examples of failure or success in carrying them out. Philo, however, never works out this part, and indeed hardly ever makes any allusion to the later history. See App. p. 451,</note>




<note n="8.316.1">One MSS. ἀφ᾿ ἑνὸς ἑκάστου, which Cohn adopts. Some
others either ἀφ᾿ or ἐφ᾿ ἑκάστου, omitting ἑνὸς. See note <hi rend="italic">b.</hi></note>



<note n="8.317.a">See note on the lacuna, § 78, App. p. 455.</note>


<note n="8.317.b">The translation takes τήν as agreeing with τιμήν understood
out of τιμαῖς. Cohn’s ἀφ᾿ for ἐφ᾿ would presumably
make it agree with ἀρχήν, though his translation “we will
make a beginning with the honours for single persons”
points rather to the other. The translation also takes τῶν
ἐν μέρει as partitive genitive after ἑκάστου, but it might possibly refer to the“ heads,” individuals, families, etc., i.e. begin among the particular heads with the honours to individuals.</note>


<note n="8.317.c">For Triptolemus see App. p. 451. The sequence of thought in these two sections is “just as God” (not a man as the pagan myth says) “provided the corn-seed for the body at the beginning, so he provided the seed of hope for the soul.”</note>


<note n="8.317.d">See note on the use of ἥμερος, § 60 App. p. 454.</note>




<note n="8.319.a">With ἀκόλουθα <hi rend="italic">sc.</hi> φύσει from above—a regular Stoic expression
in Philo. This is better, I think, than to take it
with πρός = “agreeing with” or “tending to.” So Mangey “consentanea perfectioni,” and so apparently Cohn. With this one would expect the dative rather than πρός.</note>




<note n="8.321.a">The next sections, largely repeating <hi rend="italic">De Abr.</hi> 7 ff., are
based on Gen. iv. 26, where the E.V. “He called his name
Enosh (A.V. Enos), then began men to call on the name of
the Lord God,” appears in the LXX “He called his name
Enos, he hoped to call on the name of the Lord God.” Enos
being a Hebrew word for man, Philo argues that his reward
for his hopefulness was that he received the name of man,
i.e. the true man. See note on <hi rend="italic">De Abr.</hi> 8.</note>


<note n="8.321.b">i.e. not a man, and therefore not either himself or any
other, but “man,” all that true manhood includes.</note>


<note n="8.321.c">Philo’s treatment of the story of Enoch is much the same as in the parallel passage <hi rend="italic">De Abr.</hi> 17 ff. It is based on Gen. v. 24 LXX as quoted in § 16 “he was not found because God transferred him.” E.V. “He was not, for God took him.” The chief differences are that the first part of the verse “Enoch was well pleasing to God,” is not noted here, and that “transferred,” which in <hi rend="italic">De Abr.</hi> is interpreted as a change from vice to virtue, is here taken more as “removed from familiar surroundings.” As to the interpretation given in Heb. xi. 5 “he was translated that he should not see death,” see note in vol. vi. p. 597.</note>




<note n="8.322.1">An odd word to connect with δίκτυα, which seems to be
used exclusively of nets, and though stakes might be set
round the nets, the reference must be to the way in which the prey would naturally be caught. Perhaps read περιπλέκεσθαι.</note>




<note n="8.325.b">namely, that though just and perfect, he was perfect only “in his generation,” i.e. as compared with his contemporaries. But the two “rewards” here mentioned are noted there as his rewards (<hi rend="italic">ibid.</hi> 46).</note>



<note n="8.325.a">Or taking πρός with μετοικισαμένῳ “now for the first time
come to settle in the land of virtue.”</note>


<note n="8.325.b">The treatment of Noah here is very brief compared with
<hi rend="italic">De Abr.</hi> 27–46. In particular nothing is said of the point
insisted on there as ranking him with the inferior Trinity,</note>


<note n="8.325.c">See App. p. 451.</note>




<note n="8.326.1">The transitive use of ἐπιλάμπω is quoted elsewhere only
as either later or poetical, and the fact that the eighteen
examples from Philo noted in the index, including § 37 below, are all intransitive rouses suspicion. Cohn proposes ἐπιπέμψῃ.</note>



<note n="8.327.a">i.e. those who despise vanity.</note>




<note n="8.328.1">Cohn holding that ἀκαμπής is an unsuitable epithet to
πόνος would insert a noun such as ἤθεσι. It is not unsuitable,
I think, if πόνος is thought of as “toiling” rather than
toil. In <hi rend="italic">De Mig.</hi> 223 it is applied to πόνος παιδείας.</note>



<note n="8.329.a">For Abraham’s faith <hi rend="italic">cf. De Abr.</hi> 262 ff.</note>


<note n="8.329.b">Both in form and accent εἰκόσι may be dative of εἰκών or εἰκός. The evidently intentional connexion with εἰκών points to the former, but on the other hand εἰκότα καὶ πιθανά is a frequent collocation with Philo, e.g. στοχασταὶ . . . πιθανῶν καὶ εἰκότων, <hi rend="italic">Spec. Leg.</hi> i. 61. I imagine that Philo did not consciously parse it here, but thought of it as coming from both or either. Cohn translating εἰκόσι by “Vermutungen” and εἰκών by “Bild” entirely obscures the point.</note>





<note n="8.332.1">So MSS. Cohn corrects to μόλις. I do not know why,
unless through observation of Philo’s usage. μόγις = “with
difficulty,” often associated with βραδέως,
etc., is a very suitable
word here. See Lexicon.</note>



<note n="8.333.a">I understand this sentence to mean that <hi rend="italic">prima facie</hi>
ether and heaven are of a higher nature than earth, air, and
water. Still, since they also belong to αἰσθητὴ φύσις, they share the indefiniteness and darkness which is only removed by νοητά, which as he says of the “ideas,” <hi rend="italic">Spec. Leg.</hi> i. 48, “give order to the disordered, definiteness to the indefinite, bounds to the boundless, shape to the shapeless.” See on § 46 (App. p. 452).</note>


<note n="8.333.b">In face of what has just been said of ether, Cohn must surely be wrong in translating “a purer beam of ether.”</note>




<note n="8.334.1">So all MSS. except A, which has ὄνομα, which is accepted
by Cohn. His translation “the only comprehensible idea
(or conception, Begriff) of His subsistence” I cannot fit
into the Greek, or indeed give any meaning to ὄνομα.</note>



<note n="8.335.a">Cohn translates “resisted the longing,” but is this sense?
<hi rend="italic">Cf. Spec. Leg.</hi> i. 37, 38, of the same subject, “the soul’s eye
is dizzied by the flashing of the rays. Yet it does not
therefore faintheartedly give up the task.”</note>


<note n="8.335.b">For the argument in these two sections <hi rend="italic">cf. Spec. Leg.</hi> i. 33 ff., and note giving reference to other authors, vol. vii. p. 616. The statement of it given in <hi rend="italic">Leg. All.</hi> iii. 97–99 resembles this still more closely, as those who gain the knowledge of God from creation are compared as here with those who have a higher inspiration, though the example there is Moses, not Jacob.</note>




<note n="8.336.1">So MSS. Cohn following Mangey ἀρετῶσαν. But <hi rend="italic">cf. De
Cher.</hi> 26 (of earth) ἡ δὲ μόνη τῶν τοῦ κόσμου μερῶν ἑστῶσα παγίως ἑστία πρὸς τῶν παλαιῶν ὠνόμασται. Here it is quite to the point as an antithesis to περιπολοῦντα οὐρανὸν.</note>



<note n="8.337.a">Lit. “by a probable (or reasonable) calculation,” <hi rend="italic">cf. De Dec.</hi> 40 εἰκότι μᾶλλον δ᾿ ἀληθεῖ λογισμῷ.</note>




<note n="8.339.a">Or very possibly (as Cohn) “having had his name
changed” (from Jacob to Israel), referring of course to Gen.
xxxii. 28 “thy name shall be called no more Jacob, but
Israel,” <hi rend="italic">cf. De Mut.</hi> 81. But see App. p. 452.</note>


<note n="8.339.b">I understand ἰδίαν, which Cohn ignores, to mean that
His existence is to be distinguished from all other existences,
and to give someting of the sense in which we speak of a
personal God.</note>


<note n="8.339.c"><hi rend="italic">Cf. De Som.</hi> ii. 70, where the monad is equated to the maker and the dyad to the thing made. See App. p. 452.</note>


<note n="8.339.d">Gen. xxxii. 25. <hi rend="italic">Cf. De Sam.</hi> i. 130, where the same phrase “ill-sounding name” is used and the same interpretation given. For the LXX “the broad part of the thigh was numbed” the R.V. has “the hollow of his thigh was strained” (A.V. “out of joint”).</note>




<note n="8.341.a">Or more accurately “currents of spirit force.” <hi rend="italic">Cf. Quis
Rerum</hi> 242, where the πνευματικοὶ τόνοι are the ligaments
which keep bodies in cohesion. See note there for some
references, to which add <hi rend="italic">De Aet.</hi> 125, where hard stones are
said to decompose when their ἔξις or cohesion weakens,
“ἕξις being a πνευματικὸς τόνος which though hard to loosen is
not unbreakable,” Cohn gives for it here “geistige Spannkraft,” Mangey “animi spiritus.” As stated in the note to <hi rend="italic">Quis Rerum</hi> 242, πνεῦμα, τόνος and ἕξις are almost convertible terms. But the application of them here to moral or spiritual life is unusual.</note>


<note n="8.341.b">Or “applications,”</note>




<note n="8.342.1">So MSS. Cohn reads συμφέρουσι and translates (ignoring
the feminine of ἄλλαις) “are of no use either to themselves or to
others.” So too Mangey “neque sibi ipsis neque aliis prosunt.”
I see little or no point in the remark. On the other
hand οὐ συμφέρονται=“do not agree with” gives an excellent
sense. <hi rend="italic">Cf. Spec. Leg.</hi> iii. 88, where δειλία and θράσος are
called antagonistic (μαχόμενα) passions. The battle of the
virtues against the vices is assisted by the disunion of the
latter.</note>



<note n="8.343.a">On §§ 49-51 see App. p. 453.</note>


<note n="8.343.b">For this often repeated remark about the “sacred” games <hi rend="italic">cf. e.g. De Agr.</hi> 113.</note>


<note n="8.343.c">i.e. opposite to the virtues, but perhaps better “antithetical” “opposed to each other,” as the three pairs of vices all fall under this head.</note>


<note n="8.343.d">Or “to themselves,” but ἑαντ- is often used reciprocally, and this best suits the sense, as I understand it. See note 1.</note>


<note n="8.343.e"><hi rend="italic">Cf. Mos.</hi> ii. 3, where the scheme here summarized, on which the whole book is based, is laid down.</note>




<note n="8.344.1">Cohn puts a full stop after ὑπαίτιον. But the accusative
ἀρχιερωσύνην shows that the construction after οἰκεῖον ἦν λαβεῖν
is continued and ἑρμηνεὺς . . . ὑπαίτιον is parenthetical.</note>



<note n="8.345.a">The thought seems to be as in <hi rend="italic">Spec. Leg</hi>. iv. 157, that
the divine election is somehow compatible with free choice
by the people.</note>


<note n="8.345.b"><hi rend="italic">Cf</hi>. Ex. iv. 10. Moses says “I am a stammerer (?) (ἰσχνόφωνος)
and slow of tongue.”</note>


<note n="8.345.c">The translation assumes that κλῆρον θεοῦ alludes to “the Lord is thy portion,” addressed to Levi. But the phrase is very strange. Possibly “the portion which God gave him,” but this again is strange as well as feeble. Mangey’s “quid-quid deus possidet” seems to me even less satisfactory, while Conn’s “das Erbe Gottes” tells us nothing. I understand τὴν ἰδίαν οὐσίαν to mean “his personal possessions.”</note>


<note n="8.345.d">On the definition of νόμος App. p. 454.</note>


<note n="8.345.e">The construction with οἰκεῖον ἦν λαβεῖν continues, see note 1.</note>




<note n="8.346.1">MSS. θελχθεὶς.</note>


<note n="8.346.2">So A. The other MSS. have ὃς, which Cohn follows. The
dative seems to me better sense. We do not come to Isaac’s
history till the next sentence. The point is that Abraham’s
family would have failed but for this one son. We might
perhaps have expected οὗ after ἐκδησάμενος, but the dative
can depend on ἐνωρμίσατο.</note>



<note n="8.347.a">The gist of the next four sections is that the reward to families as families only applies to Jacob’s children. Neither Abraham’s nor Isaac’s, both of which contained degenerate members, qualified for it.</note>


<note n="8.347.b">This perhaps rather than, as Cohn, “science,” as in <hi rend="italic">De Virt.</hi> 212, where see note. Compare also the Latin use of “mathematicus” = astrologer, Juv. xiv. 248, and elsewhere.</note>


<note n="8.347.c">See Gen. xxv. 6 “Abraham gave all that he had to Isaac his son, but to the sons of his concubines he gave gifts, and sent them away from Isaac his son.” <hi rend="italic">Cf. De Mig.</hi> 94.</note>




<note n="8.348.1">MSS. ἐργάτην.</note>


<note n="8.348.2">Cohn supposes that some words have fallen out between
διήγησιν and σύμβολον such as ταύτην· ἔστι δὲ καὶ. But “each
has the literal history as a symbol” for “has in its literal
history a symbol” is perhaps not impossible Greek.</note>



<note n="8.349.a">Or perhaps simply “belonging to the better class.” But
προαγωνιστήν suggests a military metaphor. <hi rend="italic">Cf. De Virt.</hi> 127.</note>


<note n="8.349.b">For the use of ἥμερος see App. p. 454.</note>


<note n="8.349.c">The allegory of §§ 61–65, which is only concerned with the “children,” that is with the different lines of conduct shown by the three types of souls, is difficult in parts, but the general gist is as follows:
(α) The soul susceptible to teaching is under many ignorant illusions, but ultimately discards them for knowledge.
(β) The naturally-gifted soul does not at once develop its instinctive love of good, but only when it reaches maturity. But there comes a stage when its instinctive love of happiness asserts itself. Till then its “Esau” and “Jacob” are treated with impartiality. There is a certain likeness to <hi rend="italic">De Sac.</hi> 15–16 and <hi rend="italic">Quis Rerum</hi> 294–299. Philo did not expect much positive virtue in early life.
(γ) The soul which consolidates its natural gifts and instruction by exercise produces all the virtues.</note>




<note n="8.350.1">MSS. ἐπιπλαδᾶν.</note>



<note n="8.351.a">The last words are obscure. As the good is stationary, why should the evil fly away? It would be possible to take ὅ as accusative after ἀποφεύγει, i.e. the mind in flying to the good is necessarily flying from evil, but no intelligible sense can be given to τὴν ἐναντίαν ὁδόν.</note>


<note n="8.351.b">Possibly he means that such health of soul leads to bodily health, or that its spiritual qualities are analogous to such bodily gifts. I do not understand the point of the “fine complexion from modesty.”</note>




<note n="8.352.1">Here I think the section, which Cohn places at ἐκ τοῦδε,
should begin. See note <hi rend="italic">a.</hi></note>


<note n="8.352.2">MSS. διδασκαλία (-αι or -ας).</note>


<note n="8.352.3">MSS. εὐμαρέστερον.</note>



<note n="8.353.a">i.e. the soul here described brings blessings or has influence
for good on the world around it, as the Zodiac, the
greatest of the heavenly bodies (<hi rend="italic">Spec. Leg.</hi> ii. 178, <hi rend="italic">De Som.</hi>
ii. 112), has above. What these blessings are is not stated.
(They may be perhaps identical with the specific qualities
assigned to the twelve tribes in <hi rend="italic">De Som.</hi> ii. 31–36.) But it
is enough that they have the perfection of twelve, which is
perfect as the duplication of the first perfect number six, see
<hi rend="italic">Spec. Leg.</hi> ii. 177. On the Zodiac see App. p. 454.
At this point the allegory of the three types of soul, though
alluded to incidentally in the next sentence, really ends, and we return to the main point, the “reward” to Jacob’s family, namely the headship of the tribes which expanded into the wisest of nations.</note>


<note n="8.353.b">For τυπωδέστερον L. &amp; S. (revised) gives “summarily,” quoting this passage. But the examples can hardly be called a summary. The treatment, however, is the same as that which is called γενικώτερον below, and both words may be used loosely to express incompleteness.</note>


<note n="8.353.c">Philo’s view of the Cain story, viz. that his punishment was to be always suffering the pains of dying yet never dead (<hi rend="italic">cf. De Virt.</hi> 200), has been stated earlier in <hi rend="italic">De Fug.</hi> 60, <hi rend="italic">De Conf.</hi> 122, and particularly <hi rend="italic">Quod Det.</hi> 177 f. As appears there, his scriptural basis is that Cain’s death is never recorded, and that the sign which God set upon him that no one should kill him really means that the mark which distinguished him was that he never was killed. Fantastic as the explanation is, it enables Philo to bring out a fine thought.</note>





<note n="8.356.1">Perhaps read ἐπικλύσει.</note>



<note n="8.357.a">So LXX Gen. iv. 12. The E.V. has “a fugitive and wanderer” (A.V. “vagabond”).</note>


<note n="8.357.b">Lit. “houses” or “families.” The term is extended to the Levites here, perhaps as members of a hereditary caste.</note>


<note n="8.357.c">For the story see Num. xvi. 1–35, and <hi rend="italic">cf. Mos.</hi> ii. 174 f. and 215-282.</note>




<note n="8.359.a">Presumably Korah, though there is no authority for
calling him the senior. Possibly this is induced by the confederacy
with the tribe of Reuben, which Philo mentions in
<hi rend="italic">Mos.</hi> ii. 175 as the πρεσβυτάτη φυλή, whose leader might
easily be called πρεσβύτατος. If so, it is a slip of memory, as
Korah was a Levite, not a Reubenite.</note>


<note n="8.359.b">i.e. 250, Num. xvi. 2.</note>


<note n="8.359.c">Verse 19 “Korah raised up against them all his company
(E.V. all the congregation) by the door of the tabernacle of
witness.”</note>


<note n="8.359.d">Or “that he should be thought,” which is perhaps the most natural way of taking the words, but does not agree with Philo’s other version of the story. Moses was accused of having invented the divine instructions, <hi rend="italic">cf. Mos.</hi> ii. 176 and 278.</note>


<note n="8.359.e">For the lacuna see App. p. 455.</note>




<note n="8.360.1">Cohn here inserts a title Περὶ εὐχῶν καὶ εὐλογιῶν. The
MSS. have no title, quite possibly, as he says, because the
beginning of this part of the treatise is lost. In my view (see
General Introduction, pp. xix. f.) there is really no need for
a title at all. But even if there is, the only authority for
the form which he adopts is that a quotation in St. John
Damascene’s parallels is cited as coming from “Philo, Περὶ
εὐχῆς καὶ εὐλογιῶν.” The words εὐχὰς ἃς “εὐλογίας” εἴωθεν ὀνομάζειν
in § 79 would point rather to Περὶ εὐχῶν ἤτοι εὐλογιῶν.</note>


<note n="8.360.2">Some MSS. λέγειν. Mangey λέγει, but see note <hi rend="italic">a.</hi></note>


<note n="8.360.3">MSS. τοῖς.</note>



<note n="8.361.a">Or “take and read” (imperative). The form follows the usual way of citing a document in Demosthenes.</note>


<note n="8.361.b">The blessings of Deut. xxviii. are given in the LXX in the optative form “may the Lord,” etc., where the E.V. has the future indicative “the Lord shall.”</note>


<note n="8.361.c">e.g. Deut. xi. 26, xxviii. 2.</note>


<note n="8.361.d">Lev. xxvi. 7, Deut. xxviii. 1, 7.</note>


<note n="8.361.e">For the next section see Deut. xxx. 11–14; <hi rend="italic">cf. De Virt.</hi> 183.</note>




<note n="8.362.1">MSS. ὑπήκοος.</note>



<note n="8.363.a">Or if it is preferred, “wisdom and prudence.” Philo has,
no doubt, in mind Deut. iv. 6 “ye shall keep them and do
them. For this is your wisdom and understanding” (σύνεσις).</note>


<note n="8.363.b">Deut. iv. 6 again. “They shall say ‘behold this great
nation is a wise and understanding (ἐπιστήμων) people.’”</note>


<note n="8.363.c">Deut. iv. 7. E.V. “What great nation is there that hath a god (or God) so nigh unto them, as the Lord our God is whensoever we call upon him?” Here the LXX has ποῖον ἔθνος μέγα ᾧ ἐστιν αὐτῷ θεὸς ἐγγίζων αὐτοῖς, which no doubt means the same thing. But Philo takes it as a question, “What nation is great?” answered by “One which has,” etc.</note>




<note n="8.364.1">MSS. πολύ γε or πολὺ γὰρ.</note>



<note n="8.365.a">Philo apparently does not contemplate a universal or
complete reformation of mankind before this change in the
animal world. A change of heart in some there must be before the pacification, but even then it will only mean peace between the beasts and good men. But it will be sufficiently general to shame men into a horror of war (§§ 91 f.). For the foundations of his belief in the pacification apart from the obvious Isaiah xi. 6–9 see App. p. 455.</note>




<note n="8.366.1">MSS. προσαίνοντα.</note>


<note n="8.366.2">So some MSS. Others ὁμοῖα, which Cohn prints, but supposes
that καὶ βλαβερὰ has fallen out, or ὁμοίως βλαβερὰ
should be substituted. This seems quite unnecessary. I
see no objection to ὅμορα to mark the proximity and therefore
greater dangerousness of the river animals as compared
with the marine.</note>



<note n="8.367.a">Cohn, if I do not misjudge him, would omit τῇ and take παραζηλώσει as a verb followed by the genitive τοῦ χειροήθους καὶ φιλοδεσπότου with which he understands ζῴου. But there is no reason to think that παραζηλοῦν can govern a genitive, and τοῦ χειροήθους καὶ φιλοδεσπότου is surely the neuter adjective used as an abstract noun. The verb understood is ἡμερωθήσεται from above and the noun παραζηλώσει is parallel to μιμήσει.</note>


<note n="8.367.b">See App. p. 456.</note>




<note n="8.368.1">MSS. ἄλλων.</note>


<note n="8.368.2">Perhaps συνιστῶνται. See note <hi rend="italic">c.</hi></note>



<note n="8.369.a">Lit. “older both in time and by (not, I think, “in”)
nature,” cf. § 85. The fact that it is created by nature in
itself makes it, as compared with the non-natural war of men
against men, πρεσβύτερος, though it is also so as judged by time.</note>


<note n="8.369.b">Quoted almost verbatim from Lev. xxvi. 6.</note>


<note n="8.369.c">Or “while they are coming to close quarters,” which should be the meaning if the indicative is kept (see note 2). μέχρι = “until,” referring to the future, is followed by the subjunctive, generally with, but sometimes without, ἄν.</note>

<note n="8.371.c">No particular text for this in the blessings. It is perhaps suggested by the parallel curse, Lev. xxvi. 37; cf. § 148.</note>


<note n="8.371.d">So <hi rend="italic">lxx</hi> in Num. xxiv. 7 “There shall come forth a man from his seed and shall rule over many nations.” The Hebrew appears to be totally different. E.V. “Water shall flow from his buckets, and his seed shall be in many waters.”</note>


<note n="8.371.e">E.V. “hornets.” Ex. xxiii. 28, Deut. vii. 20.</note>

<note n="8.373.b">Lev. xxvi. 3, 4, Deut. xi. 13, 14.</note>




<note n="8.374.1">This though perhaps translatable is strange. Cohn suggests
ἄσκησιν presumably = “by the practice of,” but for this
we should expect ἀσκήσεως. The same sense can be got
more easily by ἀσκηθεῖσι agreeing with οἷς, and this I think
may be the true reading. ἀσκεῖν in the sense of “train” is
not uncommon, though “practise” is more common at any
rate in Philo.</note>


<note n="8.374.2">Cohn wished to read ἕνεκα τοῦ = “in order that.” But
see note <hi rend="italic">c.</hi></note>



<note n="8.375.a">Lev. xxvi. 5.</note>


<note n="8.375.b">Or “decked out in.” This is the only way of taking the word if it is to stand. I do not think that Conn’s “acquired” or “earned” (“erworben”) is possible. See note 1.</note>


<note n="8.375.c">Cohn “in order that, “see note 2. But Philo is working on Deut. xxviii. 8 “The Lord send upon thee blessing on thy barns (ταμείοις), and upon all to which thou shalt lay thy hand (ἐπιβάλῃς τὴν χεῖρά σου).” The fullness of the barns is the natural consequence of the industry expressed in the second clause.</note>




<note n="8.376.1">After σπουδαζομένων Cohn inserts καλῶν from the quotation
of the passage by St. John Damascene, against the MSS.
It does not fit in well with my interpretation of the passage.
See note <hi rend="italic">c</hi> on p. 375.</note>


<note n="8.376.2">MSS. εὐτοκία, which, as they omit iotas subscript, may
be either nominative or dative. Cohn (like Mangey) printed
the nominative, but afterwards in his translation saw that
the dative was needed.</note>



<note n="8.377.a">Or perhaps “from time to time” = whatever at any time they pursue.</note>


<note n="8.377.b">So, rather than “loss” (Cohn), if the comparative has any sense. Poverty is painful anyway but more painful if it follows abundance.</note>


<note n="8.377.c">Deut. xv. 6.</note>


<note n="8.377.d">Deut. xxviii. 3.</note>


<note n="8.377.e">Deut. vii. 13, xxviii. 4.</note>




<note n="8.379.a">Ex. xxiii. 26 “There shall be no man childless nor woman
barren on thy land. The number of thy days I will surely
fulfil.” Philo quotes the first part of this verse, as it stands
in the LXX (E.V. “none shall cast her young nor be barren in thy land”), and the second part in § 111, where, however, he alters “I will fulfil” to “thou shalt fulfil.”</note>


<note n="8.379.b">i.e. the text does mean that long life in the literal sense is one of the promised blessings, but it also gives through the κύρια ὀνόματα (ἀριθμός and ἡμέρα) the spiritual lesson that the higher meaning of long life is good life.

<note n="8.380.1">MSS. φησίν.</note>


<note n="8.380.2">Clearly a mistake of the scribe, presumably for ὅλῳ, or
possibly for καὶ (κ΄) ὅλῳ, though the double καὶ = “also”
would be rather heavy.</note>



<note n="8.381.a">See App. p. 457.</note>


<note n="8.381.b">The next words show that Philo wishes to emphasize both parts of καλοκἀγαθία.</note>

<note n="8.382.1">MSS. ἀπογιγνώσκεσθαι.</note>


<note n="8.382.2">So one MSS. The others ἐκτετμημένων or ἐκτεταμένων.
Mangey adopted the last and translated “infensis,” but
ἐκτείνω cannot have this meaning. But neither does ἐκτετιμημένων
give a meaning which is very appropriate here.
Possibly &lt;καὶ&gt; ἐκτεταμένον = “tortured,” a meaning more
commonly given to ἐπιτείνω, but also to ἐκτείνω. <hi rend="italic">Cf.</hi> δέσποιναι
. . . κατατείνουσι, <hi rend="italic">Spec. Leg.</hi> iv. 82.</note>


<note n="8.382.3">MSS. βεβαίωσις.</note>



<note n="8.383.a">Evidently an allegorization of Deut. xxx. 4 “if thy dispersion (διασπορά, E.V. thy outcasts) be from one end of heaven to the other, the Lord will gather thee thence.”</note>


<note n="8.383.b">This is perhaps implied by the change from the perfect ἐζηλωκόσι to the present μετατρέχουσι.</note>


<note n="8.383.c">Philo combines the two senses of φυγή, “escape” and “banishment”; cf. note to <hi rend="italic">De Fuga</hi> 118. The translation is somewhat expanded to bring this out.</note>




<note n="8.385.a">i.e. the bodily is more akin to the man than the external.
But very possibly “more akin to these.” If so, the comparative
means “more akin than those of the soul.” The
three forms of the good are such a familiar idea, that this
might be understood.</note>


<note n="8.385.b">Deut. vii. 15, there promised absolutely. Philo feels the
necessity to qualify it by the possibility of sickness sent as
a trial or warning, and to justify it by the need of bodily
tranquillity for the working of the good mind. See General
Introduction, p. xxi.</note>


<note n="8.385.c">Perhaps “congenital and lifelong” may better express the superlative.</note>


<note n="8.385.d">Not, I think, as Cohn “<hi rend="italic">our</hi> mind,”i.e. the human mind generally, but the mind of the σπουδαῖος, which for the rest of the Blessings becomes the true Israel to which the Blessings are addressed.</note>




<note n="8.386.1">So Mangey for MSS. ἀμέθεκτον, which Cohn retains, supposing
some such word as νόσων to have fallen out. ἀμέθελκτον
has been used in the adverbial form in <hi rend="italic">De Fuga</hi> 92, and
here makes excellent sense.</note>


<note n="8.386.2">A ἀνάγκαι (omitting γεννῶσιν). The others γεννῶσι
δυνάμεις.</note>


<note n="8.386.3">The text is uncertain and that adopted here may not
meet with general acceptance. The majority of MSS. have
ἢ γὰρ περιέψυξέ τις ἢ περιέφλεξεν αὖον καὶ αὐχμηρὸν ἢ τοὐναντίον
ῥοῶδες ἀπειργάσατο. A has τι for τις and οὐρανὸς for αὖον.
The first is not intelligible as it stands, and I have corrected
ἢ to εἰ and τις to τι. The second is adopted by Mangey.
Cohn expunges both αὖον and οὐρανὸς, holding that αὖον was
a gloss on αὐχμηρὸν and was subsequently corrupted to #x0305;οὐ̅νος = οὐρανὸς. He rather strangely says that οὐρανὸς makes no sense. Assuming that Philo is continuing the figure of the house, to which the terms are surely more applicable than to the body, οὐρανὸς = “weather” makes good sense and I should be willing to accept it <hi rend="italic">in addition to</hi> αὖον.</note>



<note n="8.387.a">Or “necessities.”</note>


<note n="8.387.b">More literally “laying upon it through greed the domination of the πάθη “(here of course not used in the ordinary sense in Philo of the “passions”). But the middle ἐπιθέμεναι and the repetition of πάθη seem to me strange.</note>


<note n="8.387.c">Lev. xxvi. 12. E.V. “walk among you.” See A pp. p. 457.</note>




<note n="8.389.a">Lev. xxvi. 13 “who brought you out of the land of
Egypt when you were slaves, and I broke the bond of your
yoke.”</note>


<note n="8.389.b">So the LXX continuing the verse “and I brought you
with open speech,” μετὰ παρρησίας (E.V. “and made you go
upright”).</note>


<note n="8.389.c">Deut. xxviii. 13, <hi rend="italic">cf. v.</hi> 44.</note>


<note n="8.389.d">The allegorical meaning seems to be that while the σπουδαῖος is the source of spiritual life to all who, though not of his excellence, are true members of the body, the transgressors have no part in this life, but are only a slavish instrument, for what purpose is not stated.</note>




<note n="8.390.1">So Cohn for MSS. ἐργασάμενοι as more logical. I follow
him with some doubt.</note>


<note n="8.390.2">For this obvious corruption Cohn suggests ἀφθονίας or
εὐθηνίας, but “you expect good fortune, but you will have
bad fortune rather than good fortune” is somewhat feeble. I
have ventured to translate a conjecture of my own which
seems textually no more difficult and gives a better point
τῆς &lt;οὐκ&gt; ἀτυχίας μᾶλλον ἢ τῆς ἀσεβείας &lt;τιμωρίας&gt;, “you
expect good fortune: you will get—not bad fortune, that is
not the right word, but,” etc. οὐ or μή is so frequently lost
in the MSS. of Philo that it hardly counts, and the falling out
of another word ending in -ιας is at least as easy a mistake as the substitution of an alien and nonsensical word, οὐ . . . μᾶλλον ἤ for μᾶλλον δέ constantly recurs in Philo, e.g. § 163.</note>

<note n="8.391.d">Deut. xxviii. 40.</note>


<note n="8.391.e">The LXX has ἐλαία (olive tree) ἐκρυήσεται, probably meaning the same as the E.V. “cast its fruit.” Philo may have read ἔλαιον, or perhaps made a slip.</note>




<note n="8.393.a">Deut. xxviii. 42. For the LXX ἐρυσίβη, “mildew” the
E.V. has “locusts.”</note>


<note n="8.393.b">ἀποκρίνειν, “to sift off,” seems to be used in the same
way as in <hi rend="italic">Mos.</hi> ii. 180 ἀμφοτέρων εἰς μίαν ἰδέαν ἀποκριθέντων, cf. also <hi rend="italic">Spec. Leg.</hi> i. 218, <hi rend="italic">De Som.</hi> i. 210. Cohn strangely translates “will pass into each other or separate.”</note>


<note n="8.393.c">Or “unstable,” cf. its application to the profligate, <hi rend="italic">De Fug.</hi> 28, and the multitude, <hi rend="italic">De Ebr.</hi> 198.</note>


<note n="8.393.d">Lev. xxvi. 19, Deut. xxviii. 23.</note>




<note n="8.394.1">For the corrupt καρπὸν Cohn suggests κακὸν. The translation
again takes a very tentative guess of my own, καπνὸν,
which in form suits well, and smoke does choke. But I do
not know of any example of καπνός apart from fire. Philo,
however, is transcribing the LXX, and we do not know what
conception he formed of the χοῦς coming down from heaven.
He may have connected it with the fiery rain of Gen. xix.</note>



<note n="8.395.a">Deut. xxviii. 24 “The Lord make the rain of thy land dust
(κονίορτος), and dust (χοῦς) shall come down from heaven.”
In E.V. “powder and dust; from heaven shall it (apparently
both) come down upon thee.”</note>


<note n="8.395.b">Or “to destroy by stifling heat (πνῖγος).” So Cohn (“Glut”). It is true that in all the examples of πνῖγος quoted in the Lexicon, it is applied to the effects of heat, but this does not prove that it may not sometimes have retained its original general meaning.</note>


<note n="8.395.c">Lev. xxvi. 31.</note>


<note n="8.395.d">So Mangey “mox secutae,” cf. ἐξαπιναίους, § 150. But I cannot find any authority for this use of πρόσκαιρος, which regularly means “for the occasion” or “transient.” This is impossible here, for Philo cannot be referring here to the restoration of the penitent. Mangey proposed omitting βαρυδαιμονίας, but surely Philo would have written the words in a different order.</note>


<note n="8.395.e">For this section see Lev. xxvi. 29, Deut. xxviii. 53–57.</note>


<note n="8.395.f">Atreus murdered the two sons of his brother Thyestes, and dressed and served up their flesh to their father.</note>




<note n="8.396.1">Cohn’s insertion. I doubt its necessity: ἧττον, in itself
“a smaller thing,” can = “easier.”</note>


<note n="8.396.2">Cohn, though printing ἐργάσοιτο, suggested ἐργάσαιτο.
But the future optative representing Oratio Obliqua seems
more effective.</note>



<note n="8.397.a">There is no authority in Leviticus or Deuteronomy for
these two sections. Philo is perhaps so familiar with suicide
as a way of escaping misery that he feels that the curse to
be complete must include inability to make use of it.</note>


<note n="8.397.b">The translation takes μυθεύω in the sense of “to tell”
(a myth), Cohn as “invent,” and ὑπερβολάς as desire for the hyperbolical. This does not seem to me to suit the plural.</note>




<note n="8.398.1">MSS. νόμοις.</note>

of iron upon thy neck.”</note>


<note n="8.399.b">Philo may perhaps obtain this by taking <hi rend="italic">v.</hi> 48 to mean
“in your hunger, etc., you will become servants to your enemies.” In <hi rend="italic">v.</hi> 68 the E.V. has “you will sell yourselves,”
but the LXX is passive “you will be sold.” Some texts have “thou shalt put a yoke.” If Philo read this, it would assist the idea.</note>


<note n="8.399.c">Deut. xxviii. 34 “Thou shalt be distraught (παράπληκτος) because of the sights of thine eyes which thou shalt see.”
The next two sentences reproduce <hi rend="italic">vv.</hi> 30–31.</note>


<note n="8.399.d">Perhaps based on <hi rend="italic">v.</hi> 32 “thy hand shall not be strong.”

<note n="8.400.1">MSS. κενωθήσονται.</note>


<note n="8.400.2">MSS. εὐοδώσει.</note>



<note n="8.401.a">The next two sections are a development of Deut. xxviii. 16–19, the last part of § 142 interpreting “cursed shalt thou be in thy coming in and going out.” <hi rend="italic">Cf.</hi> his interpretation of that phrase in the Blessings 113. The last words are a close reminiscence of v. 20 “because of thy evil practices (πονηρὰ ἐπιτηδέυματα) and because thou hast forsaken (ἐγκατέλιπες) me.”</note>


<note n="8.401.b">The bodily curses are mainly based with much expansion on Deut. xxviii. 22, 27, 35, and Lev. xxvi. 16. The terms ἴκτερος, σφακελίζω, τηκεδών come from Leviticus, and πυρετός,
ῥῖγος, ψώρα ἀγρία, ἕλκος from Deuteronomy.</note>




<note n="8.402.1">So MSS. and so apparently the best text of the MSS. Many
authorities, however, have in Lev. xxvi. 16 τὸν ἴκτερα σφακελίζοντα
τοὺς ὀφθαλμούς, in accordance with which Mangey
corrected ὀφθαλμοῖς to -ούς. Presumably this is more in
accordance with the Hebrew, as the E.V. has “fever, that
shall consume the eyes.” But no instance is quoted of
σφακελίζω as transitive.</note>


<note n="8.402.2">Cohn prints πάρεσις . . . δεινά as a parenthesis, holding
that τοῦ μὲν ἐν φλεψὶν κτλ. continues the construction of the
previous sentence. It seems to me quite unnecessary. The
genitives absolute follow naturally on βαρυτέροις.</note>



<note n="8.403.a">This seems the ordinary meaning of the word, though perhaps not very suitable here. Cohn “inflammation.”
Perhaps simply “wasting away,” which seems to be the meaning of the word in Deut. xxviii. 32 οἱ ὀφθαλμοί σου βλέψονται σφακελίζοντες (E.V. “look, and fail with longing”). But Philo is quoting from the LXX, and it is perhaps useless to inquire what meaning he put upon it.</note>


<note n="8.403.b">Or “that the tongue is crippled . . . are conditions,”
i.e. disability of the senses is a necessary but minor accompaniment (the only one actually mentioned is blindness (ἀορασία, <hi rend="italic">v.</hi> 32).</note>


<note n="8.403.c">Based on <hi rend="italic">v.</hi> 35 “The Lord smite thee on the legs and on the knees.”</note>




<note n="8.404.1">Cohn places the paragraph after the next sentence. But
the break is surely here, where we pass from the bodily
afflictions to those of war.</note>


<note n="8.404.2">So MSS. Cohn προκαταδύντες = “because they have fallen
into the snares before they get there”? The MSS. reading
seems to me to give a more natural interpretation of the MSS.
in Lev. xxvi. 25 “ye shall flee to your cities and I will send
out death to you and ye shall be delivered (or betrayed,
παραδώσεσθε) into the hands of your enemies.” The enemy
have access to the cities through accomplices, as the Thebans had in Plataea (Thuc. ii. 22). The E.V., which has “pestilence” instead of “death,” gives a different picture.</note>



<note n="8.405.a">This looks like a reminiscence of <hi rend="italic">v</hi>. 56 “She that is tender (ἁπαλή) and delicate (τρυφερά) among you whose foot has not attempted to go upon the ground because of her tenderness and delicacy,” though the context is totally different. πανάπαλοι is Homeric, <hi rend="italic">cf. Odyssey</hi> xiii. 223.</note>


<note n="8.405.b">More literally “have grown wild,” which in English hardly answers to the description.</note>


<note n="8.405.c">For the medical use of κάκωσις for the consequences of disease see L. &amp; S.</note>


<note n="8.405.d">Lev. xxvi. 25.</note>


<note n="8.405.e">So in Lev. xxvi. 21, 23, 27 ἐὰν πορεύησθε πλαγιάζοντες. E.V. “walk contrary to me.”</note>




<note n="8.406.1">So Cohn (in translation) for MSS. φερόμενος, cf. MSS.
φωνὴ φύλλου φερομένου.</note>


<note n="8.406.2">So MSS. Cohn ἀγριώτατοι.</note>



<note n="8.407.a">Or “agitation.” πτοία, though connected by Philo with
fear, is applicable to other kinds of excitement. See note,
vol. vii. p. 612.</note>


<note n="8.407.b">Lev. xxvi. 36, where Philo perhaps read with some MSS.
δειλίαν for δουλείαν (E.V. “faintness”). The rumours seem
to be his interpretation of the “driven leaf.”</note>


<note n="8.407.c">Lev. xxvi. 37. MSS. καὶ ὑπερόψεται ὁ ἀδελφὸς τοῦ ἀδελφοῦ

<note n="8.408.2">MSS. δυσμενείας.</note>


<note n="8.408.3">MSS. φθινομένην, φθιομένην and A οὐ φθειρομένην (so
Mangey).</note>



<note n="8.409.a">For this section see Deut. xxviii. 65–67. In the last
words “for the fear of thy heart which thou shalt fear, and
the sights of thy eyes which thou shalt see,” Philo takes
the “fears” to apply to the morning and the “sights” (i.e.
dreams) to the evening or night.</note>


<note n="8.409.b">For this section see Deut. xxviii. 43 “The stranger (προσήλυτος
within thee shall mount higher and higher (ἄνω ἄνω)
and thou shalt descend lower and lower (κάτω κάτω).”
Philo’s persistent determination to make προσήλυτος = “proselyte”
leads him here as elsewhere to ignore the context, which continues “he shall lend to thee and thou shalt not lend to him.” The “place in heaven” (perhaps better “high as heaven”) does not of course refer to an after life but merely represents the emphatic ἄνω ἄνω, as “Tartarus” the κάτω κάτω.</note>


<note n="8.409.c">The sections that follow are mainly based on Lev. xxvi. 33–35 (<hi rend="italic">cf. v.</hi> 43) “your land shall be desolate and your cities shall be desolate. Then the land shall enjoy (εὐδοκήσει) its sabbaths in the days of its desolation . . . it shall keep sabbaths, which it kept not among your sabbaths, when ye dwelt in it.” On the word “enjoy” or “be well pleased”
Philo builds a denunciation of the neglect of the sabbatical year as a wrong to the land, somewhat in the same spirit as his discourse on kindness to plants, <hi rend="italic">De Virt.</hi> 155–160, and to the land, <hi rend="italic">Spec. Leg.</hi> iv. 215 ff.</note>




<note n="8.410.1">MSS. ἐπιστάντες.</note>



<note n="8.411.a">On these symbols of peace see App. p. 457. The general
meaning is that anyone capable of violating the Sabbath and
sabbatical year is capable of any inhumanity.</note>


<note n="8.411.b">Or “all things,” but see App. p. 458.</note>


<note n="8.411.c">Lit. “are Seven.” On this, which seems to me to go beyond the other phrases in which Philo extols the mystical virtues of Seven, see App. p. 458.</note>


<note n="8.411.d">The translation suggests a distinction between ἐπιθυμία, a desire not yet translated into an active impulse, and ὁρμή. But I have not seen anything either in Philo or <hi rend="italic">S.V.F.</hi> to support it. Cohn translates “letting their desires have free course in an unbridled and wicked way,” but I do not understand what he makes of ἐφιστάντες. Perhaps some other correction should be made for the MSS. ἐπιστάντες, such as ἐπιχαλάσαντες.</note>




<note n="8.413.a">Isaiah liv. 1 “for more are the children of the desolate than the children of the married wife.” LXX τῆς ἐχούσης τὸν
ἄνδρα.</note>




<note n="8.414.1">So Mangey and Cohn for MSS. εὔτεκνον. I do not feel
sure about this correction. For though εὔτεκνον ἀγαθόν
would be a strange expression, the position of εὔτεκνος is also
strange.</note>


<note n="8.414.2">Cohn finally accepted Mangey’s correction to διάνοιαν,
but see note <hi rend="italic">c.</hi></note>



<note n="8.415.a">Though starting from the verse in Isaiah, the allegory
of the soul is more concerned with 1 sam. ii. 5 (Hannah’s
song) “yea, the barren hath borne seven; and she that hath
many children languisheth. The Lord killeth, and maketh
alive,” a passage quoted to the same effect <hi rend="italic">Quod Deus</hi> 10, <hi rend="italic">De Mut.</hi> 143. Here the LXX has ἡ πολλὴ ἐν τέκνοις ἠσθένησε. ὁ κύριος θανατοῖ καὶ ζωογονεῖ, in which the phrases ἡ πολλὴ for πολλὰ ἔχουσα τέκνα, ἠσθένησε, ζωογονεῖ, and perhaps θανατοῖ in θανατᾷ are echoed by Philo.</note>


<note n="8.415.b"><hi rend="italic">Cf. De Cher.</hi> 50.</note>


<note n="8.415.c">Another echo of ἠσθένησε. The substitution of διάνοιαν would miss this point.</note>


<note n="8.415.d">Compare the glorification of hope. §§ 7–14 above and <hi rend="italic">De Mut.</hi> 157 ff., where also the phrase χαίρειν πρὸ χαρᾶς occurs.</note>


<note n="8.415.e">Lit. the “nature of the One.” The theological use of “substance” is, I think, much the same.</note>




<note n="8.416.1">The word seems impossible as it stands. Cohn suggested
δυσμενείας, but later rejected it and inclined to Mangey’s
ἐπανατάσεις. But the curses at this point are not threats,
but actual punishments. If anything of this kind, κολάσεις.
But τὰς &lt;κολαστηρίους&gt; δυνάμεις would not be out of place,
<hi rend="italic">cf. De Ebr.</hi> 32 τὰς κολαστηρίους δυνάμεις πῶς ἐπιφερομένας οἴσομεν; <hi rend="italic">De Conf.</hi> 171 αἱ κολαστήριοι (<hi rend="italic">sc.</hi> δυνάμεις)· ἔστι δὲ καὶ ἡ κόλασις οὐκ ἐπιζήμιον, ἁμαρτημάτων οὖσα κώλυσις καὶ ἐπανόρθωσις.
Though κολαστηρίους can hardly be understood here, it may have fallen out.</note>

<note n="8.419.a">These remarkable words are regarded by Cohn (Introduction to translation, p. 382) as a somewhat obscure allusion
to the Jewish expectation of a personal Messiah. But need
they indicate more than a belief that in the second deliverance
the nation would be guided as they were in the first by the
Cloud in which was a θεία ὄψις flashing rays of fire, <hi rend="italic">Mos.</hi>

<note n="8.419.d">This is presumably founded on Lev. xxvi. 42 “I will remember my covenant with Abraham . . . and with Isaac . . . and with Jacob.” But the idea of the departed saints acting as intercessors, which Cohn <hi rend="italic">l.c.</hi> notes as a genuinely Jewish idea, is, I think, unique in Philo. Indeed he rarely if ever suggests any conscious activity on their part. The nearest approaches to it which I have noted are in <hi rend="italic">De Sac.</hi> 5, <hi rend="italic">Quis Rerum</hi> 276 and <hi rend="italic">Mos.</hi> ii. 288.</note>
