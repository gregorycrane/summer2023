<head>On Flight and Finding</head>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="1"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="1"/> “And Sarai evil-entreated her, and she fled

from her face. And an angel of the Lord found her at the fountain of water in the wilderness, at the fountain in the way to Shur. And the angel of the Lord said unto her, ‘Handmaid of Sarai, whence comest thou? and whither goest thou?’ And she said, ‘From the face of Sarai my mistress I am fleeing.’ And the angel of the Lord said unto her, ‘Return to thy mistress, and humble thyself under her hands’ (Gen. xvi. 6–9). And the angel of the Lord said unto her, ‘Behold, thou art with child, and shalt bear a son; and thou shalt call his name Ishmael, because the Lord hath hearkened to thy humiliation.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="2"><p> He shall be a dweller in the fields; his hands shall be against all men, and all men’s hands shall be against him’“ (<hi rend="italic">ibid</hi>. 11, 12).Having in the

preceding treatise said what was fitting about the courses of preliminary training and about evilentreatment, we will next proceed to set forth the subject of fugitives. For the Lawgiver has in several places made mention of those who run away, as he does here, saying of Hagar that upon being evil-entreated “she ran away from the face of her mistress.”
<milestone unit="para"/>There are, I think, three motives for flight:</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="3"><p> hatred,

fear, and shame. From hatred wives leave husbands

<pb n="13"/>

and husbands wives; from fear children leave their parents and servants their masters; from shame friends leave their fellows when something they have done displeases them. I know fathers whose effeminacy has made them unwilling to face the strict and philosophic life of their sons, and who out of shame have chosen to live in the country instead of in the city.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="4"><p> Instances of the working of these

three motives are to be found in the sacred writings. Jacob, the Practiser, as we shall presently shew, flies from his father-in-law Laban out of hatred, from his brother Esau out of fear.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="5"><p> Hagar’s motive

for departing is shame.A sign of this is the fact that an angel, a Divine Word, meets her to advise the right course, and to suggest return to the house of her mistress. This angel addresses her in the encouraging words, “The Lord hath hearkened to thy humiliation” (Gen. xvi. 11), a humiliation prompted neither by fear nor by hatred, the one the feeling of an ignoble, the other of a quarrelsome soul, but by shame, the outward expression of inward modesty.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="6"><p> Had she run away

owing to fear, the angel would probably have moved her who had inspired the fear to a gentler frame of mind; for then, and not till then, would it have been safe for the fugitive to go back. But no angel first approached Sarai, seeing that she is favourably disposed of her own accord. But it is Hagar who is taught by the angel monitor,
<note n="5.13.a">Or “by conviction” (personified). See note on <hi rend="italic">Quod Deus</hi> 125.</note>
  whose goodwill to her makes him at once her friend and counsellor, not to feel only shame, but to be of good courage as well; pointing out that shame apart from confidence is but a half virtue.

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="7"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="2"/> The ensuing argument will bring to light the



<pb n="15"/>

more subtle traits of shame. I must now go back to the heads suggested, and must begin with those who run away because of hatred. We are told that “Jacob kept Laban the Syrian in the dark, so as not to tell him that he is fleeing, and he fled, himself and all that belonged to him” (Gen. xxxi.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="8"><p> 20 f.). What,

then, was the cause of the hatred? You would like perhaps to be told this. There are people who fashion their God out of substance devoid of quality or form or shape
<note n="5.15.a">The allusion to Anaxagoras in § 10 perhaps suggests that some definite persons or school is meant, possibly his predecessors the Ionic philosophers. See App. p. 581.</note>
 ; but the moving Cause they neither know, nor have taken any trouble to learn from those who do know Him. They have neither mastered nor do they study the fairest subject of all, the first, nay the only one, whose knowledge it was a vital matter for them to acquire.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="9"><p> Laban is of this class; for the

sacred oracles assign to him the flock that is without mark (Gen. xxx. 42); and in the universe it is the matter devoid of quality and in men the ignorant and untutored soul that is without mark.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="10"><p> Others there

are of the better part, who said that Mind came and ordered all things,
<note n="5.15.b">See Diog. Laert. ii. 6 (the opening words of Anaxagoras’s treatise), πάντα χρήματα ἦν ὁμοῦ· εἷτα νοῦς ἐλθὼν αὐτὰ διεκόσμησε.</note>
  bringing the disorder that prevailed in existing things as the result of mob-rule into the order of regular government under a king.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="11"><p> Of this company Jacob is a votary, who is in charge of the variegated flock, marked and distinguished; and in the universe it is form that has variety and distinction, while among men it is the understanding, well-trained and loving to learn.The man of mark, associate of true monarchy, has

imbibed in full measure the inbred spirit of fellowship, and comes to the man of no mark, when he fashions, as I said before, material sovereignties as


<pb n="17"/>

Divine, and holds no sovereignty outside of these to be efficient,—comes to him to teach him that he is mistaken.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="12"><p> For the world has come into being, and

assuredly it has done so under the hand of some Cause; and the Word of Him who makes it is Himself the seal, by which each thing that exists has received its shape. Accordingly from the outset form in perfection accompanies the things that come into being, for it is an impress and image of the perfect Word.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="13"><p> For the living creature that has come

into being is imperfect in quantity, as is shewn by its constant growth as its age advances, but perfect in quality; for the same quality continues, inasmuch as it is the impress of a Divine Word ever continuing and free from every kind of change.
<note n="5.17.a">See App. p. 581.</note>


</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="14"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="3"/>

Jacob, seeing that Laban has grown deaf to instruction or lawful authority, naturally plans to run away, fearing lest, besides being unable to help, he should suffer harm at his hands.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="15"><p> For association with men devoid of sense is hurtful, and the soul often involuntarily takes the impressions of their mad folly; and in the nature of things culture feels a repugnance towards lack of culture, and painstaking towards carelessness.And so the faculties of the

Practiser lift their voice aloud, proclaiming
<note n="5.17.b">Or “giving in addition.”</note>
  their grounds for hatred: “Is there yet any portion or inheritance for us in our father’s house? Are we not counted of him strangers? For he hath sold us, and hath also quite devoured our money. All the riches and the glory, which God took away from our father, shall be for us and for our children” (Gen. xxxi.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="16"><p> 14–16). For being free both in names
<note n="5.17.c">I can give no satisfactory explanation of “names.” See App. pp. 581 f.</note>
  and in sentiments,



<pb n="19"/>

they deem no senseless man to be rich or glorious, but all such, speaking broadly, to be poor and inglorious, even if they surpass in fortune wealthy kings. For they do not say that they will have their father’s wealth, but that which was taken away from their father, nor his glory, but the glory that was taken away from him.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="17"><p> The worthless man is destitute

of the real riches and the true gloriousness; for these good things are won by sound sense and self-mastery and the dispositions akin to these, which are the inheritance of virtue-loving souls.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="18"><p> Accordingly it is not

the things that pertain to the good-for-nothing man, but those of which he has been stripped, that are affluence and renown to the worthy. Virtues are what has been stripped from him, and has become the property of the worthy, thus bringing into harmony what is said elsewhere: “we will sacrifice the abominations of Egypt to the Lord our God” (Exod. viii. 26); for victims perfect and free from blemish are the virtues and virtuous conduct, and these the Egyptian body, in its devotion to the passions, abominates.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="19"><p> For even as in this passage, understood in

accordance with reality, things which Egyptians reckon profane are called sacred in the estimation of the keen-sighted, and are all offered in sacrifice; exactly in the same way, the things of which every foolish man has been deprived and stripped, these the comrade of nobility of character will inherit. And these are real glory, indistinguishable from knowledge, and wealth, not the blind wealth, but that which has the keenest sight for the things that actually are, which accepts no counterfeit coinage, nay nothing whatever that is soulless, even though it be approved coin.
<note n="5.19.a">The meaning seems to be that while the three Aristotelian ἀγαθά, viz. τὰ περὶ ψυχήν, τὰ περὶ σῶμα and τὰ ἐκτός may be δόκιμα in a sense, for even the Stoics admitted “preferable indifferents” among the two latter, only the first is acceptable to the true Practiser. See <hi rend="italic">Quod Det.</hi> 7 and note, also <hi rend="italic">De Gig.</hi> 38.</note>


<pb n="21"/>
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="20"><p><milestone unit="para"/>Right fitly, therefore, will Jacob run away from the

man who has no part in the good things of God, the man who, even in finding fault with another, impugns himself without knowing it when he says, “If thou hadst told me, I would have sent thee forth” (Gen. xxxi. 27). For this alone would have been a sufficient ground for flight, if, when you were the slave of ten thousand masters, you assumed the style of dominion and lordship and proclaimed liberty to others.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="21"><p> I however,

says Jacob, took no man to help me to find the way that leads to virtue, but paid heed to Divine oracles bidding me depart hence, and to this moment they guide my steps.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="22"><p> And how wouldst thou have

sent me forth? Would it have been, as thou didst grandiloquently recount, “with merriment“that caused me pain, and “music” all unmusical, and “drums” noises inarticulate and meaningless, inflicting blows on the soul through the ears, “and with cithara” (<hi rend="italic">ibid</hi>.), not instruments but modes of conduct void of melody or harmony? Nay, these are the very things that made me plan flight; but you, it seems, devised them as means of diverting me back from flight, to induce me to retrace my steps for the sake of the power to cheat and mislead inbred in those senses which I had with difficulty gained strength to tread underfoot.

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="23"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="4"/> Hatred, then, was the cause of the flight that

has been spoken of, but fear of that of which I am about to speak. For we read as follows: “Rebecca said to Jacob, ‘Lo, Esau thy brother threatens to kill thee. Now therefore, child, listen to my voice and arise and flee to Laban my brother to Haran, and live with him for some days, until the wrath and

<pb n="23"/>

anger of thy brother turn away, and he forget the things which thou hast done to him: and I will send and fetch thee thence’ “(Gen. xxvii. 42–45). For</p></div><div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="24"><p>

there is reason to fear lest the worse part of the soul set an ambush and lie in wait, or even openly arm, and then overthrow and cast down the better part. And this is excellent advice given by Rebecca, that is, by judicious Patience.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="25"><p>
<note n="5.23.a">For a comparison of this interpretation of fleeing from Esau’s wrath with that given in <hi rend="italic">De Mig.</hi> 210, 211 see App. p. 582.</note>
  Whenever, she says, you

see the base one flowing in full current against virtue, and taking much account of things which it ought to disregard, of wealth, fame, pleasure, when he extols injustice as the author of each of these, and points out that it is mostly wrongdoers who attain to fame and to abundance of gold and silver, do not take at once the opposite direction, and practise penury and humility and a strict and unsocial mode of life;</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="26"><p> for in this way you will rouse your adversary’s spirit and stimulate
<note n="5.23.b">Or “prepare,” “give strength to,” a definite reference to the gymnastic school. So below παλαίσματα= wrestling-grips.</note>
  a more dangerous foe to the contest against you.Consider,

then, by what course of action you are to escape his machinations. Adapt yourself, not to his pursuits and practices, but to the objects which serve to create them
<note n="5.23.c">Or τῶν εἰρημένων may refer to wealth, fame, and pleasure, § 25. See App. pp. 582 f.</note>
 —honours, offices, silver, gold, possessions, different forms and colours, beautiful objects. And whenever you meet with these, do as a good artist does, and engrave upon the material substances a form as good as possible, and thus accomplish a work which may win men’s praise.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="27"><p> You know well how, when

an unskilled man takes charge of a vessel that is quite capable of making a safe voyage, he upsets it, whereas a skilled helmsman often saves one which


<pb n="25"/>

is sinking; and how sick folk, under the care of inexperienced attendants, fall into a dangerous condition of body, while those who meet with experienced attendants recover even from angerous diseases. I need not labour the point. It is invariably the case that what is done with skill shews up and convicts what is done without it, and true praise accorded to the one is sure condemnation of the other.

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="28"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="5"/> If, then, you desire

thoroughly to expose the worthless man of wealth, do not refuse abundance of wealth. He, miserable creature, will be seen in his true colours, either with the instincts of a slave rather than a gentleman, a skinflint and a splitpenny; or on the other hand as living in a whirl of prodigality, ever ready to fling away money and to guzzle—an ever-active patron of courtesans, pimps, panders, and every licentious crew.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="29"><p> You will contribute freely to needy friends,

will make bountiful gifts to serve your country’s wants, you will help parents without means to marry their daughters, and provide them with an ample dowry;</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="30"><p> you will all but throw your private property into the common stock and invite all deserving of kindness to take a share.In exactly the

same way, when someone is crazy after fame and full of boastfulness, if you wish to cast reproach on the sorry fellow, do not turn your back upon popular applause if you have an opportunity of winning honour, and then, while the poor braggart strides conceitedly along, you will send him tumbling. While he will misuse his distinguished position to insult and disgrace others better than himself, and will exalt worse men above them, you on the other hand will make all worthy men sharers in the advantages

<pb n="27"/>

of your good name, securing the position of the better kind, and improving the worse by your counsel.Again, if you go to a luxurious</p></div><div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="31"><p>

repast where the wine flow’s freely, go without hesitation; for you will put the intemperate man to shame by having yourself well in hand.
<note n="5.27.a">Or “good behaviour.” See App. p. 583.</note>
  He will fall upon his belly and open his insatiable appetites before he opens his mouth, cram himself in unseemly fashion, grab at his next neighbour’s food, and gobble up everything without a blush; and when he is thoroughly sated with eating, he will as the poets say “drink with a yawning maw,”
<note n="5.27.b"><hi rend="italic">Odyssey</hi> xxi. 294: οἶνός σε τρώει μελιηδής, ὅς τε καὶ ἄλλους βλάπτει, ὃς ἄν μιν χανδὸν ἔλῃ μηδ᾿ αἴσιμα πίνῃ.</note>
  and incur the mocking and ridicule of all who see him.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="32"><p> But you,

when there is no compulsion, will drink in moderation; and should you be forced in any case to indulge more freely, you will place the compulsion under the charge of reason, and never debase pleasure to the displeasure of others, but, if we may so speak, get soberly drunken.
<note n="5.27.c">For the milder sense carried by μεθύειν see Introduction to <hi rend="italic">De Plant</hi>. Vol. III. p. 209, where St. John ii. 10 ὅταν μεθυσθῶσι (R.V. “have drunk freely”) was quoted.</note>


</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="33"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="6"/> Truth would therefore

rightly find fault with those who without full consideration give up the business and financial side of a citizen’s life, and say that they have conceived a contempt for fame and pleasure. For they do not despise these things, they are practising an imposture. Their dirty bodies and gloomy faces, the rigour and squalour of their pinched life, are so many baits to lead others to regard them as lovers of orderliness and temperance and endurance.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="34"><p> But they are

unable to deceive the more sharp-sighted, who peer inside and refuse to be taken in by what meets the eye. For they thrust this back as mere screening


<pb n="29"/>

of quite different things, and get a view of the true nature of the things concealed within, which, if they are beautiful, they admire, but if ugly, ridicule and loathe them for their hypocrisy.To such</p></div><div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="35"><p>

men, then, let us say: Do you affect the life that eschews social intercourse with others, and courts solitary loneliness? Well, what proof did you ever give before this of noble social qualities? Do you renounce money-making? When engaged in business, were you determined to be just in your dealings? Would you make a show of paying no regard to the pleasures of the belly and the parts below it—say, when you had abundant material for indulging in these, did you exercise moderation? Do you despise popular esteem? Well, when you held posts of honour, did you practise simplicity? State business is an object of ridicule to you people.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="36"><p> Perhaps you have never discovered how serviceable a thing it is.Begin, then, by getting some exercise

and practice in the business of life both private and public; and when by means of the sister virtues, household-management and statesmanship, you have become masters in each domain, enter now, as more than qualified to do so, on your migration to a different and more excellent way of life. For the practical comes before the contemplative life; it is a sort of prelude to a more advanced contest; and it is well to have fought it out first.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="37"><p> By taking this course you will avoid the imputation of shrinking from it through sheer laziness.It was

on this principle too that the Levites were charged to perform their active service until the age of fifty (Numb. iv. 3 ff.), but, when released from their practical ministry, to make everything an object of

<pb n="31"/>

observation and contemplation;</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="38"><p> receiving as a prize for duty well done in the active life a quite different way of life whose delight is in knowledge and study of principles alone.And apart from this,

it is a vital matter that those who venture to make the claims of God their aim and study should first have fully met those of men; for it is sheer folly to suppose that you will reach the greater while you are incapable of mastering the lesser. Therefore first make yourselves familiar with virtue as exercised in our dealings with men, to the end that you may be introduced to that also which has to do with our relation to God.

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="39"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="7"/> Such is the substance of the advice which

Patience gives to the Man of Practice, but the actual words need detailed treatment. “Behold,” she says, “Esau thy brother is threatening thee.” Is it not the case that the character which is hard and wooden, whose ignorance makes it disobedient, the character called “Esau,” nurses a grudge, and, offering the baits of this mortal life to destroy thee, money, fame, pleasures, and the like, is bent on killing thee? “But do thou, my child, flee from the present contest: for not yet has thy strength reached its full development, but, as is natural in a boy, the sinews of thy soul lack firmness.”</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="40"><p> This is why she addressed

him as “child,” a title at the same time expressive of kindly feeling and suited to a tender age; for we regard the character of the Practiser both as young compared with the fully developed and as lovable. Such a one is quite capable of winning the prizes that are offered to boys, but is not as yet able to carry off those offered to men; and the best prize that men can obtain, is to minister to the only God.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="41"><p> So, when

we present ourselves at the courts in which we are

<pb n="33"/>

to minister not yet thoroughly purified, but having just washed off, as we think, the spots which smirch our life, we hurry away from that ministry more quickly than we came to it, not brooking its severe way of living, and the unsleeping observance and the continuous and unflagging toil which it demands.Flee, then, at present both that which</p></div><div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="42"><p>

is worst, and that which is best. Worst is the fabulous fiction,
<note n="5.33.a"><hi rend="italic">Cf. De Cong.</hi> 61, 62 and note.</note>
  the poem without metre or melody, the conception and persuasion
<note n="5.33.b">Or perhaps “confidence.” See App. p. 583.</note>
  which ignorance has rendered hard and wooden in very deed. From this Esau derives his name. Best is the dedicated offering; for the ministering kind is a sacred offering to God, consecrated for the great high priesthood to Him alone.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="43"><p> To spend one’s days with evil is most hurtful:

to do so with perfect goodness most dangerous. So Jacob both flees from Esau and moves away from his parents; for being bent on practice and still engaged in a contest, he flies from evil, but is incapable of sharing the life of perfect virtue that learns untaught.

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="44"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="8"/> Consequently he will go abroad to Laban, not

the Syrian, but his mother’s brother. This means that he will arrive amid the splendours of life, for “Laban” signifies “bright.” And when he has arrived, he will not be elated by his good fortune and have a lofty mien; for, though “aloft” is the translation of “Syrian,” there is no mention here of the Syrian Laban, but only of the brother of Rebecca.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="45"><p> For the

ways and means of life placed at the disposal of a worthless man carry his mind up into the height, empty as it is of sound sense, and such a mind is called “Syrian,” but for the man enamoured of discipline,
steadfastly and firmly persisting in the principles


<pb n="35"/>

of nobility of character . . . this is the brother of Rebecca, or “Persistence”; and he dwells in “Haran,” which in our language is “cavities,” a symbol of the senses;</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="57"><p> Indeed he evidently ascribes immortality to the former by adding “ye are alive ‘to-day,’” Now “to-day”

is the limitless age that never comes to an end; for periods of months and years, and of lengths of time generally, are notions of men arising from the high importance which they have attached to number. But the absolutely correct name for “endless age”
<note n="5.41.a">Or “eternity,” but there is not here that opposition between time and eternity which we sometimes have in Philo, <hi rend="italic">e.g. Quod Deus</hi> 32. Perhaps “the ages” is the best English equivalent.</note>

<note n="5.41.b">The thought is not very clear. Perhaps “the sun measures time by its presence and absence.

oracle by which she verified her statement was this: “Behold, I have given before thy face life and death, good and evil “(Deut. xxx. 15). Accordingly, thou wisest of teachers, goodness and virtue is life, evil and wickedness is death. Again, elsewhere: “This is thy life and length of days, to love the Lord thy God” (Deut. xxx. 20).

<note n="5.43.b">The real meaning of the text no doubt is “He set a sign upon Cain, in order that no one should kill him.” But the fuller discussion of the text in <hi rend="italic">Quod Det.</hi> 177 shows that Philo, with little respect for grammar, takes it as in the translation, viz. that the distinctive mark of the Cain-soul is that it can never be killed.</note>

adherence to the same principle he ascribes the blessing of the good and the cursing of the guilty to different persons.

Therefore of those appointed for this purpose, the chiefs of the race, twelve in number, whom we are accustomed to call tribe-leaders, he set the six best over the blessing, Symeon, Levi, Judah, Issachar, Joseph and Benjamin; and the other six over the cursing, the first and the last of the sons of Leah, Reuben and Zabulon, and the four bastard-born of

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="76"><p> It is lawful, therefore, for one

<note n="5.51.c">i.e. Philo takes the “thee” of the text to be the Logos.</note>
  which shews that the dweller in the place is a different person from him who escapes thither. For to His Word, as to one indigenous, God has given His knowledge as a fatherland to dwell in, but to one who has fallen into unintentional offences He has given it as a place of refuge, as a strange land to an alien, not as a fatherland to one with a citizen’s rights.

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="78"><p> 5). And is it not life eternal to take refuge with Him

that Is, and death to flee away from Him? But if a man sets upon another he certainly deliberately commits a wrong, and that which is done intentionally with guile incurs guilt, even as, on the other hand, no blame attaches to the act in which there is no guile.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="79"><p> Accordingly it is not right to say that any wrongs

committed with secret hostility and with guile and as the result of premeditation are done as God ordains; they are done as we ordain. For as I have said, the treasuries of evil things are in ourselves; with God are those of good things only.</p></div>

  They are four in number: first, why cities set apart for fugitives were chosen, not from the cities allotted to the other tribes, but from those assigned to the tribe of Levi only; secondly, for what reason they were six in number, and neither more nor less; thirdly, why three were beyond the Jordan, and the others in the land of Canaan; fourthly, why the time appointed beforehand for the return of the fugitives was the death of the High Priest.On each of these points we must say what is pertinent,

beginning with the first. The direction to fly to the cities allotted to Levites only is wholly appropriate, for the Levites too are in a certain sense fugitives, having, for the sake of being well-pleasing to God, forsaken parents and children and brothers and all their mortal kindred.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="90"><p> It is on the ground, then, of a similarity in their doings that the Lawgiver commits fugitives to the keeping of fugitives, that they may obtain an amnesty for what they had done.Was

this, then, the only reason, or was it also because the Tribe of Levi, consisting of those who had the care of the Tabernacle, rushed upon and slew from the young upwards

  those who fashioned into a god the golden calf, the Egyptian folly? They did this under the impulse of righteous anger accompanied by an inspiration from above and a God-sent possession: “And each man slays brother and neighbour and his nearest” (Exod. xxxii. 27), for the body is “brother” of the soul, the irrational part of us neighbour of the rational, and the word of utterance “next of kin” to mind.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="91"><p> For in this way only could

those which have been mentioned, is that the Tribe of Levi is that of ministers of the Tabernacle and priests, on whom rests the service of the Sanctuary, and those who commit unintentional homicide are also engaged in a service, since, as Moses tells us, “God delivers into their hands” (Exod. xxi. 13) for destruction those that have done deeds worthy of death. But, while the Levites were appointed for the exaltation of the good, these others were appointed for the chastisement of the guilty.

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="100"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="19"/> Such are the six cities, which

Moses calls “places of refuge” (Num. xxxv. 12), five of which were represented by symbolic figures which are in the sanctuary, the Laws laid up in the ark being symbols of injunction and prohibition; the lid of the ark, which he calls the Mercy-seat, representing the gracious power; while the creative and kingly powers are represented by the winged Cherubim that rest upon it.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="101"><p> The Divine Word, Who is

proposed for consideration was the time prescribed for the return of the fugitives, namely, that of the death of the High Priest. If taken literally, this point presents, I feel, great difficulty.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="107"><p> The penalty inflicted by law on those whose offences are identical is unequal, if some are to be fugitives for a longer, some for a shorter, period; for of the High Priests some are very long-lived, some the reverse; some are

appointed in youth, some in old age; and of those guilty of unintentional homicide some went into exile



<pb n="69"/>

at the outset of the High Priest’s priesthood, some when the holder of the sacred office was nearing his end.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="108"><p> Thus some have been cut off from their native place for a very long time indeed, others merely for a day, it may be, after which they will arrive with their heads in the air, insolently laughing at the nearest relatives of those whom they have slain.Let us, then, have recourse to the scientific mode of

interpretation which looks for the hidden meaning of the literal words, and we shall escape from the difficulty and be able to give a reasonable account of the matter. We say, then, that the High Priest is not a man, but a Divine Word and immune from all unrighteousness whether intentional or unintentional.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="109"><p> For Moses says that he cannot defile himself either

for
<note n="5.69.a">Or “with,” “through,” as Philo understands the preposition. The meaning of the original is that as contact with a corpse entails defilement, the priests are only to touch the bodies of their nearest of kin (Lev. xxi. 2), but the High Priest not even these. Philo’s allegory understands it to mean that with the ordinary man both father mind and mother sense may cause defilement, but the Logos is of other parentage.</note>
  the father, the mind, nor for the mother, sense-perception (Lev. xxi.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="110"><p> 11), because, methinks, he is the child of parents incorruptible and wholly free from stain, his father being God, who is likewise Father of all, and his mother Wisdom, through whom the universe came into existence; because, moreover,

his head has been anointed with oil, and by this I mean that his ruling faculty is illumined with a brilliant light, in such wise that he is deemed worthy “to put on the garments.” Now the garments which the supreme Word of Him that is puts on as raiment are the world, for He arrays Himself in earth and air and water and fire and all that comes forth from these; while the body is the clothing of the soul considered as the principle of physical life,
<note n="5.69.b">Or “the soul in the partial sense,” i.e. excluding the “ruling principle”; <hi rend="italic">cf. De Op</hi>. 117 τῆς ἡμετέρας ψυχῆς τὸ δίχα τοῦ ἡγεμονικοῦ μέρος.</note>
  and the virtues of the wise man’s understanding.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="111"><p> Moses

also says that “he shall never remove the mitre”

from his head; he shall not, that is to say, lay aside the kingly diadem, the symbol not of absolute sovereignty, but of an admirable viceroyalty; “nor” again “shall he rend his clothes” (Lev. xxi.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="112"><p> 10); for

the Word of Him that Is is, as has been stated, the bond of all existence, and holds and knits together all the parts, preventing them from being dissolved and separated; just as the principle of physical life, in so far as it has been endowed with power, suffers none of the parts of the body to be split or cut off contrary to nature, but, so far as in it lies, all the parts are complete, and maintain unbroken a mutual harmony and oneness; and, in like manner, the purified mind of the wise man preserves the virtues free from breach or hurt, linking in a yet firmer concord the affinity and fellowship which is theirs by nature.

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="113"><p><milestone unit="para"/>XXI The High Priest, so Moses says,

“shall not go in to any dead soul” (Lev. xxi. 11). Death of soul is a life in the company of vice, so that what is meant is that he is never to come in contact with any polluting object, and of these folly always stinks.</p></div>

For hateful to him is widowhood from virtue, and the plight of one cast out and driven from her doors, and any conviction that is profane and unholy. But the promiscuous,


<pb n="73"/>

polyandrous cause of polytheism, or rather atheism, the harlot, he deigns not even to look at, having learned to love her who had adopted, as her one Husband and Father, God the All-sovereign.In this character we see perfection in something like</p></div><div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="115"><p>

its highest form. On the other hand, as to the man who has vowed the Great Vow, the lawgiver seems to recognize that he does stumble unintentionally, even if not with deliberate intent; for he says, “If one die by him suddenly, he shall at once be defiled” (Num. vi. 9): for that which suddenly swoops down upon us from without, apart from any wish of our own, defiles the soul at once, though not for an interminable period, owing to its being unintentional.</p></div>

  But with such involuntary defilements, even as with those that are voluntary, the High Priest has no concern, but stands far up beyond their reach.The observations which I have been making are

not beside the mark, but are meant to shew that the fixing of the High Priest’s death as the term for the return of the exiles is in perfect accordance with the natural fitness of things (Num. xxxv.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="117"><p> 25). For so long as this holiest Word is alive and is still

present in the soul, it is out of the question that an unintentional offence should come back into it; for this holy Word is by nature incapable of taking part in and of admitting to itself any sin whatever. But if the Word die, not by being itself destroyed, but by being withdrawn out of our soul, the way is at once open for the return of unintentional errors; for if it was abiding within us alive and well when they were




<pb n="75"/>

removed, assuredly when it departs and goes elsewhere they will be reinstated.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="118"><p> For the Monitor, the

undefiled High Priest, enjoys as the fruit of his nature the special prerogative of never admitting into himself any uncertainty of judgement. Wherefore it is meet that we should pray that He who is at once High Priest and King may live in our soul as Monitor on the seat of justice, seeing that he has received for his proper sphere the entire court of our understanding, and faces unabashed all who are brought up for judgement there.
<note n="5.75.a">The interpretation of §§ 116-118 does not seem to be in keeping with what has gone before.

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="120"><p> 7)—the angel who decreed a return home to a soul whose shame was like to lead into wandering, and well-nigh was its escort back to the frame of mind which wanders not.It will be an advantage

that the lawgiver’s reflections about finding and seeking should not be passed over.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="121"><p> He represents some as neither seeking nor finding anything, others as succeeding in both, some as having mastered one but not the other, either seeking and not finding, or finding without having sought.Those with

no desire either to find or to seek grievously impair their faculty of reason, by refusing to train and exercise it, and, though capable of being keen-sighted, become blind. This is his meaning when he says that


<pb n="77"/>

“Lot’s wife turned backwards and became a pillar” (Gen. xix. 26), and here he is not inventing a fable but indicating precisely a real fact.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="122"><p> For a man who

is led by innate and habitual laziness to pay no attention to his teacher neglects what lies in front of him, which would enable him to see and hear and use his other faculties for the observation of nature’s facts.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="123"><p> Instead he twists
<note n="5.77.a">Or “(almost) dislocates.”</note>
  his neck and turns his face backwards, and his thoughts are all for the dark and hidden side—of life, that is, not of the body and its parts, and so he turns into a pillar and becomes like a deaf and lifeless stone.Speaking of

such characters as these Moses says that they did not get “a heart to understand, and eyes to see, and ears to hear” (Deut. xxix. 4), but wrought out for themselves a life that was no life, blind and deaf and unintelligent and in every way maimed, setting themselves to nothing that demands their thoughts.

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="124"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="23"/> As leader of this company we see the king of

lifeless company of such men as these, and scan well that of those who practise looking and finding. Our


<pb n="79"/>

first example shall be the man who takes part indeed in public life, but is very far from having a mad thirst for fame: his ambition is for that better family, which the virtues have taken as their heritage, and he is represented as both seeking and finding it.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="127"><p> For

we are told that “a man found Joseph wandering in the plain, and asked him, ‘What art thou seeking?’ and he said ‘I am seeking my brethren; tell me, where are they feeding their flocks?’ And the man said to him, ‘They have departed hence, for I heard them saying, Let us go to Dothan.’ And Joseph went his way after his brethren, and found them in Dothan” (Gen. xxxvii.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="128"><p> 15–17). Dothan means “a thorough forsaking,”

and is the symbol of a soul that has in no half measure but completely run away from those empty notions which resemble the practices of women rather than those of men. Accordingly it is finely said that Sarah, who is Virtue, “forsakes the ways of women” (Gen. xviii. 11), those ways on which we toil who follow after the unmanly and really feminine life. But the wise man too “forsaking is added” (Gen. xxv. 8),
<note n="5.79.a">E.V. “gave up the ghost . . . and was gathered (to his people).” <hi rend="italic">Cf. De Sac.</hi> 5.</note>
  as Moses says in perfect accord with the nature of things: for the subtraction of vainglory is the addition of reality.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="129"><p> If a man, while spending his

days in this mortal life full of such diverse elements and assuming so many phases, and while he has at his disposal abundant material for a life of luxury, makes that better family, which has an eye only for what is morally excellent, his study and quest, he is worthy of approbation, if the dreams and phantoms of things that have the name and appearance of good things do not rise to the surface again and get the better of him.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="130"><p> For if he continues in that soul

two whom I hold in great admiration. One is full of curiosity about the middle term between two others, and says, “Lo, the fire and the wood; where is the sheep for a whole burnt-offering?” The other replies, “God will see for Himself a sheep for a whole burnt-offering, Child”; and afterwards finds the substitute provided, for “behold a single ram held by the horns in a Sabek shrub”
<note n="5.81.b">E.V. “thicket.” “Sabek” is a translation of the Hebrew word for thicket, which the LXX apparently took for the name of a plant.</note>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="133"><p> 7, 8, 13). Let us see, then, what the inquirer’s difficulty is, and

what the answerer declares; and in the third place what the thing found was.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="134"><p> Well, the inquiry he makes is of this kind: “Behold, the efficient cause, the fire; behold also, the passive object, the material, the wood; where is the third term, the finished result
<note n="5.81.c">Or “the thing effected.”</note>
 ?” As though he should say, “Behold the

  all warm and on fire; behold also the objects which the mind perceives, materials, as it were; where is the third term, the mind’s perception? “Or once more, “Here is sight; here is colour; where is the seeing?” and, quite generally, “Lo, here is sense-perception, the instrument for forming judgements; yes, and the objects of sense-perception, the material for it to work upon; where,

<pb n="83"/>

then, is the act of perceiving?”
</p></div><div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="135"><p>

To these inquiries

the other gives the only right answer, “God will see for Himself”; for the third term is God’s special work. For it is by His taking thought for them that the mind apprehends, and sight sees, and every sense perceives.As for the words “A ram is found held fast,” this is reason keeping quiet and in suspense.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="136"><p> For the best offering is quietness and suspense

of judgement, in matters that absolutely lack proofs. The only word we may say is this, “God will see.” To Him all things are known; He sees all things distinctly, by clearest light, even by Himself.

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="137"><p> When they sought what

it is that nourished the soul (for, as Moses says, “they knew not what it was”) (Exod. xvi. 15), they became learners and found it to be a saying of God, that is the Divine Word, from which all kinds of instruction and wisdom flow in perpetual stream.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="138"><p> This is the heavenly nourishment, and it is indicated as such in the sacred records, when the First Cause in his own person says, “Lo, it is I that am raining upon you bread out of the heaven” (<hi rend="italic">ibid</hi>. 4); for in very deed

God drops from above the ethereal wisdom upon minds which are by nature apt and take delight in Contemplation; and they see it and taste it and are filled with pleasure, being fully aware of what they feel, but wholly ignorant of the cause which produced the feeling. So they inquire “What is this” (<hi rend="italic">ibid</hi>. 15) which has a nature making it sweeter than honey and whiter than snow? And they will be taught by

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="140"><p><milestone unit="para"/>A seeker also was the prophet himself, to know

the cause of successful achievement, and he found that it was the presence with him of the only God. For when he asked in doubt, “Who am I, and what is there in me that I should deliver the race of vision from the character which fancies itself king and sets itself up against God?” he is instructed by a message from God, “I will be with thee” (Exod. iii.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="141"><p> 11 f.). It is true, of course, that the seeking of partial and

subordinate objects calls out in us the exercise of delicate and profound thought; but the seeking of God, best of all existences, incomparable Cause of all things, gladdens us the moment we begin our search, and never turns out fruitless, since by reason of His gracious nature He comes to meet us with His pure and virgin graces, and shews Himself to those who yearn to see Him, not as He is, which is a thing impossible, since even Moses “turned away his face, for he was afraid to look upon God” (Exod. iii. 6), but so far as it was allowable that created nature should direct its gaze towards the Power that is beyond conception.</p></div>

now, that men having conceived the desire to become kings instead of gate-keepers and to overthrow order, the most beautiful thing in human life, have not only failed of the success which they had unjustly hoped for, but have been compelled to part with the advantage which they held in their hands.

  The first of

these he made against the Egyptian character, which was assailing the soul from the vantage-ground of pleasure; for “after smiting him he covered him with sand” (Exod. ii. 12), a drifting, disconnected substance. He evidently regarded both doctrines as having the same author, the doctrine that pleasure is the prime and greatest good, and the doctrine that atoms are the elementary principles of the universe. Another attack (<hi rend="italic">ibid</hi>. 13) was directed against him who splits up the nature of good into subdivisions, and assigns one to soul, one to body, one to things outside us. For he would have the good to be a complete whole, apportioned to the best element in us, to understanding alone, and in agreement with nothing lifeless.

nature of things that invincible Virtue, bitterly vexed at men’s absurd aims—Tamar is her name—is not found by the messenger dispatched to seek her; for it is said, “And Judah sent the kid of the goats by the hand of his shepherd the Adullamite, to receive the pledge from the woman’s hand: and he found her not. And he asked the men of the place,


<pb n="91"/>

‘Where is the harlot that was at Enaim by the wayside?’ And they said, ‘There was no harlot here.’ And he returned to Judah and said, ‘I have not found her, and the men of the place say that there is no harlot here.’ And Judah said ‘Let her have them, but let us never be laughed to scorn; I have sent this kid, and thou hast not found her’” (Gen. xxxviii. 20–23). O admirable assay! O sacred test!</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="150"><p> A mind,

bent on purchasing that fairest possession, piety, gave a pledge in the form of three securities or symbols, a signet ring, a cord, a staff (<hi rend="italic">ibid</hi>. 18): the first, steadfastness and fidelity; the second, sequence and correspondence of word with life and life with word; the third, straight and unbending discipline, on which it is an advantage to lean.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="151"><p>
<note n="5.91.a">See App. p. 585.</note>
  The mind is putting

to the test whether it did well to give this pledge. What, then, is the test? To drop some bait possessed of attractive power, fame or riches or health of body, or something of this kind, and to ascertain towards which side it sinks as on a pair of scales; for should there be an inclination towards any of these, the pledge is not safe. So he sent the kid thus to recover the pledge from the woman, not with the purpose of getting it back in any case, but only if she should ever prove unworthy to retain it.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="152"><p> When

will she be proved such? Whenever she exchanges things that matter for things that do not, preferring counterfeits to genuine goods.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="153"><p> Now genuine goods are fidelity, sequence and correspondence of words with acts, a standard of right discipline (as on the other hand evils are faithlessness, inconsistency, lack of discipline); while the counterfeits are all things that depend upon irrational impulse.He



<pb n="93"/>

sought there and “did not find her”; for that which is morally excellent is hard or even impossible to find in a life of turmoil.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="154"><p> And if he make careful inquiries whether there be in all the region of that which is morally excellent a soul that has played the harlot, he will be told definitely that there neither is nor was aforetime, for that there is not there any licentious one, or a wanton, or a street-walker, or one prostituting for gain the flower of her youth, or making bright what is outside by baths and cleansings while she is foul within, or in default of natural beauty painting her face as pictures are coloured, or what is called the “many-husband” pest, following after evil as though it were good, or a lover of polygamy, or dispersing herself upon a thousand different objects material and immaterial alike, or mocked and outraged by that multitude.He who had sent the

messenger, on hearing this, being one who had put envy far from him and was of a gracious disposition, rejoices greatly and says: “Is it not my heart-felt prayer that my understanding should be a true and high-born lady,
<note n="5.93.a">The allegory seems to get a little confused at this point. Properly the mind is the purchaser of the lady Virtue or Piety.</note>
  eminent for chastity and modesty and all other virtues, devoted to one husband and keeping watch with delight over the home of one, and exulting in a sole ruler? If in truth she is such an one, let her keep the things which have been given her, both discipline and the correspondence of word with life and of life with word, and the most vital of all, steadfastness and fidelity.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="155"><p> But let us

never be laughed to scorn in the belief that we


<pb n="95"/>

thought our gifts unmerited;
<note n="5.95.a">Or “of little value.” Philo interprets the LXX “Let her have them (i.e. the pledges), but let us never be laughed to scorn” as meaning that to suppose that the material gift of the kid should be taken in exchange for the spiritual, would expose the offerer to the charge that he thought the latter of little value (or perhaps unduly depreciated the soul to which the offer is made). It is not so. The offer is the test which every aspiring soul must put to itself.</note>
  we did indeed suppose that they were presents perfectly adapted to the soul. But while I, on my part, did what one who wished to test and try a character would naturally do, when I offered a bait, and sent a messenger, that character on its part made it evident that it was by its nature no easy prey.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="156"><p> But I could not tell what it is

which makes one an easy prey and another not; for I have seen great numbers of the exceedingly wicked sometimes acting exactly like the very good, but not for the same reason, since one set is putting truth into practice, the other set hypocrisy: and it is hard to distinguish these two; for many a time being is outdone by seeming.”

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="157"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="28"/> Again, the goat of the sin-offering is

sought for by the lover of virtue, but he does not find it; for, as the passage of Holy Writ shews, it had already been burnt (Lev. x. 16). We must consider what he means by this figure. To do no sin is peculiar to God; to repent, to the wise man; and this latter is a very difficult thing, and hard to find.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="158"><p> So the oracle says that “Moses diligently sought”

in this mortal life the secret of repentance for sins; for he was intent on discovering a soul divesting itself of unrighteousness, and going forth without shame, naked of misdeeds. But nevertheless he did not find one, for the flame, in other words the irrational impulse

It might perhaps be suggested that the scorn is Tamar’s, and the gift scorned the kid, and this is supported by the description of her in § 149. But it is difficult to fit this in with the rest of the sentence.

exceeding swift in its movements, had overrun and devoured the whole soul.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="159"><p> For the fewer are over-powered

by the more numerous, and the slower by the more fleet, and things that tarry by things that are present; and repentance is a restricted and slow and tarrying thing, whereas wrongdoing is copious and swift and constantly present in this mortal life. Naturally, then, one who has come into a state of lapse from virtue says that he is “unable to eat of the sin-offering,” since his inward feeling does not permit him to be fed by repentance, wherefore it is said “Moses heard it, and it pleased him” (Lev. x.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="160"><p> 19 f.). For our

relation to other created beings is a very different thing from our relation to God; for to creation only things manifest are known, but to God hidden things also. The man who, lying against the truth, maintains while still doing wrong that he has repented, is a madman. It is just as if the sick man were to act the part of the healthy man: he will clearly get worse through declining to have recourse to any means conducive to health.
<note n="5.97.a">The main point of the story of Lev. x. 16-20, some of the details of which seem to be difficult, is that the goat should have been eaten by the priests instead of being burnt. Aaron pleaded in defence “there have befallen me such things as these,” i.e. the death of his sons Nadab and Abihu. “In spite of the sacrifice offered on behalf of Aaron and his house, two of his sons have perished; with such a token of the divine displeasure resting upon him could he, immediately afterwards, feel himself entitled to eat the sacrifice?” (Driver). Philo interprets the goat as Repentance, which is consumed by the fire of unreasoning appetite, and therefore “not found”; and to eat of it and thus to assume a repentance which is not sincere will make the sinner’s condition worse.</note>


</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="161"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="29"/> Again, on one occasion the prophet, led on

by his love of acquiring knowledge, was seeking after the causes by which the most essential occurrences in the universe are brought about; for observing all created things wasting away and coming to the birth, perishing and yet remaining, he is smitten with amazement and cries out saying, “Why is it that the bush


<pb n="99"/>

is burning and not being consumed?” (Exod. iii.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="162"><p> 2 f.), for his thoughts are busy over the untrodden place,

familiar only to Divine natures. But when now on the point of engaging in an endless and futile labour, he is relieved of it by the kindness and providence of God the Saviour of all men, who from out of the hallowed spot warned him “Draw not nigh hither” (<hi rend="italic">ibid</hi>. 5), as much as to say “Enter not on such an inquiry”; for the task argues a busy, restless curiosity too great for human ability: marvel at all that has come into being, but as for the reasons for which they have either come into being or are decaying, cease to busy thyself with them.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="163"><p> For “the place on which

thou standest is holy ground,” it says (<hi rend="italic">ibid</hi>. 5). What kind of place or topic is meant?</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="164"><p> Evidently that of causation, a subject which He has assigned to Divine natures only, deeming no human being capable of dealing with the study of causation.But the prophet owing to desire of knowledge lifts

his eyes above the whole universe and becomes a seeker regarding its Creator, asking of what sort this Being is so difficult to see, so difficult to conjecture. Is He a body or incorporeal, or something exalted above these? Is He a single Nature, a Monad as it were? Or a composite Being? What among all that exists? And seeing that this is a problem hard to pursue, hard to take in by thought, he prays that he may learn from God Himself what God is: for he had no hope of being able to ascertain this from another, from one of those that are inferior to Him.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="165"><p> Nevertheless he did not succeed in finding anything

by search respecting the essence of Him that is. For



<pb n="101"/>

he is told “What is behind Me thou shalt see, but My face thou shalt by no means see” (Exod. xxxiii. 23). For it amply suffices the wise man to come to a knowledge of all that follows on after God and in His wake, but the man that wishes to set his gaze upon the Supreme Essence, before he sees Him will be blinded by the rays that beam forth all around Him.

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="166"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="30"/> Having said thus much about the third

head also, we will go on to the fourth and last of those proposed for consideration, in which there has been no “seeking,” and yet “finding” meets us unbidden. Under this head is ranged every wise man who learns directly from no teacher but himself; for he does not by searchings and practisings and toilings gain improvement, but as soon as he comes into existence he finds wisdom placed ready to his hand, shed from heaven above, and of this he drinks undiluted draughts, and sits feasting, and ceases not to be drunken with the sober drunkenness which right reason brings.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="167"><p> This is he whom Holy Writ

calls “Isaac,” whom the soul did not conceive at one time and give birth to at another, for it says “she conceived and gave birth” (Gen. xxi. 2) as though timelessly. For he that was thus born was not a man, but a most pure thought, beautiful not by practice but by nature. And for this reason she that gave birth to it is said “to have forsaken the ways of women” (Gen. xviii. 11), those human ways of custom and mere reasoning.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="168"><p> For the nature of

the self-taught is new and higher than our reasoning, and in very deed Divine, arising by no human will or purpose but by a God-inspired ecstasy. Do you not know that Hebrew mothers need no midwives for their delivery, but as Moses says “before the midwives”

<pb n="103"/>

(Exod. i. 19), that is before systems, arts, sciences, come in, they give birth with the co-operation of nature alone?Admirable and most suitable are the marks which the Lawgiver sets forth to define the direct learner: one, “that which is quickly found,” another, “that which God delivered.”</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="169"><p> While that which is taught needs a long

time, that which comes by nature is rapid, and, we may say, timeless; and, while the one has man as teacher, the other has God. The former mark he sets down in a question: “What is this which thou didst find quickly, Child?” the other in a reply, in the words “that which God the Lord delivered” (Gen. xxvii. 20).

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="170"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="31"/> There is besides

a third mark of the direct learner, namely that which comes up of itself. For it is said in the Exhortations
<note n="5.103.a">Since in the other six places where Philo uses the phrase the quotation comes from Deuteronomy, it is perhaps more probable that here also he thinks he is quoting that book.</note>
 : “Ye shall not sow, nor shall ye reap its growths that come up of themselves” (Lev. xxv. 11): for natural growths require no artificial treatment, since God sows them and by His art of husbandry brings to perfection, as though they were self-grown, plants which are not self-grown, save only so far as they had no need whatever of human attention.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="171"><p> His

words are not those of exhortation, but of statement
<note n="5.103.b">Or, more fully, “statement of what he thinks (will happen).” For this argument from the indicative form of the words <hi rend="italic">cf. De Ebr</hi>. 138.</note>
 : for, in commanding, he would have said “do not sow,” “do not reap”; instead he says in the form of a statement, “Ye shall not sow, nor assuredly shall ye reap that which is self-grown.” For when we observe such growths as spring up spontaneously by nature, we find that we are not responsible either for their beginning or their end. Now the seed is


<pb n="105"/>

the beginning and the reaping the end;</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="172"><p> and the

text is better understood in this way: every beginning and every end is “automatic,” in the sense that it is not our doing but that of nature.
<note n="5.105.a">The connexion of thought seems to be as follows: to say that we shall not sow or reap (in the sense of bringing to the harvest) self-grown plants is a truism. Sowing must mean “beginning” and reaping “ending” and the text is intended to teach us that all our actions begin and end from God.</note>
  For instance, what is the beginning of the act of learning? Evidently it is the nature residing in the pupil with its receptivity towards the several subjects of study. What again is the beginning of the completion of learning? Undoubtedly it is nature.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="173"><p> It is within the power of the teacher to lead us from one stage of progress to another; God only, Nature at its best, can produce in us the full completion.The man that is nurtured on these doctrines enjoys

the peace that never ends, released from unabating toils. Peace and Seven are identical according to the Legislator: for on the seventh day
<note n="5.105.b">Or “the seventh (anything).” See note on <hi rend="italic">De Mut</hi>. 260. Philo clearly has the sabbatical year in mind as well as the sabbath itself.</note>
  creation puts away its seeming activity and takes rest.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="174"><p> So, taken

in a symbolic sense, the words “And the sabbath of the land shall be food for you” (Lev. xxv. 6) are to the point; for nothing is nourishing and enjoyable food, save rest in God, securing as it does for us the greatest boon, the peace which is unbroken by war.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="175"><p> For the peace which is made by one city with another is mixed with and marred by intestine war; but the peace of the soul has no admixture of discord whatever.But it is by the following that the

Lawgiver seems to me most clearly to supply an example of finding without seeking: “When the Lord thy God shall have led thee into the land which He sware unto thy fathers to give thee, cities great



<pb n="107"/>

and fair, which thou buildedst not, houses full of all good things, which thou filledst not, cisterns cut out, which thou cuttedst not, vineyards and olive-yards, which thou plantedst not” (Deut. vi.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="176"><p> 10 f.). Seest

thou the lavish abundance of the good things showered upon them, great and ready for possession and enjoyment? The generic virtues are likened to cities, because they have the greatest expanse; the special virtues to houses, for these are restricted to a narrower compass; souls endowed with good native ability are likened to cisterns, being ready to receive wisdom as these do water; vineyards and olive-yards represent progress and growth and yield of fruits; and the fruit of knowledge is the life of contemplation, winning for us unmixed gladness as from wine, and intellectual light as from a flame which oil feeds.

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="177"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="32"/> In what preceded we have spoken about

finding, having previously dealt with flight. We will now pass on in turn to the points which follow next in our plan of treatment. We read, then, “An angel of the Lord found her at the water-spring”
(Gen. xvi. 7). “Spring” is a word used in many senses. In the first place, our mind is so called; secondly, the reasoning habit
<note n="5.107.b">See App. p. 585.</note>
  and education; thirdly, the bad disposition; fourthly, its opposite, the good disposition; fifthly, the Maker and Father of the Universe Himself.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="178"><p> The proofs of this statement are

supplied by the Oracles of Scripture: let us see what they are. There is one such declaration in the beginning of the Book of the Law, immediately after the record of the Creation of the World, running as follows: “A spring went up out of the earth and watered all the face of the earth” (Gen. ii.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="179"><p> 6). Those who are

unversed in allegory and the nature-truth which

<pb n="109"/>

loves to conceal its meaning compare the spring mentioned with the River of Egypt, which rises in flood yearly and turns the plain into a lake, seeming to exhibit a power well-nigh rivalling the sky.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="180"><p> For

what the sky is in winter to other countries, this the Nile is to Egypt in the height of summer: the one sends the rain from above upon the earth, the other, strange to say, rains up from below and waters the fields.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="181"><p> This afforded Moses ground
<note n="5.109.a">Literally “starting from which,” i.e. this is the original cause of the facts which led Moses to brand, etc. <hi rend="italic">Cf. De Mos.</hi> ii. 193 ff., where the blasphemy of the son of an Egyptian father (Lev. xxiv. 10–15) is ascribed to the atheism of Egypt and this to their deification of a mere river.</note>
  for branding the Egyptian character as atheistical in its preference for earth above heaven, for the things that live on the ground above those that dwell on high, and the body above the soul.However, it will

be possible to speak of this hereafter, when opportunity permits. At present the need for aiming at brevity compels me to take up the interpretation of the passage allegorically, and to say that “a spring going up and watering all the face of the earth” has the meaning I am about to give.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="182"><p> Our dominant

faculty resembles a spring: and from it like the spring water through the veins of the earth well up many powers which it sends forth till they reach the senses, eyes, ears, nostrils, and so on. Every animal has those in its head and face. Thus the dominant faculty in the soul waters, as from a spring, the face, which is the dominant part of the body, extending to the eyes the spirit
<note n="5.109.b">Or “current.”</note>
  of vision, that of hearing to the ears, to the nostrils that of smelling,



<pb n="111"/>

that of tasting to the mouth, and that of touch to the whole surface.

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="183"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="33"/> There are also a variety of springs of

education, by the side of which there grow up, like stems of palm-trees, upright forms of reason rich in nourishing food. For we read that “they came to Elim, and in Elim there were twelve springs of water, and seventy stems of palm-trees; and they encamped there by the waters” (Exod. xv.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="184"><p> 27). “Elim” means “gateways,” a figure of the entrance to virtue; for just as gateways are the beginnings of a house, so are the preliminary exercises of the schools the beginning of virtue.And

twelve is a perfect number. The zodiac circle in the sky is a witness to this, being adorned with that number of luminous constellations: a further instance is the sun’s circuit, for it completes its round in twelve months, and men keep the hours of day and night equal in number to the months of the year.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="185"><p> And Moses celebrates this number in several places,

telling us of twelve tribes in the nation, directing twelve loaves to be set forth on the Table, bidding them weave twelve inscribed stones on the “oracle” in the holy vestment of the high priest’s full-length robe (Ex. xxviii.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="186"><p> 17 ff.).He also proclaims

the ten-fold seven, telling in this passage of seventy palm-trees by the springs, and in another of the Divine Spirit of prophecy bestowed on only seventy elders (Num. xi. 16), and again of seventy calves offered as victims at the Feast of Tabernacles arranged in divisions following a regular series: for they are not all sacrificed at once, but on different days, beginning with thirteen bull-calves (Num. xxix. 13 ff.); for in this way, the number being

<pb n="113"/>

diminished by one every day up to the seventh, the aggregate of seventy would be made up.
</p></div><div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="187"><p>
When they have arrived at the vestibules of virtue,

the subjects of preliminary instruction, and have beheld springs and palms growing by them, they are said to encamp, not by the trees but by the waters. Why is this? Because palm and fillets are the adornment of those who carry off the prizes of consummate virtue, but those whose sphere is still that of the preliminary studies, athirst as they are for learning, settle down beside the springs of knowledge which are able to water their souls and give them drink.

<milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="34"/> Such are the springs of the lower education.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="188"><p>

Let us now consider the spring of folly, respecting which the Lawgiver has spoken in these terms: “Whosoever shall have slept with a woman in her separation hath unclosed her spring, and she hath unclosed the flow of her blood; let them both be put to death” (Lev. xx. 18): he gives to sense-perception the name woman, suggesting Mind as her husband.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="189"><p> Sense-perception is “in separation,”

which is “sitting a long way off,” when, having forsaken Mind, her lawful husband, she plants herself on the objects of sense that ensnare and corrupt, and passionately embraces them one after another. At such a time, then, if Mind go to sleep, when he ought to be awake, “he has unclosed the spring” of sense-perception, himself to wit—for, as I have already said, he himself is the spring of sense-perception—that is, he has exposed himself, without covering or wall of defence, to the plots of his enemies.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="190"><p> Moreover

she too “unclosed the flow of her blood”; for every sense, in its flow towards the external object of sense, is covered over and drawn in when controlled

<pb n="115"/>

by reason, but is left destitute when widowed of an upright ruler, and as it is the most grievous evil for a city to be without walls, so is it for a soul to be without a protector.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="191"><p> When, then, is it without

a protector? Is it not when sight, spread abroad amid objects of sight, is left uncovered; uncovered too the hearing, flooded by every kind of sound; uncovered the powers of smell and others of like kin, full ready for any experience to which marauding foes may wish to subject them; uncovered again the faculty of speech, giving ill-timed utterance to a thousand things that should have been kept quiet, since there is no one to force back the current?</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="192"><p> In its unhindered flow it has wrecked great life-projects, which were like ships in fair weather sailing on even keel.This is the great deluge in which

“the cataracts of heaven,” that is of the mind, “were opened,” “and the fountains of the abyss,” that is of sense-perception, “were unclosed” (Gen, vii. 11).
<note n="5.115.a">See <hi rend="italic">De Conf.</hi> 23 and note.</note>
  For only in this way is a deluge brought upon the soul, when as though from heaven, that is the mind, wrongdoings burst upon it as in a cataract; and from sense-perception below, as it were from the earth, passions come welling up.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="193"><p> That is why Moses prohibits

the “disclosing of the shame of father and mother” (Lev. xviii. 7), well knowing how great an evil it is not to keep back and conceal the sins of the mind and of sense-perception, but to make them public as though they were achievements of righteousness.

<milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="35"/> Such are the springs of sinful deeds:</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="194"><p> let

us investigate that of sound sense. To this Patience, called Rebecca, goes down, and, when she has filled

the whole vessel of the soul, goes up; for the lawgiver speaks of the descent as an ascent with perfect truth to the nature of things, for a soul that resolves to come down from over-weening imposture is exalted thereby to virtue’s height.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="196"><p> To this spring the sacred message applies most

appropriate names, calling it “judgement”
<note n="5.117.b">Or “sifting.”</note>
  and “holy.” For it says: “They returned and came to the Spring of Judgement; this is Kadesh” (Gen. xiv. 7); and “Kadesh” means “holy.” One might think that it cries aloud that the wisdom of God is both holy, containing no earthy ingredient, and a sifting of all the universe, whereby all opposites are separated from each other.

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="197"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="36"/> And now we have to speak of the supreme

and most excellent Spring, which the All-Father declared by the mouth of prophets. For He said in a certain place: “Me they forsook, a spring of Life, and dug for themselves broken cisterns, which shall fail to hold water” (Jer. ii.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="198"><p> 13). God, therefore, is the

chiefest spring, and well may He be so called, for this whole universe is a rain that fell from Him. But I bow in awe when I hear that this spring is one of Life: for God alone is the Cause of soul and life, and preeminently of the rational soul, and of the Life that is united with wisdom.</p></div>

the impious flee from Him, persist in leaving untasted the water of immortality, and dig in their madness for themselves but not for God, putting their own works above the celestial gifts of heaven, and the results of forethought above those which come spontaneously and ready for their use.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="200"><p> That is their first

folly. In the next place they dig, not as did the wise, Abraham and Isaac, wells (Gen. xxi. 30, xxvi. 18), deep sources of knowledge from which draughts of reason are drawn, but cisterns, having no excellent thing of their own to afford nourishment, but needing the inflow from without, that must come from teaching, as the instructors keep on pumping in unbroken stream into the ears of their pupils the principles and conclusions which constitute knowledge, that they may both grasp what is imparted to them with their intelligence and treasure it in their memory.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="201"><p> As it is

the “cisterns” are “broken,” that is to say, all the receptacles of the ill-conditioned soul are crushed and leaking, unable to hold in and keep the inflow of what might do them good.

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="202"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="37"/> On the subject of springs all that the

occasion required has now been said. But it is with a most carefully considered meaning that Hagar is represented by the sacred oracles as found by the spring but not drawing water from it (Gen. xvi.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="203"><p> 7). For a soul, while making gradual progress, is not yet capable of availing itself of Wisdom’s untempered draught, but such a soul is not prevented from staying hard by her.Now the road of discipline

is all a highway, thoroughly safe and well guarded. Wherefore it says that she was found in the way to Shur
<note n="5.119.a">Or “the way (called) Shur.”</note>
  (<hi rend="italic">ibid.</hi>), and “Shur” means “wall” or “straightening.”

The inward monitor, then, speaking within the soul, says to it, “Whence comest thou, and whither art thou going?” (<hi rend="italic">ibid.</hi> 8). In thus addressing her he does not express doubt or inquiry; rather he is reproaching and putting her to shame; for we may not think that an angel is ignorant of anything affecting us.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="204"><p> Here is a proof of it: even the secrets of the

womb, which are hidden from created beings, the angel knows with certainty, as his words shew: “Lo, thou art with child, and shalt give birth to a boy, and shalt call his name Ishmael” (<hi rend="italic">ibid.</hi> 11). For it is not in the power of man to know that the embryo is a male, nor to know the principle that is to govern the life of one who is not yet born, that it will be the way of the rude country-side, not the refined one of civic life.

So the words “Whence comest thou?”

are spoken to rebuke the soul that is running away from the better judgement, “the mistress,” a mistress whom to serve as handmaiden could not but win her high renown, if the service be one of deeds rather than of name. And the words “Whither goest thou?” mean “Thou hast cast away acknowledged gains, and art running after uncertainties.

”We may well praise her for receiving reproof with

gladness.
<note n="5.121.a">It is difficult to give any sense to οὖν. Perhaps read γοῦν (transitional).</note>
  Of her gladness she has given plain evidence by not accusing her mistress, and by laying the blame of her flight upon herself, and by making no answer to the second question “Whither art thou going?” for it was uncertain, and regarding uncertainties suspension of judgement is not only safe but requisite.

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="208"><p> For so doing thou shalt give birth with

easy travail to a male offspring, Ishmael by name (<hi rend="italic">ibid.</hi> 11), since thou shalt have been chastened by hearkening to words of God; for “Ishmael” means “hearkening to God.” Hearing takes the second place, yielding the first to sight, and sight is the portion of Israel, the son free-born and first-born; for “seeing God” is the translation of “Israel.” It is possible to hear the false and take it for true, because hearing is deceptive, but sight, by which we discern what really is, is devoid of falseness.

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="209"><p><milestone unit="para"/>The character thus given birth to is described first

by the statement that it will be rude, of rude “mother wit” as it were, not yet admitted to the privilege of the refined and truly civilized lot, virtue, that is, the natural refiner and tamer of character;next by the words “his hands shall be against all men, and all men’s hands against him” (<hi rend="italic">ibid.</hi> 12); for this is just the Sophist’s way, with his pretence of excessive open-mindedness, and his love of arguing for arguing’s sake.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="210"><p> This character aims its shafts at

adds a third characteristic in the words “he shall dwell face to face with all his brethren” (<hi rend="italic">ibid.</hi>), words which are almost a distinct picture of combat face to face and perpetual opposition.

<milestone unit="para"/>The soul, then, which is pregnant with the sophist-principle says to the monitor who is talking to her:</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="212"><p> “Thou art God that didst look upon me,” which is equivalent to saying “Thou art the Maker of my wishes and offspring”; and well may she say this,

for of free and really high-born souls He who is free and sets free is the Creator, while slaves are makers of slaves: and angels are God’s household-servants, and are deemed gods by those whose existence is still one of toil and bondage.</p></div>

<note n="5.125.a">The connexion of thought is obscure. Perhaps: the angel has decreed what the offspring of the Hagar or slave-soul will be. He is therefore its maker, and as making is the attribute of God, she naturally gives that name to God’s subordinate minister.</note>

<note n="5.125.b">E.V. Beer-lahai-roi, explained in the margin as “the well of the living one who seeth me.” Whatever the exact meaning of the LXX was, the next sentence shows that Philo interpreted it as in the translation (ἐνώπιον probably taken as an adjective with αὐτόν understood).</note>
  (<hi rend="italic">ibid</hi>. 14). Nay, how couldst

thou fail, thou soul, who in thy progress art dipping deep into the school-lore knowledge, to see reflected in thy training as in a mirror the Author of that knowledge?Most appropriate too is the situation of such a well “between Kadesh and Bered” (<hi rend="italic">ibid</hi>. 14): “Bered” means “in evils,” and Kadesh “holy,” for he that is in gradual progress is on the borderland between the holy and the profane, fleeing from bad things, but not yet competent to share the life of perfect goodness.
