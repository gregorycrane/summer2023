  save the one, and the other against giving honours to the works of men’s hands</head>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="1"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="1"/>
<note n="7.101.b">In the MSS. this chapter is headed Περὶ περιτομῆς.</note>
 The Ten Words, as they are called, the main



heads under which are summarized the Special Laws, have been explained in detail in the preceding treatise. We have now, as the sequence of our dissertation
<note n="7.101.c">Or (as Mangey and Heinemann) “in the order indicated in the scriptures,” i.e. though the laws are not actually grouped in the Pentateuch under the Ten Commandments, such an order is suggested by the Decalogue. γραφή, however, in this sense seems to be regularly coupled with ἱερά. For the meaning given in the translation <hi rend="italic">cf. De Ebr</hi>, 1, <hi rend="italic">De Som.</hi> i. 1.</note>
  requires, to examine the particular ordinances. I will begin with that which is an object of ridicule among many people.</p></div>



<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="2"><p> Now the practice



which is thus ridiculed, namely the circumcision of the genital organs, is very zealously observed by many other nations, particularly by the Egyptians, a race regarded as pre-eminent for its populousness, its antiquity and its attachment to philosophy.</p></div>



<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="3"><p>
<note n="7.101.d">For circumcision in Egypt see App. p. 615.</note>
  And



therefore it would be well for the detractors to desist from childish mockery and to inquire in a wiser and more serious spirit into the causes to which the







<pb n="103"/>





persistence of this custom is due, instead of dismissing the matter prematurely and impugning the good sense of great nations. Such persons might naturally reflect that all these thousands in every generation undergo the operation and suffer severe pains in mutilating the bodies of themselves and their nearest and dearest, and that there are many circumstances which urge the retention and performance of a custom introduced by the men of old. The principal reasons are four in number.</p></div>



<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="4"><p>  One



is that it secures exemption from the severe and almost incurable malady of the prepuce called anthrax or carbuncle, so named, I believe, from the slow fire
<note n="7.103.a">Or “inward and secret fire.” Lit. “burns smouldering.” Heinemann less accurately, I think, “stark brennt.” Mangey “urit cum inflammatione.”</note>
  which it sets up and to which those who retain the foreskin are more susceptible.</p></div>



<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="5"><p> Secondly, it promotes



the cleanliness of the whole body as befits the consecrated order, and therefore the Egyptians carry the practice to a further extreme and have the bodies of their priests shaved. For some substances which need to be cleared away collect and secrete themselves both in the hair and the foreskin.</p></div>



<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="6"><p> Thirdly, it assimilates
<note n="7.103.b">Lit. “the likeness,” not meaning that they are naturally alike, but that they are made so by circumcision, for ὁμοιότητα, like ἀπαλλαγήν and καθαριότητα above, must give the result of the process.</note>
  the circumcised member to the



heart. For as both are framed to serve for generation, thought being generated by the spirit force in the heart,
<note n="7.103.c">See App. p. 615.</note>
  living creatures by the reproductive organ,













<pb n="105"/>





the earliest men
<note n="7.105.a">Lit. “<hi rend="italic">For</hi> the earliest men.” Here as often in Philo γάρ refers to the sentence before the last, and gives the reason why they adopted circumcision. For the attribution of wisdom to the πρῶτοι <hi rend="italic">cf. De Dec.</hi> 23 σοφοὶ γὰρ ἦσαν, though there, as in <hi rend="italic">De Op.</hi> 133, it is concerned with the giving of names to things. In <hi rend="italic">De Plant.</hi> 49 it is as here more general.</note>
  held that the unseen and superior element to which the concepts of the mind owe their existence should have assimilated to it the visible and apparent, the natural parent of the things perceived by sense.</p></div>



<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="7"><p> The fourth and most vital reason is its



adaptation to give fertility of offspring, for we are told that it causes the semen to travel aright without being scattered or dropped into the folds of the foreskin, and therefore the circumcised nations appear to be the most prolific and populous.

</p></div>



<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="8"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="2"/> These are the explanations handed down to us



from the old-time studies of divinely gifted men who made deep research into the writings of Moses. To these I would add that I consider circumcision to be a symbol of two things most necessary to our well-being.</p></div>



<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="9"><p> One is the excision of pleasures which bewitch



the mind. For since among the love-lures of pleasure the palm is held by the mating of man and woman, the legislators thought good to dock the organ which ministers to such intercourse, thus making circumcision the figure of the excision of excessive
<note n="7.105.b">The equation of περιτομή with περιττῆς ἐκτομή is of course an intentional play upon words; or even perhaps an etymology.</note>
  and superfluous pleasure, not only of one pleasure but of all the other pleasures signified by one, and that the most imperious.</p></div>



<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="10"><p>  The other



reason is that a man should know himself and banish from the soul the grievous malady of conceit. For there are some who have prided themselves on their power of fashioning as with a sculptor’s cunning the fairest of creatures, man, and in their braggart pride assumed godship, closing their eyes to the Cause of all that comes into being, though they might find





<pb n="107"/>





in their familiars a corrective for their delusion.</p></div>



<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="11"><p> For



in their midst are many men incapable of begetting and many women barren, whose matings are ineffective and who grow old childless. The evil belief, therefore, needs to be excised from the mind with any others that are not loyal to God.

<milestone unit="para"/>So much for these matters.</p></div>



<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="12"><p> We must now turn



to the particular laws, taking those first with which it is well to begin, namely those the subject of which is the sole sovereignty of God.

</p></div>



<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="13"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="3"/>
<note n="7.107.a">At this point the MSS. insert the heading Οἱ περὶ μοναρχίας νόμοι, i.e., the laws about the sole sovereignty (of God), and the chapters which follow down to the end of § 65 are treated by Mangey and others as a separate treatise. Cohn observes this in his numeration of the chapters but not of the sections; see Gen. Introd. p. xviii.</note>
 Some have supposed that the sun and moon



and the other stars were gods with absolute powers and ascribed to them the causation of all events. But Moses held that the universe was created and is in a sense the greatest of commonwealths, having magistrates and subjects; for magistrates, all the heavenly bodies, fixed or wandering; for subjects, such beings as exist below the moon, in the air or on the earth.</p></div>



<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="14"><p> The said magistrates, however, in his view



have not unconditional powers, but are lieutenants of the one Father of All, and it is by copying the example of His government exercised according to law and justice over all created beings that they acquit themselves aright; but those who do not descry the Charioteer mounted above attribute the causation of all the events in the universe to the team that draw the chariot as though they were sole agents.</p></div>



<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="15"><p> From this ignorance our most holy lawgiver would



convert them to knowledge with these words: “Do not when thou seest the sun and the moon and the stars and all the ordered host of heaven go astray and





<pb n="109"/>





worship them.”
<note n="7.109.a">Deut. iv. 19.</note>
  Well indeed and aptly does he call the acceptance of the heavenly bodies as gods a going astray or wandering.</p></div>



<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="16"><p> For those who see the sun



with its advances and retreats producing the yearly seasons in which the animals and plants and fruits are brought at fixed periods of time from their birth to maturity, and the moon as handmaid and successor to the sun taking over at night the care and supervision of all that he had charge of by day, and the other stars in accordance with their sympathetic affinity to things on earth acting and working in a thousand ways for the preservation of the All, have wandered infinitely far in supposing that they alone are gods.</p></div>



<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="17"><p> But if they had been at pains to walk in



that road where there is no straying, they would at once have perceived that just as sense is the servitor of mind, so too all the beings perceived by sense are the ministers of Him who is perceived by the mind. It is enough for them if they gain the second place.</p></div>



<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="18"><p> For it is quite ridiculous to deny that if the mind in



us, so exceedingly small and invisible, is yet the ruler of the organs of sense, the mind of the universe, so transcendently great and perfect, must be the King of kings who are seen by Him though He is not seen by them.</p></div>



<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="19"><p> So all the gods which sense descries in



Heaven must not be supposed to possess absolute power but to have received the rank of subordinate rulers, naturally liable to correction, though in virtue of their excellence never destined to undergo it.</p></div>



<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="20"><p> Therefore carrying our thoughts beyond all the realm



of visible existence let us proceed to give honour to the Immaterial, the Invisible, the Apprehended by the understanding alone, who is not only God of gods, whether perceived by sense or by mind, but



<pb n="111"/>





also the Maker of all. And if anyone renders the worship due to the Eternal, the Creator, to a created being and one later in time, he must stand recorded as infatuated and guilty of impiety in the highest degree.

</p></div>



<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="21"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="4"/>
<note n="7.111.a">Here Philo begins the consideration of the second commandment, though no special heading is given in the MSS.</note>
 There are some who put gold and silver in the



hands of sculptors as though they were competent to fashion gods; and the sculptors taking the crude material and furthermore using mortal form for their model, to crown the absurdity shape gods, as they are supposed to be. And after erecting and establishing temples they have built altars and in their honour hold sacrifices and processions with other religious rites and ceremonies conducted with the most elaborate care, and the vain shew is treated by priests and priestesses with the utmost possible solemnity.</p></div>



<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="22"><p> Such idolaters are warned by the Ruler of All in these



words: “Ye shall not make with Me gods of silver and gold,” and the lesson conveyed is little less than a direct command,
<note n="7.111.b">Ex. xx. 23. The argument appears to be “if gold and silver idols are forbidden, still more are idols of inferior materials.”</note>
  “Neither shall ye make gods the work of your hands from any other material if you are prevented from using the best,” for silver and gold hold first place among the sculptor’s materials.

</p></div>



<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="23"><p><milestone unit="para"/>But apart from the literal prohibition,



He seems to me to suggest another thought of great value for the promotion of morality,
<note n="7.111.c">i.e. in the sphere of human conduct, as opposed to our relation to God, to which the commandment in the literal sense belongs. <hi rend="italic">Cf</hi>. the antithesis of ἠθική and φυσική (in the sense of theological), <hi rend="italic">Mos.</hi> ii. 96.</note>
  and to condemn strongly the money-lovers who procure gold and silver coins from every side and treasure their hoard like a







<pb n="113"/>





divine image in a sanctuary, believing it to be a source of blessing and happiness of every kind.</p></div>



<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="24"><p> And



further, all the needy who are possessed by that grievous malady, the desire for money, though they have no wealth of their own on which they may bestow worship as its due, pay awe-struck homage to that of their neighbours, and come at early dawn to the houses of those who have abundance of it as though they were the grandest temples, there to make their prayers and beg for blessing from the masters as though they were gods.</p></div>



<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="25"><p> To such he says



elsewhere “Ye shall not follow idols and ye shall not make molten gods,”
<note n="7.113.a">Lev. xix. 4.</note>
  thus teaching them in a figure that it is not fitting to assign divine honours to wealth. For it is the nature of the far-famed materials of wealth, gold and silver, to melt,
<note n="7.113.b">The argument is “since gold and silver, substances which <hi rend="italic">melt</hi>, are the chief materials of the <hi rend="italic">phantom</hi> wealth, idols (i.e. phantoms) and <hi rend="italic">molten</hi> gods may be understood to indicate riches.” If εἶναι is read instead of χεῖσθαι, the point of χωνευτούς is lost.</note>
  and they are followed by the multitude who think that what “blind”
<note n="7.113.c">The addition of λεγομένου indicates that the phrase is proverbial or a quotation. See App. pp. 615–616.</note>
  wealth has to give is the sole or the chief source of happiness.</p></div>



<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="26"><p> It is these that he calls “idols,” like to



shadows and phantoms, with nothing firm or strong to which they can cling. They are borne along like a restless wind, subject to every kind of change and alteration. And of this we have a clear proof. Sometimes they suddenly light on one who has never owned them ere now: then again, when he thinks that they are firmly grasped, they spring away. And indeed when they are present, the apparition is like idols or images seen through mirrors, deceiving and







<pb n="115"/>





bewitching the sense and seeming to subsist when they have no abiding substance.</p></div>



<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="27"><p> And why need we



prove that human riches or human vanity, which empty-headed thinking paints in such bright colours, are unstable? For we know that some
<note n="7.115.a">Particularly Heracleitus and his followers. See App. p. 616.</note>
  assert that all other living creatures and plants which are born and perish are in a constant and ceaseless state of flux, though our perception of the effluence is indistinct, because the swiftness of its course always defeats the efforts of the eyesight to observe it with exactness.

</p></div>



<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="28"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="5"/> But not only wealth and glory and the like



are idols and unsubstantial shadows, but also all those personages, which the myth-makers have invented and spread delusion therewith, building up their false imaginations into a stronghold to menace the truth, and staging as by machinery
<note n="7.115.b">I do not know how to translate this phrase. It is said to denote “a sudden or unexpected event,” but this seems to me inadequate. See App. p. 616.</note>
  new gods, in order that the eternal and really existing God might be consigned to oblivion. And to promote the seductiveness they have fitted the falsehood into melody, metre and rhythm,
<note n="7.115.c">The regular triple division of music. See note on <hi rend="italic">De Som</hi>. i. 205.</note>
  thinking to cajole their audience thereby.</p></div>



<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="29"><p> Further, too, they have brought



in sculpture and painting to co-operate in the deception, in order that with the colours and shapes and artistic qualities wrought by their fine workmanship they may enthrall the spectators and so beguile the two leading senses, sight and hearing—sight through lifeless shapes of beauty, hearing through the charm of poetry and music—and thus make the soul unsteady and unsettled and seize it for their prey.

<pb n="117"/>



</p></div>



<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="30"><p><milestone unit="para"/>Therefore knowing that vanity had attained high



power and was championed by the greater part of the human race, not under compulsion but of their own free will, and fearing lest the devotees of piety, true and incorruptible, might be swept away as by a torrent, he stamped upon their minds as with a seal deep imprints of holiness, so that no fusion or smoothing in the course of years should ever blur their distinctness. This lesson he continually repeats, sometimes saying that God is one and the Framer and Maker of all things, sometimes that He is Lord of created beings, because stability and fixity and lordship are by nature vested in Him alone.</p></div>



<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="31"><p> We are



told, too, that “those who cling to the God that is all live.”
<note n="7.117.a">Deut. iv. 4. The meaning of the original is that all those who took God’s side when the others followed Baal Peor are still alive, Philo has given the same extension of the meaning in <hi rend="italic">De Fuga</hi> 56, and again in § 345 below.</note>
  Is not this the thrice-happy and thrice-blessed life, to cling lovingly to the service of the most ancient Cause of all and to reject the thought of serving the menials and the door-keepers rather than the King? This true life stands inscribed on the tables of nature as deathless and agelong, and the writing that records it must endure with the universe to all eternity.

</p></div>



<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="32"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="6"/> Doubtless hard to unriddle and hard to apprehend



is the Father and Ruler of all, but that is no reason why we should shrink from searching for Him. But in such searching two principal questions arise which demand the consideration of the genuine philosopher. One is whether the Deity exists, a question necessitated by those who practise atheism, the worst form of wickedness, the other is what the Deity is in essence. Now to answer the first question





<pb n="119"/>





does not need much labour, but the second is not only difficult but perhaps impossible to solve. Still, both must be examined.</p></div>



<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="33"><p>
<note n="7.119.a">For illustration of the argument in this and the next section see App. p. 616.</note>
 We see then that any



piece of work always involves the knowledge of a workman. Who can look upon statutes or painting without thinking at once of a sculptor or painter? Who can see clothes or ships or houses without getting the idea of a weaver and a shipwright and a house-builder? And when one enters a well-ordered city in which the arrangements for civil life are very admirably managed, what else will he suppose but that this city is directed by good rulers?</p></div>



<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="34"><p> So then



he who comes to the truly Great City, this world, and beholds hills and plains teeming with animals and plants, the rivers, spring-fed or winter torrents, streaming along, the seas with their expanses, the air with its happily tempered phases, the yearly seasons passing into each other,
<note n="7.119.b">For this use of τροπαί for the transitions of the four seasons rather than for the two solstices cf. τροπὰς τέσσαρας <hi rend="italic">Mos.</hi> ii. 124.</note>
  and then the sun and moon ruling the day and night, and the other heavenly bodies fixed or planetary and the whole firmament revolving in rhythmic order, must he not naturally or rather necessarily gain the conception of the Maker and Father and Ruler also?</p></div>



<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="35"><p> For none of the works



of human art is self-made, and the highest art and knowledge is shewn in this universe, so that surely it has been wrought by one of excellent knowledge and absolute perfection. In this way we have gained the conception of the existence of God.

</p></div>



<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="36"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="7"/> As for the divine essence, though in fact it is





<pb n="121"/>





hard to track and hard to apprehend, it still calls for all the inquiry possible. For nothing is better than to search for the true God, even if the discovery of Him eludes human capacity, since the very wish to learn, if earnestly entertained, produces untold joys and pleasures.</p></div>



<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="37"><p> We have the testimony of those who



have not taken a mere sip of philosophy but have feasted more abundantly on its reasonings and conclusions. For with them the reason soars away from earth into the heights, travels through the upper air and accompanies the revolutions of the sun and moon and the whole heaven and in its desire to see all that is there finds its powers of sight blurred, for so pure and vast is the radiance that pours therefrom that the soul’s eye is dizzied by the flashing of the rays.</p></div>



<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="38"><p> Yet it does not therefore faintheartedly give up the



task, but with purpose unsubdued presses onwards to such contemplation as is possible, like the athlete who strives for the second prize since he has been disappointed of the first. Now second to the true vision stands conjecture and theorizing and all that can be brought into the category of reasonable probability.</p></div>



<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="39"><p> So then just as, though we do not know



and cannot with certainty determine what each of the stars is in the purity of its essence, we eagerly persist in the search because our natural love of learning makes us delight in what seems probable, </p></div>



<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="40"><p>so too,

though the clear vision of God as He really is is denied us, we ought not to relinquish the quest. For the very seeking, even without finding, is felicity in itself, just as no one blames the eyes of the body because when unable to see the sun itself they see the emanation of its rays as it reaches the earth, which is but the extremity of the brightness which the beams of



<pb n="123"/>





the sun give forth.

</p></div>



<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="41"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="8"/> It was this



which Moses the sacred guide, most dearly beloved of God, had before his eyes when he besought God with the words, “Reveal Thyself to me.”
<note n="7.123.a">§§ 41–50 are a meditation on Ex. xxxiii. 13–23. The divine answer to the first petition, “Reveal thyself to me” (<hi rend="italic">v.</hi> 13), is not reproduced by Philo, but the words of § 43, “I freely bestow,” etc., are an interpretation of part of God’s answer to the second petition, “I will be gracious to whom I will be gracious, and will shew mercy on whom I will shew mercy.” In the second petition (<hi rend="italic">v.</hi> 18), which Philo reads, in accordance with some MSS. of the MSS., as “Shew me thy glory” (so also E.V.), glory is interpreted to mean the Powers as distinguished from the Self-existent, and God’s answer, “Thou shalt see the things behind me,” MSS. τὰ ὀπίσω μου (A.V. “my back parts,” R.V. “my back”), is taken to mean “Thou shalt see what lies behind the Powers, i.e. their manifestation in the sensible world.” The same interpretation of the verse is given in <hi rend="italic">De Fuga</hi> 165, <hi rend="italic">De Mut.</hi> 9, <hi rend="italic">De Post.</hi> 169.</note>
  In these words we may almost hear plainly the inspired cry” This universe has been my teacher, to bring me to the knowledge that Thou art and dost subsist. As Thy son, it has told me of its Father, as Thy work of its contriver. But what Thou art in Thy essence I desire to understand, yet find in no part of the All any to guide me to this knowledge.</p></div>



<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="42"><p> Therefore I pray and



beseech Thee to accept the supplication of a suppliant, a lover of God, one whose mind is set to serve Thee alone; for as knowledge of the light does not come by any other source but what itself supplies, so too Thou alone canst tell me of Thyself. Wherefore I crave pardon if, for lack of a teacher, I venture to appeal to Thee in my desire to learn of Thee.”</p></div>



<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="43"><p> He replies, “Thy zeal I approve as praiseworthy, but



the request cannot fitly be granted to any that are brought into being by creation. I freely bestow what is in accordance with the recipient; for not all that I can give with ease is within man’s power to take, and therefore to him that is worthy of My grace I extend all the boons which he is capable of receiving.</p></div>



<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="44"><p> But the apprehension of Me is something more than

  Further, he does not consent to those who wish to



perform the rites in their houses, but bids them rise up from the ends of the earth and come to this temple. In this way he also applies the severest test to their dispositions. For one who is not going to sacrifice in a religious spirit would never bring himself to leave his country and friends and kinsfolk and sojourn in a strange land, but clearly it must be the stronger attraction of piety which leads him to endure separation from his most familiar and dearest friends who form as it were a single whole with himself.</p></div>



<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="69"><p>  And we have the surest proof of this in what actually

For he holds the world to be, as in very truth it is, his country, and in its behalf he is wont to propitiate the Ruler with supplication and intercession, beseeching Him to make His creature a partaker of His own kindly and merciful nature.

  After saying this by way of prelude, he



proceeds to lay down another statute commanding that he who approaches the altar and handles the sacrifices should not during the time in which it is his duty to perform the sacred rites drink wine or any other intoxicant, and this for four most cogent reasons:



<pb n="157"/>





the dangers of slackness, forgetfulness, sleep and foolish behaviour.</p></div>



<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="99"><p> For strong drink enervates the



bodily faculties, and makes the limbs more difficult to move, increases the tendency to sluggishness in a man, and irresistibly forces him to fall asleep, while by relaxing the sinews of the soul it produces both forgetfulness and foolish conduct. When he is sober, his bodily parts are buoyant and easier to move, the senses are clearer and brighter and the mind keener-sighted, so that it can foresee events and recount what it has seen in the past.</p></div>



<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="100"><p> In general, indeed, wine



must be regarded as very unprofitable for every side of life, since it presses hard upon the soul, dulls the senses and weighs down the body, leaving none of our faculties free and untrammelled but hampering the natural activity of each. But in religious rites and ceremonies the mischief is graver in the same degree as it is more intolerable to offend against our duty to God than our duty to man. Thus it is a very proper enactment that the officiants at the sacrifice should fast from wine, “to discern and distinguish between holy and profane, clean and unclean,” lawful and unlawful.
<note n="7.157.a">The words in inverted commas are an almost exact quotation of Lev. x. 10, but the addition “lawful and unlawful,” also represents <hi rend="italic">v.</hi> 11 “to teach the sons of Israel all the statutes” (LXX νόμιμα).</note>

The instruction to inquire into her lineage has no scriptural authority. But Josephus, <hi rend="italic">Contra Apion.</hi> i. 31, entirely supports it as a practice, “He must inquire into her pedigree, obtaining the genealogy from the archives and producing a number of witnesses.” Josephus goes on to say that the practice is observed among the Jews of Egypt, Babylonia, and elsewhere, as much as in Palestine.</note>
  For a harlot is



profane in body and soul, even if she has discarded her trade and assumed a decent and chaste demeanour, and he is forbidden even to approach her, since her old way of living was unholy. Let such a one indeed retain in other respects her civic rights as she has been at pains to purge herself from her defilements, for repentance from wrongdoing is praiseworthy. Nor let anyone else be prevented from taking her in marriage, but let her not come near to the priest. For the rights and duties of the priesthood are of a special kind, and the office demands an even tenor of blamelessness from birth to death.</p></div>



<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="103"><p> It would be



foolish if, while the bodily scars which wounds leave behind them, marks of misfortune and not of depravity, preclude one from the priesthood, the women who have sold their personal charms not only under compulsion but sometimes by free and deliberate choice, should just because of a belated and reluctant repentance pass straight from their lovers to wedlock with the priests and exchange the stews for a lodging in holy ground.

 So strict are the regulations laid down for the

Secondly, that by mating with souls entirely innocent and unperverted they

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="106"><p> But she who has had experience of another husband

<note n="7.163.b">Lev. xxi. 7. The permission is reasonably deduced from the prohibition to marry the divorced.</note>
  though only such as have lost their husbands by death. This limitation is due to the desire of the law to remove animosities and feuds from the lives of the priests. While the first husband lives, quarrels might be engendered by the feminine proclivity to jealousy.
<note n="7.163.c">As the jealousy is clearly that felt by one or both of the husbands, I do not see the point of “feminine” unless it means that such a feeling is natural in a woman, but disgraceful to a man.

This was the reason why he did not forbid the other priests to intermarry with the laity of the nation, for intermarriage is kinship in the second degree.

  For the services of the other priests can be performed by deputy, so that if some are in mourning none of the customary rites need suffer.

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="128"><p> There is a third point for

  He is their inheritance for two reasons. One is the supreme honour conferred by sharing with God in the thank-offering rendered to Him.

 After that he assigns another considerable source of wealth to the priests when he commands everyone to give first-fruits of his revenues from corn and wine and oil, and again of the increase of their livestock levied on their flocks and herds, of sheep and oxen and goats and other animals, and how great an abundance the nation possesses of these may be judged from the magnitude of the population.</p></div>

 It is ordained that with every victim two gifts should be presented to the priest from two of its parts, the arm or shoulder from the right side and all the fat from the breast, the former as a symbol of strength and manliness and of all lawful operations in giving and receiving and general activity, the latter of gentle mildness applied to the spirited element.</p></div>

the priests who minister at the holy sacrifices should receive the hides of the whole-burnt-offerings, the number of which is incalculable, and this is no small gift, but represents a very large sum of money. From these things it is clear that the law did not provide the consecrated tribe with a single portion, like the others, but gave it, under the guise of first-fruits from every kind of sacrifice, a source of revenue of greater dignity and sanctity than that of them all put together.</p></div>

 Of the

<note n="7.191.b">See Lev. i. 14.</note>
  the pigeon because it is the gentlest of those whose nature is tame and gregarious, the dove

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="163"><p> The land animals collect in vast



multitudes and the number of their varieties is almost incalculable. All these he passed over after selecting three as of superior merit, namely, oxen, sheep and goats.
<note n="7.193.a">Oxen, Lev. i. 3 f.; sheep and goats, i. 10 f.</note>
  For these are the gentlest and the most docile. We see great herds and flocks of each kind led by a single person, it matters not who.

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="165"><p> Furthermore,



in the whole animal kingdom they are the most serviceable for human life. The rams produce raiment, the indispensable shelter for the body, the ox ploughs the soil and prepares it for the seed, and when the crop is produced threshes it, thus making it into food which can be shared and enjoyed, while the skin and hair of the goat, when woven or sewn together, supply portable houses for travellers and particularly for campaigners who are compelled by the exigencies of their life to spend most of their time outside the city and in the open air.

 In fact, so great is the forethought exercised not only by those

who bring the sacrifices but also by the officiants, that the most highly approved of the priests, selected as most suitable for such inspection, examine them from the head to the extremities of the feet, both the visible parts and those which are concealed under the belly and thighs, for fear that some small blemish has passed unobserved.</p></div>



<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="167"><p> The examination is carried



out with this excessive minuteness in consideration not of the victims offered but of the innocence of those who offer them. For the law would teach them under this symbol that when they approach the altar to offer either prayers or thanks they must come with no infirmity or ailment or evil affection in the soul, but must endeavour to have it sanctified and free throughout from defilement, that God when He beholds it may not turn away His face from the sight.

performed on behalf of the nation or, to speak more correctly, on behalf of the human race, have now been described to the best of my ability. But these burnt-offerings are accompanied on each day of a feast by the sacrifice of a kid called the sin-offering offered for the remission of sins, its flesh being put aside to be eaten by the priests.</p></div>



<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="191"><p>
<note n="7.209.b">The mention of the sin-offering occurs regularly in Num</note>
  What is the reason for this 



addition? Is it that a feast is a season of joy, and the true joy in which there is no illusion is wisdom firmly established in the soul, and the wisdom that is stable cannot be acquired without applying medicine to the sin and surgery to the passions? For it would be a strange inconsistency if, while each of the victims consumed in the burnt-offering is only dedicated when found to be free from mischief and blemish, the mind of the worshipper should not be purified in every way and washed clean and fair by the ablutions and lustrations, which the right reason of nature pours into the souls of those who love God through ears that are sound in health and free from corruption.</p></div>



<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="192"><p> But besides 



this something else may be justly said. These festal occasions of relaxation and cessation from work have often ere now opened up countless avenues to transgressions. For strong drink and gross eating accompanied by wine-bibbing, while they awaken the insatiable lusts of the belly, inflame also the lusts seated below it, and as they stream along and overflow on every side they create a torrent of evils in-numerable,





<pb n="211"/>





because they have the immunity of the feast for their headquarters and refuge from retribution.</p></div>



<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="193"><p> All this the lawgiver observed and therefore 



did not permit his people to conduct their festivities like other nations, but first he bade them in the very hour of their joy make themselves pure by curbing the appetites for pleasure. Then he summoned them to the sanctuary to take their part in hymns and prayers and sacrifices, that the place and the spectacles there presented and the words there spoken, working through the lordliest of the senses, sight and hearing, may make them enamoured of continence and piety. Last of all by the sin-offering he warned them against continuing in sin, for he who asks for absolution of the sins he has committed is not so lost a wretch as to embark on other new offences at the very time when he asks for remission of the old.

</p></div>



<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="194"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="36"/> After having discoursed to this extent 



on these subjects he begins to classify the kinds of sacrifices. He divides them into three principal classes which he calls respectively the whole-burnt-offering, the preservation-offering and the sin-offering. To each of these he adds the adornment of suitable ritual, in which he succeeds admirably in combining decorum with reverence.</p></div>



<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="195"><p> His classification is quite 



excellent and perfectly fits the facts to which it shews a logical sequence. For if anyone cares to examine closely the motives which led men of the earliest times to resort to sacrifices as a medium of prayer and thanksgiving, he will find that two hold the highest place. One is the rendering of honour to God for the sake of Him only and with no other motive, a thing both necessary and excellent. The other is the signal benefit which the worshipper



<pb n="213"/>





receives, and this is twofold, on one side directed to obtaining a share in blessings, on the other to release from evils.</p></div>



<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="196"><p> To the God-ward motive which has Him 



alone in view he assigned the whole-burnt-offering, for, whole and complete in itself as it is, it fits in well with the same qualities in the motive which carries with it no element of mortal self-interest; but where human interests were concerned, since the idea admitted of division, the lawgiver also made a division, and appointed what he called a preservation-offering to correspond to the aspiration for participation in blessings, while he assigned the sin-offering for avoidance of evils.</p></div>



<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="197"><p> Thus very properly 



there are three offerings for three objects, the whole-burnt-offering having no other in view but God Himself alone Whom it is good to honour, the other two having ourselves in view, the preservation-offering for the safe preserving and bettering of human affairs, the sin-offering for the healing of the trespasses which the soul has committed.

</p></div>



<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="198"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="37"/> We must now describe the ordinances 



dealing with each of these sacrifices, beginning with the best, which is the whole-burnt-offering.
<note n="7.213.a">See Lev. i. 3 ff.</note>
 First of all, he says the victim must be a male specimen of the animals selected as best for the purpose, namely, a calf or lamb or kid.</p></div>



<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="199"><p> Secondly, the giver must wash his hands and lay them on the head of the victim, and after this one priest must take and slay it while 



another priest holds a vial below and after catching some of the blood goes all round the altar and sprinkles it thereon. The victim after being flayed must be divided into parts complete in themselves, while the belly and feet are washed, and then the whole must be given over to the sacred fire of the altar. Thus



<pb n="215"/>





the one in it has become many and the many one.</p></div>



<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="200"><p>
<note n="7.215.a"><hi rend="italic">Cf.</hi> § 208.</note>
  These are the contents of the ordinance taken 



literally. But another meaning also is indicated of the mystical character which symbols convey; words in their plain sense are symbols of things latent and obscure.  In the first place the victim of the whole-burnt-offering is a male because the male is more complete, more dominant than the female, closer akin to causal activity, for the female is incomplete and in subjection and belongs to the category of the passive rather than the active.</p></div>



<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="201"><p> So 



too with the two ingredients which constitute our life-principle, the rational and the irrational; the rational which belongs to mind and reason is of the masculine gender, the irrational, the province of sense, is of the feminine. Mind belongs to a genus wholly superior to sense as man is to woman; unblemished and purged, as perfect virtue purges, it is itself the most religious of sacrifices and its whole being is highly pleasing to God.</p></div>



<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="202"><p>  In the 



laying of hands on the head of the animal we find the clearest possible type of blameless actions and of a life saddled with nothing that leads to censure but in harmony with the laws and statutes of nature.</p></div>



<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="203"><p> For 



the law desires, first, that the mind of the worshipper should be sanctified by exercise in good and profitable thoughts and judgements; secondly, that his life should be a consistent course of the best actions, so that as he lays his hands on the victim, he can boldly and with a pure conscience speak in this wise: </p></div>



<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="204"><p>“These hands have taken no gift to do injustice, nor 



shared in the proceeds of plunder or overreaching, nor been soiled with innocent blood. None have





<pb n="217"/>





they maimed or wounded, no deed of outrage or violence have they wrought. They have done no service of any other kind at all which might incur arraignment or censure, but have made themselves humble ministers of things excellent and profitable, such as are held in honour in the sight of wisdom and law and wise and law-abiding men.”

</p></div>



<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="205"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="38"/> The blood is poured in a circle round the 



altar because the circle is the most perfect of figures, and in order that no part should be left destitute of the vital oblation. For the blood may truly be called a libation of the life-principle. So, then, he teaches in this symbol that the mind, whole and complete, should, as it moves with measured tread passing circle-wise through every phase of word and intention and deed, shew its willingness to do God’s service.</p></div>

   The direction to wash the belly and the 



feet is highly symbolical. Under the figure of the belly he signifies the lust which it is well to clean away, saturated as it is with stains and pollutions, with wine-bibbing and sottishness, a mighty force for ill, trained and drilled to work havoc in the life of men.</p></div>



<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="207"><p> By the washing of the feet is meant that his

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="208"><p>  The division of the animal

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="209"><p> My own reflections 



lead me to think the following a more correct explanation. The soul which honours the Existent having the Existent Himself only in view, ought to honour Him not irrationally nor ignorantly, but with knowledge and reason. And when we reason about Him we recognize in Him partition and division into each of the Divine powers and excellences. For God is good, He is the maker and begetter of the universe and His providence is over what He has begotten; He is a saviour and a benefactor, and has the plenitude of all blessedness and all happiness. Each of these attributes calls for veneration and praise, both separately in itself and when ranked with its congeners.  So, too, it is with the rest.</p></div>

When, my mind, thou wishest to give thanks to God for the creation of the universe, give it both for the sum of things and for its principal parts, thinking of them as the limbs of a living creature of the utmost

Such parts are heaven and sun and moon and the planets and fixed stars; then again earth and the living creatures or plants thereon, then the sea and rivers, whether spring-fed or winter courses, and all they contain: then the air and its phases, for winter and summer, spring and autumn, those seasons which recur annually and are so highly beneficial to our life, are different conditions in the air which changes for the preservation of sublunar things.</p></div>



<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="211"><p> And if thou givest 



thanks for man, do not do so only for the whole genus but for its species and most essential parts, for men and women, for Greeks and barbarians, for dwellers on the mainland and those whose lot is cast in the islands. And if it is for a single person, divide the thanksgiving as reason directs, not into every tiny part of him down to the very last, but into those of primary importance, first of all into body and soul of which he is composed, then into speech and mind and sense. For thanks for each of these will by itself be not unworthy to obtain audience with God.

</p></div>



<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="212"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="39"/> Enough has now been said on the whole 



burnt-offering. We must now consider in its turn the preservation-offering.
<note n="7.221.a">E.V. “peace-offering.” See Lev. iii. 1 ff.</note>
  In this case it is a matter of indifference whether the victim is male or female. When it has been slain these three, the fat, the lobe
<note n="7.221.b">E.V. “the caul upon the liver.”</note>
  of the liver and the two kidneys, are set apart for the altar, while the rest serves as a feast to be enjoyed by the person who has offered the sacrifice.</p></div>



<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="213"><p> But why 



these parts of the inwards are consecrated must be carefully considered, not neglecting the following point. In the course of my reflections I have often pondered deeply on this question also; what could



<pb n="223"/>





be the reason why the law, when setting apart the lobe of the liver and the kidneys and the fat as a tribute reserved from the animals sacrificed, did not include either the heart or the brains, since the dominant principle resides in one or other of them.</p></div>



<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="214"><p>
<note n="7.223.a">See the very similar passage in <hi rend="italic">De Sac.</hi> 136, and the note there on the question whether τὸ ἡγεμονικόν resided in the brain or in the heart.</note>
  And I 



expect the same question will present itself to not a few of those who read the holy scriptures with their understanding rather than with their eyes. If such persons after examination find a more convincing reason, they will benefit both themselves and me; if not I beg them to consider whether that which has commended itself to my mind will stand the test. It is as follows. The dominant principle is the only part of us which admits and retains folly and injustice and cowardice and the other vices, and the home of this principle is one or other of the two just mentioned, namely, the brain and the heart.</p></div>



<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="215"><p> The holy word, 



therefore, thought good that the altar of God, by which is given absolution and complete remission of all sins and transgressions, should not be approached by the container in which mind had its lair when it came forth to tread the pathless wilds of injustice and impiety, turning away from the road which leads to virtue and noble conduct. For it would be foolish to have the sacrifices working remembrance instead of oblivion of sin. This seems to me the reason why neither of the parts which hold the pre-eminence, the brain or the heart, is brought to the altar.

</p></div>



<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="216"><p><milestone unit="para"/>As for the parts which are actually prescribed, 



appropriate reasons can be given for the choice. The fat is the richest part and acts as a protection to the inwards, serving as a covering and a source of richness to them and benefiting them by the softness of its contact. The kidneys are chosen because of their



<pb n="225"/>





relation to the testicles and generative organs; situated beside them they give them neighbourly assistance, and co-operate in promoting the easy passage of nature’s seed unimpeded by any of the adjacent parts. For the kidneys themselves are blood-coloured receptacles in which the moist off-scouring of the excrement is secreted, and contiguous to them are the testicles which create the stream of the semen. The lobe is a sample tribute from the most important of the inwards, the liver, by which the food is converted into blood and then being sluiced into the heart, is conveyed through the veins for the conservation of the whole body.</p></div>



<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="217"><p> For the 



orifice of the stomach being adjacent to the gullet receives the food which has been first bitten off by the teeth and afterwards masticated, and by its action prepares it for the stomach itself. This receives it from the orifice and performs the second office to which it has been appointed by nature, by turning it into juice. And from the stomach there are two pipe-shaped channels extending to the liver and draining the food into the receptacles which lie at intervals therein.</p></div>



<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="218"><p> Now the liver has two properties: 



it acts both as a sifter and a creator of blood. As a sifter it secretes all the hard and callous stuff into the adjacent bile-vessel, while in its other capacity by means of the heat which it contains it turns the pure liquid which has been strained off into blood full of life-giving powers, then presses this blood into the heart, whence, as we have said, it is sluiced into the veins, and coursing through the whole body becomes

<note n="7.227.b">I do not understand what Philo means by μετέωρος (“high up”). Plato’s description of the liver is that God set it in the dwelling-place of the lusting (ἐπιθυμητικόν) part of the soul and made it “dense and smooth and bright, with a share of</note>

In consequence when the mind withdrawing from its daytime cares, with the body paralyzed in sleep and the obstruction of every sense removed, begins to turn itself about and concentrate upon the pure observation of its concepts, it looks into the liver as into a mirror where it gains a lucid view of all that mind can perceive and, while its gaze travels round the images to see whether they contain any ugly defect, it eschews all such and selects their opposites, and so, well satisfied

 Two days only are allowed for the use of the 



preservation-offering as food, and nothing is to be left over till the third day. This for several reasons. One is, that all the meats of the sacred table must be eaten without undue delay, care being taken that they should not deteriorate through lapse of time. It is the nature of stale flesh to decay rapidly, even though seasoned with spices as preservatives.</p></div>



<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="221"><p> Another 





<pb n="229"/>





reason is, that the sacrificial meals should not be hoarded, but be free and open to all who have need, for they are now the property not of him by whom but of Him to Whom the victim has been sacrificed, He the benefactor, the bountiful, Who has made the convivial company of those who carry out the sacrifices partners of the altar whose board they share. And He bids them not think of themselves as the entertainers, for they are the stewards of the good cheer, not the hosts. The Host is He to Whom the material provided for the feast has come to belong, and this must not be stowed away out of sight, and niggardliness, the vice of the slave, preferred to kindliness, the virtue of gentle birth.</p></div>



<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="222"><p> The final reason is, that the 



preservation-offering is in fact made in behalf of two, namely soul and body, to each of which he assigned one day for feasting on the flesh. For it was meet that an equal space of time should be appointed for those elements of our nature which are capable of being preserved, so that on the first day as we eat we obtain a reminder of the soul’s preservation, on the morrow of the body’s good health.</p></div>



<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="223"><p> And since there 



is no third thing which, properly speaking, could be the subject of preservation, he strictly forbade the use of the oblation as food on the third day, and commanded that if anything was left over through ignorance or inadvertence, it should immediately be consumed by fire.
<note n="7.229.a">See Lev. xix. 7, 8. Philo’s close following of the text should be noticed, LXX ἐὰν δὲ βρώσει βρωθῇ . . . ἄθυτόν (E.V. “abomination”) ἐστιν, οὐ δεχθήσεται. His γευσάμενον αὐτὸ μόνον interprets βρώσει βρωθῇ (“be eaten at all”), though elsewhere he does not seem to understand the Hebrew idiom thus rendered in Greek.</note>
 Even him who had tasted it and nothing more he declares to be guilty. “Poor fool,” he says to him, “thou thinkest to have sacrificed, though thou hast not done so. Sacrilegious, unholy, profane, impure, is the meat which thou hast dressed.

<note n="7.231.a">See Lev. vii. 2 f. (E.V. 12 f.). It is embraced in the preservation-offering because it is called θυσία αἰνέσεως σωτηρίου (E.V. “the sacrifice of his peace-offerings for thanksgiving”).</note>
  The principle of this is as follows. He who has never at all met with any untoward happening, either of soul or body or things external, who lives a life of peace undisturbed by war, placed in an environment of every comfort and good fortune, free from disaster and cause of stumbling, sailing in straight course over the long sea of life amid the sunshine and calm of happy circumstances, with the breeze of prosperity ever behind the helm, has as his bounden duty to requite God his pilot, Who gives him safety untouched by disease, benefits carrying no penalty and in general good unmixed with evil—requite Him, I say, with hymns and benedictions and prayers and sacrifices and the other expressions of gratitude as religion demands. All these collected and summed up have obtained the single name of praise.</p></div>

<note n="7.231.c">See Lev. iv. for the high priest (E.V. “anointed priest”), <hi rend="italic">v.</hi> 3; for the nation, <hi rend="italic">v.</hi> 13; for the ruler, <hi rend="italic">v.</hi> 22; for the commoner, <hi rend="italic">v.</hi> 27.</note>
 Here we have several divisions, both according to the persons concerned and the kinds of victims. As to persons, the high priest is distinguished







<pb n="233"/>





from the whole nation and the rulers
<note n="7.233.a">Philo finds the term ἄρχων in the LXX, and does not attempt to explain it. For ἐν μέρει see on κατὰ μέρος, § 208. Possibly it may mean here, “ruler over some particular part,” i.e. of the whole nation.</note>
  as a class from the men of the common people. As to victims, they may be a male calf, a he-goat, a she-goat or ewe-lamb.</p></div>



<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="227"><p> Another distinction made is one 



which is most essential between voluntary and involuntary sins. For those who have acknowledged their sin are changing their way for the better, and while they reproach themselves for their errors are seeking a blameless life as their new goal.</p></div>



<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="228"><p> The sins, 



then, of the high priest and those of the whole nation are purged with an animal of the same value; in both cases it is directed that a male calf should be brought. For the sins of the ruler one of less value is ordered, though this too is a male, namely a he-goat; for the sins of the commoner, one still more inferior in kind, a female offering instead of a male, that is, a she-goat.</p></div>



<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="229"><p> For it was proper that in matters of sacrifice the ruler 



should fare better than the commoner and the nation than the ruler, since the whole should always be superior to the part; also that the high priest should be adjudged the same precedence as the nation in their purification and supplication for forgiveness of wrongdoings from the merciful power of God. But the equality of honour which the high priest enjoys is evidently not so much on his own account as because he is the servant of the nation also, giving thanks in common for all through the holiest of prayers and the purest of sacrifices.</p></div>



<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="230"><p> Deeply and wonderfully 



impressive is the form of command in this matter.
<note n="7.233.b">See Lev. iv. 3. A.V. “according to the sin of the people.” R.V. “so as to bring guilt on the people.” The LXX has not got ἄκων in this verse, but Philo infers it from ἀκουσίως (R.V. “unwittingly”) in <hi rend="italic">v.</hi> 2.</note>
  “If the high priest,” it says, “sins involuntarily,” and then adds, “so that the people sin,” words which





<pb n="235"/>





almost amount to a plain statement from which we may learn that the true high priest who is not falsely so-called is immune from sin, and if ever he slips, it will be something imposed on him not because of what he does himself, but because of some lapse common to the nation. And that lapse is not incurable but admits easily of healing treatment.</p></div>



<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="231"><p>
<note n="7.235.a">See Lev. iv. 6–12.</note>
 So 



when the calf has been slaughtered he bids the priest to sprinkle some of the blood with his finger seven times over against the veil at the inner shrine, beyond the first veil, at the place where the most sacred chattels have been set, and then anoint and smear the four horns of the altar of incense, corresponding to its four sides, and pour the rest of the blood at the foot of the altar in the open air.</p></div>



<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="232"><p> To this altar he 



is commanded to bring three things, the fat and the lobe of the liver and the two kidneys, as in the ordinance of the preservation-offering. But the skin and the flesh and all the rest of the body of the calf from head to foot, with the inwards, are to be carried outside and burnt in a clear and open space
<note n="7.235.b">Or as E.V. “a clean place.” See on § 268.</note>
  whither the holy ashes from the altar also are conveyed. The same rules are laid down by law in the case where the sin lies with the whole nation.</p></div>



<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="233"><p> But if a trespass is 



committed by a ruler, he purges himself with a he-goat, as I have said; if by one of the common people, with a she-goat or a ewe-lamb. For he assigned the male animal to the ruler, the female to the commoner, while the other regulations which he made are similar for both persons, namely, that the horns of the open-air altar should be anointed with the blood, the fat and the lobe of the liver and the two kidneys offered at the altar and the rest given to the priests to eat.

<note n="7.237.a">See Lev. v. 15, 16.</note>
 But since sins are sometimes committed 



against men, sometimes against things sacred and holy, besides the regulations already stated for dealing with involuntary offences against men, he lays down that in the case of the holy things the purificatory propitiation should be made with a ram, the offenders having first made full compensation for the subject of the trespass with the addition of a fifth part of its proper value.

</p></div>



<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="235"><p><milestone unit="para"/>These and similar regulations for involuntary 



offences are followed by his ordinances for such as are voluntary.</p></div>



<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="236"><p>
<note n="7.237.b">See Lev. vi. 2–7. Where, however, it is not suggested that the offender has made a voluntary confession, Philo as also Josephus, <hi rend="italic">Ant.</hi> iii. 232, and indeed modern commentators, infers it from the probability that the convicted criminal would not get off so lightly.</note>
  “If,” he says, “a man lies about a partnership or a deposit or a robbery or as to finding the lost property of someone else, and, being suspected and put upon his oath, swears to the falsehood—if then after having apparently escaped conviction by his accusers he becomes, convicted inwardly by his conscience, his own accuser, reproaches himself for his disavowals and perjuries, makes a plain confession of the wrong he has committed and asks for pardon—then the lawgiver orders that forgiveness be 



extended to such a person on condition that he verifies his repentance not by a mere promise but by his actions, by restoring the deposit or the property which he has seized or found or in any way usurped from his neighbour, and further has paid an additional fifth as a solatium for the offence.</p></div>



<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="237"><p> And when he has thus 



propitiated the injured person he must follow it up, says the lawgiver, by proceeding to the temple to ask for remission of his sins, taking with him as his





<pb n="239"/>





irreproachable advocate the soul-felt conviction which has saved him from a fatal disaster, allayed a deadly disease, and brought him round to complete health. For him, too, the sacrifice prescribed is a ram, as also for the offender in sacred matters.</p></div>



<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="238"><p> For the lawgiver rated the involuntary sin in the sacred sphere as equal 



to voluntary sin in the human, though indeed this last also is perhaps a desecration, since it is supplemented by an oath sworn under dishonest conditions, though rectified by the man’s conversion to the better course.

</p></div>



<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="239"><p><milestone unit="para"/>It must be noticed, however, that while the parts of the sin-offering laid upon the altar are the same 



as in the case of the preservation-offering, namely the lobe of the liver, the fat and the kidneys—a natural arrangement because the penitent also is preserved or saved by escape from the soul-sickness which is more grievous than any which affects the body—</p></div>



<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="240"><p>the conditions under which the other parts of the animal 



are appointed to serve for food are different. The difference is threefold, in the place, in the time and in the recipients.
<note n="7.239.a">See Lev. vi. 25, 26, 29. But there is no order there that it should be eaten in one day. (So also Jos. <hi rend="italic">Ant.</hi> iii. 232 αὐθημερόν.)</note>
  The place is the temple, the time one day instead of two, and the participants are priests, not those who offer the sacrifices: also they are male priests.</p></div>



<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="241"><p>
<note n="7.239.b">This seems to me to indicate that Philo rightly or wrongly takes “every male among the priests,” to mean that apart from this prohibition the women of the priestly clan would be entitled to eat it. In § 110 he has called them “priestesses.”</note>
  The prohibition against carrying the flesh 



outside the temple is due to his wish that any sin which the penitent has previously committed should not be made notorious through the ill-judged judgements and unbridled tongues of malicious and acrimonious persons, and blazed abroad as a subject for





<pb n="241"/>





contumelious and censorious talk, but be confined within the sacred precincts which have also been the scene of the purification.

</p></div>



<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="242"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="44"/> The command that 



the sacrifice should serve as a feast for the priests is due to several reasons. First, to do honour to the givers of the sacrifice, for the dignity of the guests reflects glory on their entertainers; secondly, to secure them firmly in the belief that the graciousness of God extends to those who feel remorse for their sin. For He would never have called His servitors and ministers to share the hospitality of such a table if full pardon had not been given. Thirdly, because none of the priests is permitted to perform the rites if he is not wholly sound, for the slightest blemish causes him to be thrust from office.</p></div>



<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="243"><p>
<note n="7.241.a">The point presumably is that the exclusion of the priests who suffer from defects and therefore cannot have taken part in the sacrifice enhances the honour of the providers of the feast. But see App. p. 621.</note>
  In fact he encourages those 



who no longer tread the path of wrongdoing with the thought that their resolution to purify themselves has given them a place in the sacerdotal caste and advanced them to equal honour with the priest. For a similar reason the flesh of the sin-offering is consumed in a single day, showing that in sin we should procrastinate and be slow and dilatory in approaching it, but when the achievement of righteousness is our goal, act with speed and promptitude.</p></div>



<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="244"><p>  The victims immolated in behalf of the high priest 



or the nation as atonement for trespassing are not dressed to serve as food but are consumed by fire on the sacred ashes, as I have said.
<note n="7.241.b">i.e. in § 232.</note>
 For there is no one superior to the high priest or the nation to act as intercessor for the sinners.</p></div>



<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="245"><p> It is natural therefore 



that the flesh should be consumed by fire in imitation







<pb n="243"/>





of the whole-burnt-offerings to do honour to the persons concerned, not because God’s holy judgements are given by considerations of position but because the sins of the greatly virtuous and the truly sacred are such as to be regarded as acts of righteousness if done by others.</p></div>



<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="246"><p> For as the fields where the 



soil is deep and rich, even if they are sometimes unproductive, bear more fruit than those where it is naturally thin and poor, so too we find in virtuous and God-loving persons that their unproductiveness of positive goodness is better than the fortuitous righteous actions
<note n="7.243.a">Such actions would hardly be κατορθώματα in the strict Stoic sense. See note on <hi rend="italic">Quod Deus</hi> 100.</note>
  of the bad whose nature does not allow them ever to act intentionally in an honest way.

</p></div>



<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="247"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="45"/> After laying down these ordinances about 



each particular kind of sacrifice, whole-burnt-offering, preservation-offering and sin-offering, he institutes rules for another which partakes of the three, to shew the friendship and kinship which exists between them. This connecting link between them is called the Great Vow.
<note n="7.243.b">See Num. vi. 1–12. The “Great Vow” is the name regularly applied to the vow of the Nazirite from <hi rend="italic">v.</hi> 2, ὃς ἂν μεγάλως εὔξηται εὐχὴν ἀφαγνίσασθαι ἁγνείαν (E.V. “made a special vow, the vow of a Nazirite, to separate himself”). The allegorical meaning, as Philo understood it, has been given on special details in several places, and more fully in <hi rend="italic">Quod Deus</hi> 87 ff.</note>
  I must explain why it has acquired this name.</p></div>



<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="248"><p> 



When people have paid first-fruits of every part of their property, in wheat, barley, oil, wine and their finest orchard-fruits and also in the first-born males of their livestock, consecrated in the case of the clean species and valued at an adequate compensation in the case of the unclean, as they have no more material resources with which to give a pledge of their piety, they dedicate and consecrate themselves, thus shewing an amazing sanctification and a surpassing devotion to God. And therefore it is fitly called the Great Vow,





<pb n="245"/>





for his own self is the greatest possession which anyone has, and this self he forgoes and puts himself outside it.</p></div>



<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="249"><p> When he has made the vow, the lawgiver 



gives him the following instructions. First, he must not take any strong drink nor anything “which he makes from the grape” nor drink any other intoxicant to the overthrow of his reason, but hold himself to be serving as priest during that time. For indeed such priests as are performing the rites have to quench their thirst with water and are forbidden intoxicants.</p></div>



<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="250"><p> Secondly, he must not shave the hairs of his head, thus 



giving a clear symbol to the eye that he does not debase the sterling coinage of his vow. Thirdly, he must keep his body pure and undefiled to the extent of abstaining from contact with parents or brothers after death, thus letting his kindly affection and fellow-feeling with the closest and dearest yield to piety that victory which it is both honourable and profitable that it should always win.
<note n="7.245.a">See Num. vi. 13 f.</note>
 

</p></div>



<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="251"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="46"/> When the final day as appointed has come, 



the law bids him bring, to release him from his vow, three animals, a he-lamb, a ewe-lamb and a ram, the first for a whole-burnt-offering, the ewe-lamb as a sin-offering, and the ram as a preservation-offering.</p></div>



<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="252"><p> For all these find their likeness in the maker of the vow: 



the whole-burnt-offering, because he surrenders not only the other first-fruits and gifts but also his own self; the sin-offering, because he is a man, since even the perfect man, in so far as he is a created being, never escapes from sinning; the preservation-offering, because he has acknowledged and adopted the real preserver, God, as the author of his preservation





<pb n="247"/>





instead of the physicians and their faculties of healing. For the physicians are mortals ready to perish, unable to secure health even for themselves, and their faculties are not beneficial to all persons nor always to the same persons, but sometimes do great harm: there is Another who is invested with lordship over such faculties and those who exercise them.</p></div>



<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="253"><p>  I note, and it is a very striking point, that in the three 



animals brought for the different sacrifices there is no difference of species. They are all of the same species, a ram, a he-lamb and a ewe-lamb. For the law wishes to show in this way what I mentioned a little before, that the three kinds of sacrifice are sisters of one family, because the penitent is preserved and the person preserved from the maladies of his soul repents, and both of them are pressing forward to that perfect and wholly sound frame of mind of which the whole-burnt-offering is a symbol.</p></div>



<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="254"><p>  Another point—the votary has vowed to bring himself, 



and while it would be sacrilege that the altar should be defiled by human blood, it was quite necessary that some part of him should be sacrificially offered. The part, therefore, which his zeal prompted him to take was one which can be removed without causing either pain or mutilation. He cut off the hairs of his head, which are to the body like the superfluous branches in the vegetation of a tree,
<note n="7.247.a">Lit. “the part of the body which has ‘growth’ like a tree,” φύσις in this special sense being opposed on the one hand to ἕξις (“cohesion”) as in stones, and on the other to ψυχή (“life”).

  and gave them to the fire in which the flesh of the preservation-offering is cooked, a fitting proceeding to secure that at least some part of the votary’s self which cannot be





<pb n="249"/>





lawfully brought to the altar should be merged in and share the nature of sacrifice
<note n="7.249.a">The Greek phrase is vague. Heinemann “mit einem Stück des Opfers sich vermischte”; Mangey only “sacrificia admiscentur.” I understand it to mean that it comes to belong to the same εἶδος or species as an ordinary sacrifice.</note>

</p></div>



<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="255"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="47"/> These rules apply to the laity in common, 



but the priests also had to make offerings of first-fruits to the altar, and not suppose that the services and ministrations to which they were appointed entitled them to immunity.
<note n="7.249.b">See Lev. vi. 20–22. For “perpetual” see on § 170.</note>
  The first-fruits suitable for the priest are not taken from any animal with blood in its veins, but from the purest form of human food.</p></div>



<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="256"><p> Fine flour constitutes their perpetual 



sacrifice, a tenth part of the sacred measure for every day, half offered in the morning and half in the evening. It is fried in oil and none of it is left over to be eaten.

<note n="7.249.c">Heading in MSS. “Of those who sacrifice,” and fresh numeration of chapters in Cohn.</note>
  The law would have such a person pure 



in body and soul, the soul purged of its passions and distempers and infirmities and every viciousness of word and deed, the body of the defilements which commonly beset it.</p></div>



<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="258"><p> For each it devised the purification 



which befitted it. For the soul it used the animals which the worshipper is providing

  for sacrifice, for the body sprinklings and ablutions of which we will speak a little later. For precedence in speech as well as elsewhere must be given to the higher and









<pb n="251"/>





more dominant element in ourselves, the soul.</p></div>



<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="259"><p> How 



then is the soul purified? “Note, friend,” says the lawgiver, “how perfect and utterly free from blemish is the victim which you bring selected as the best of many by the priests with all impartiality of mind and clearness of vision, the result of the continued practice which has trained them to faultless discrimination. For if you observe this with your reason rather than with your eyes you will proceed to wash away the sins and defilements with which you have besmeared your whole life, some involuntary and accidental, some due to your own free will.</p></div>



<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="260"><p> For 



you will find that all this careful scrutiny of the animal is a symbol representing in a figure the reformation of your own conduct, for the law does not prescribe for unreasoning creatures, but for those who have mind and reason. It is anxious not that the victims should be without flaw but that those who offer them should not suffer from any corroding passion.</p></div>



<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="261"><p>
<note n="7.251.a">See Num. xix. 11 f.</note>
  As for the body, it purifies it 



with ablutions and sprinklings and does not allow the person to be sprinkled and washed once for all and then pass straightway within the sacred precincts, but bids him stay outside for seven days and be twice sprinkled on the third and seventh day, and after that, when he has bathed himself, it gives him full security to come within and offer his sacrifice.

</p></div>



<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="262"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="49"/> The following regulation also shews a far-sighted 



wisdom which should be noted. In almost all other cases men used unmixed water for the sprinkling. By most people it is taken from the sea, by others from the rivers, and by others it is drawn in ewers from the wells.
<note n="7.251.b">See Num. xix. 17, 18.</note>
  But Moses first provided ashes, the remnants of the sacred fire, obtained in a



<pb n="253"/>





manner which will be explained shortly. Some of these, he says, are to be taken and thrown into a vessel and afterwards have water poured upon them. Then the priests are to dip branches of hyssop in the mixture and sprinkle with it those who are being purged.</p></div>



<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="263"><p> The reason for this may be aptly stated as 



follows. Moses would have those who come to serve Him that is first know themselves and of what substance these selves are made. For how should he who has no knowledge of himself be able to apprehend the power of God which is above all and transcends all?</p></div>



<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="264"><p> Now the substance of which our body 



consists is earth and water, and of this he reminds us in the rite of purging. For he holds that the most profitable form of purification is just this, that a man should know himself and the nature of the elements of which he is composed, ashes and water, so little worthy of esteem.</p></div>



<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="265"><p> For if he recognizes this, he will 



straightway turn away from the insidious enemy, self-conceit, and abasing his pride become well-pleasing to God and claim the aid of His gracious power Who hates arrogance. For that is a good text
<note n="7.253.a">See Num. xv. 30 καὶ ψυχὴ ἥτις ποιήσῃ ἐν χειρὶ ὑπερηφανίας . . . τὸν θεὸν οὗτος παροξυνεῖ (LXX).</note>
  which tells us that he who sets his hand to words and deeds of pride “provokes” not only men, but also “God,” the author of equality and all that is most excellent.</p></div>



<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="266"><p> So 



then, whilst they are being thus sprinkled, deeply moved and roused as they are, they can almost hear the voice of the elements themselves, earth and water, say plainly to them, “We are the substance of which your body consists: we it is whom nature blended and with divine craftsmanship made into the shape of human form. Out of us you were framed when you came into being and into us you will be resolved again when you have to die. For nothing is so made

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="267"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="50"/> I must now also fulfil my promise to describe 



the special qualities of these ashes. They are not merely the ashes of wood consumed by fire but also of a living creature well-suited to a rite of purification such as this.</p></div>



<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="268"><p>
<note n="7.255.a">See Num. xix. 2–9.</note>
  He orders a red heifer which has never 



been yoked and without blemish to be taken outside the city and there slaughtered. Then the high priest is to take of the blood and sprinkle it seven times over everything in front of the sanctuary, then burn it wholly to ashes with the skin and flesh and blood and the belly filled with its ordure. When the flame is dying down, he is to cast right into the middle these three things, cedar wood and hyssop and scarlet wool. Then if it is quite extinguished, a clean man is to collect the ashes and deposit them outside the city in a clean place.</p></div>



<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="269"><p>
<note n="7.255.b">Here the juxtaposition of the clean man shews that Philo must have taken καθαρῷ χωρίῳ as “clean,” and not as “open,” though it does not follow that he did so in the passages cited in the note on <hi rend="italic">Mos.</hi> ii. 72, or even in § 232 above.</note>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="270"><p> He, then, who is

But anyone whose heart is the seat of lurking covetousness and wrongful cravings should remain still and hide his face in confusion and curb the shameless madness which would rashly venture where caution is profitable. For the holy place of the truly Existent is closed ground to the unholy.</p></div>



<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="271"><p> To such a one I would 



say, “Good sir, God does not rejoice in sacrifices even if one offer hecatombs, for all things are His possessions, yet though He possesses
<note n="7.257.a">I understand the connexion of thought to be “though He possesses all, He needs it not, and therefore how much more are the gifts of men unneeded.”</note>
  He needs none of them, but He rejoices in the will to love Him and in men that practise holiness, and from these He accepts plain meal or barley,
<note n="7.257.b">Or “barley ground or unground.”</note>
  and things of least price, holding them most precious rather than those of highest cost.”</p></div>



<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="272"><p> And indeed though the worshippers bring 



nothing else, in bringing themselves they offer the best of sacrifices, the full and truly perfect oblation of noble living,

The “unhewn stones” seems to be drawn from Ex. xx. 25, “And if thou make me an altar of stone thou shalt not build it of hewn stones.” Philo’s description may be derived from personal observation, for Josephus, <hi rend="italic">Contra Apion</hi>. i. 198 quotes a passage ascribed to Hecataeus (4th–3rd century LXX), in which he states, when speaking of the temple at Jerusalem, that the altar is built of heaped up stones unhewn and unwrought. But see App. pp. 621–622.</note>
  For one of these was 



built of stones picked up and left unhewn, and it was set in the open air beside the avenues to the sanctuary and was to be used for blood-offerings. The other was formed of the purest gold; it was set in the inner shrine within the first veil, not to be seen by any except such priests as were in a state of purity,
<note n="7.259.b">And therefore permitted to officiate.</note>
  and it was to be used for frankincense-offerings.</p></div>



<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="275"><p> This 



clearly shews that even the least morsel of incense offered by a man of religion is more precious in the sight of God than thousands of cattle sacrificed by men of little worth. For as gold is better than casual stones and all in the inner shrine more sacred than what stands outside, so and in the same measure is the thank-offering of incense superior to that of the blood of beasts.</p></div>



<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="276"><p> And therefore the altar of incense 



receives special honour, not only in the costliness of its material, its construction and its situation, but by taking every day the earlier place in subserving the thanksgiving which men render to God. For it is not permitted to bring the victim of the whole-burnt-offering outside until the incense has been offered







<pb n="261"/>





inside at the first glimpse of day.</p></div>



<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="277"><p>
<note n="7.261.a">The same statement has been made in § 171. See Ex. xxx. 7, where the LXX says that the incense-offering is to be made πρωῒ πρωΐ, which Philo presumably takes as = βαθὺς ὄρθρος, and earlier than the πρωΐ of Ex. xxix. 39 and Num. xxviii. 4 (which he renders here and in § 169 by ἅμα τῇ ἕῳ). The statement in § 171 that the evening incense-offering was <hi rend="italic">after</hi> the evening sacrifice would seem to be opposed to the argument in this passage.</note>
   The 



symbolical meaning is just this and nothing else: that what is precious in the sight of God is not the number of victims immolated but the true purity of a rational spirit in him who makes the sacrifice. Can you think that if the judge whose heart is set on giving righteous judgement will not take gifts from any of the litigants, or if he does take them will be open to the charge of bribery; if again the good. man will not receive them from the bad, though both are men, and the one perhaps in need and the other rich—can you think, I say, that God can be corrupted, God Who is absolutely sufficient to Himself and needs nothing of anything created, and being as He is the primal good, the consummation of perfection, the perennial fountain of wisdom and justice and every virtue, turns His face from the gifts of the unjust?</p></div>

<note n="7.263.a">The heading here introduced in MSS., “Of bringing the hire of a harlot into the temple,” is of course in copies which do not transfer these sections as described in note 1 quite absurd. The point of the harlot’s hire is merely introduced as an illustration of the moral enforced.</note>
  There is a very excellent ordinance inscribed in 



the sacred tables of the law, that the hire of a harlot should not be brought into the temple;
<note n="7.263.b">See Deut. xxiii. 18.</note>
  the hire, that is, of one who has sold her personal charms and chosen a scandalous life for the sake of the wages of shame.</p></div>



<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="281"><p> But if the gifts of one who has played the

What length of time can purge away the stains of these? None, to my knowledge.</p></div>



<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="282"><p> The harlots’ traffic indeed is 



often brought to a close by old age, since when the freshness of their charm is passed, all cease to seek them now that their bloom is faded like the bloom of flowers.

Not even the longest, but only God, with Whom that is possible which is impossible with us.</p></div>

but whether his own mind stands free from defect and imperfection. Further, let him examine the motives which determine him to make the offering. For either he is giving thanks for benefits already received or is asking for security in his tenure of present blessings or for acquisition of others to come, or for deliverance from evils, either present or expected, and all these demand that he should put himself into a condition of mental health and safety.</p></div>



<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="284"><p> For if he is offering thanks for what has already been

<note n="7.265.a">The heading here introduced, “Of the other matters concerning the altar,” which, as no later heading is given, presumably extends to the rest of the treatise, is almost as absurd as the last. At the best it only serves for a description of §§ 285–295. In §§ 296–298 we pass on to the lamps, and after that to general reflections on the morality enjoined in the cult. Cohn ignores both this and the preceding heading in his numeration of chapters.</note>
  The fire on the altar, he tells us, will burn 



continuously and not be extinguished.
<note n="7.265.b">See Lev. vi. 9, 12, 13.</note>
  That, I think, is natural and fitting, for since the gracious gifts of God granted daily and nightly to men are perennial, unfailing and unceasing, the symbol of thankfulness also, the sacred flame, should be kept alight and remain unextinguished for ever.</p></div>



<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="286"><p> Perhaps 



also he wishes in this way to employ the abiding presence of the same fire by which all the sacrifices are consecrated to unite them, old and new alike,
<note n="7.265.c">i.e. those of the past, and those of the present and future.</note>
  and thus shew that they carry out perfectly the duty









<pb n="267"/>





of giving thanks, however numberless are the differences in the resources on which they are based, according as the oblations are lavishly abundant or on the other hand scanty.</p></div>



<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="287"><p>  This is the 



literal account: the inner meaning must be observed by the laws of allegory. The true altar of God is the thankful soul of the Sage, compacted of perfect virtues unsevered
<note n="7.267.a">An allusion to the unhewn stones of which the altar was built; see § 274.</note>
  and undivided, for no part of virtue is useless.</p></div>



<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="288"><p> On this soul-altar the sacred light is ever 



burning and carefully kept unextinguished, and the light of the mind is wisdom, just as the darkness of the soul is folly. For knowledge is to the reason what the light of our senses is to the eye: as that gives the apprehension of material things, so does knowledge lead to the contemplation of things immaterial and conceptual, and its beam shines for ever, never dimmed nor quenched.

</p></div>



<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="289"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="53"/> After this he says, “On every gift ye shall 



offer salt,”
<note n="7.267.b">See Lev. ii. 13.</note>
  by which he signifies, as I have said before, complete permanence. Salt acts as a preservative to bodies, ranking in this as second in honour to the life-principle. For just as the life-principle causes bodies to escape corruption, so does salt, which more than anything else keeps them together and makes them in a sense immortal.</p></div>



<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="290"><p> From the same point of 



view he called the altar a sacrifice-keeper,
<note n="7.267.c">τηρεῖν = “keep,” θυσίας = “sacrifices.” Cf. <hi rend="italic">Mos.</hi> ii. 106.</note>
  evidently giving it that special and distinctive name from its preserving the sacrifices, though the flesh is consumed by fire. And thus we have the clearest proof that he holds the sacrifice to consist not in the victims but in the offerer’s intention and his zeal which derives









<pb n="269"/>





its constancy and permanence from virtue.</p></div>



<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="291"><p> He adds, too, a further enactment by which he orders 



every sacrifice to be offered without honey or leaven.</p></div>



<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="292"><p>
<note n="7.269.a">See Lev. ii. 11.</note>
  Both these substances he considers unfit to be brought to the altar: honey perhaps because the bee which collects it is an unclean animal, bred from the putrescence and corruption of dead oxen, we are told, just as wasps are from the carcasses of horses
<note n="7.269.b">See App. p. 622.</note>
 ; or else he forbids it as a symbol of the utter unholiness 



of excessive pleasure which tastes sweet as it passes through the throat but afterwards produces bitter and persistent pains which of necessity shake and agitate the soul and make it unable to stand firmly in its place.</p></div>



<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="293"><p> Leaven is forbidden because of the 



rising which it produces. Here again we have a symbol of the truth, that none as he approaches the altar should be uplifted or puffed up by arrogance; Rather gazing on the greatness of God, let him gain a perception of the weakness which belongs to the creature, even though he may be superior to others in prosperity; and having been thus led to the reasonable conclusion, let him reduce the overweening exaltation of his pride by laying low that pestilent enemy, conceit.</p></div>



<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="294"><p> For if the Creator and Maker of the 



universe, though needing nothing of all that He has begotten, has regard to your weakness and not to the vastness of His might and sovereignty, makes you a partaker in His gracious power and fills up the deficiencies that belong to your life, how ought you to treat other men, your natural kinsfolk, seedlings from the same elements as yourself, you who brought nothing into the world, not even yourself?</p></div>

you again depart, and the span of time between your birth and death is a loan to you from God. During this span what can be meet for you to do but to study fellow-feeling and goodwill and equity and humanity and what else belongs to virtue, and to cast away the inequitable, unrighteous and unforgiving viciousness which turns man, naturally the most civilized of creatures, into a wild and ferocious animal!

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="296"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="54"/> Again he commands that the lamps on the 



sacred candlestick within the veil should be kept burning from evening till early morning.
<note n="7.271.a">See Ex. xxvii. 21, Lev. xxiv. 3, 4.</note>
  He has several objects in this. One is, that the holy places should be illuminated when the daylight leaves them and thus remain ever exempt from darkness, in this resembling the stars. For they when the sun has set display their own light instead and do not forsake their place in the cosmic order.</p></div>



<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="297"><p>  A second 



object was, that at night-time also some rites of the same kith and kin as those of the day-time should be performed for the service of God, and that no time or season should omit its thanksgiving. And to shew our thankfulness the sacrificial offering, for sacrificial it may quite properly be called, most suitable and appropriate to the night is the radiance of that most sacred light in the inner shrine.</p></div>



<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="298"><p> There is a third 



reason, a very cogent one: Not only in our waking hours do we experience blessings, but also in our slumbers. For God the bountiful has provided our mortal race with a great support in the form of sleep, whereby both body and soul are benefited. The body is released from the labours of the day, the soul relaxes its anxious cares and retreats into itself, away from the press and clamour of the senses, and can then, if at no other time, enjoy privacy and commune



<pb n="273"/>





with itself. Rightly therefore did the law determine so to apportion the thank-offerings that thankfulness is expressed for our waking time by the victims brought to the altar, for sleep and the benefits which it gives by the lighting of the sacred lamps.

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="299"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="55"/> These and similar injunctions to piety are 



given in the law in the form of direct commands and prohibitions. Others which have now to be described are of the nature of homilies giving admonitions and exhortations. Addressing himself to the mind of man he says,
<note n="7.273.a">Here Philo begins his homily on the moral and religious lessons in Deuteronomy. See Deut. x. 12 f.</note>
  “God asks nothing from thee that is heavy or complicated or difficult, but only something quite simple and easy.</p></div>



<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="300"><p> And this is just to love Him 



as a benefactor, or failing this to fear Him at least as a ruler and lord, and to tread in every way that will lead thee to please Him, to serve Him not halfheartedly but with thy whole soul filled with the determination to love Him and to cling to His commandments and to honour justice.”

<note n="7.273.b">That the rest of this section from “Among all these” cannot possibly be in its right place, as it is quite irrelevant to the context, is, as Cohn and Heinemann agree, quite indisputable. But it seems to me that it does not make sense in itself, and that Heinemann’s admission that it is not “ganz klar” understates the facts. As Cohn prints it, as indicated in the textual notes, it appears to state that all the other parts of the universe (except God?) “have betterment,” and to illutrate this we are told that the mountains rise to a very great height, the plains get wider, etc. (In this part it is hard to see why ἤ is used instead of καί.) At the end it appears that contrary to what has been said (μὲν οὖν) they remain exactly as they were from the first.</note>

such parts of the subject as admit of being studied in a figurative sense. We should know, then, that nature’s right reasoning has the functions both of a father and a husband, though the conceptions attached to each are different. It acts as a husband because it deposits the seed of virtue in the soul as in a fertile field. It acts as a father because its nature is to beget good intentions and noble and worthy actions, and then to foster its offspring with the water of the truths which education and wisdom abundantly supply.</p></div>



<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="30"><p> The mind is likened on the one hand to a 



virgin, on the other to a woman either in widowhood, or still united to a husband. As a virgin it keeps itself pure and uncorrupted from the malignant passions, pleasures and desires and griefs and fears. Over this virgin mind the father who begat it has assumed authority. But when, like a wife, it dwells with virtuous reasoning as its worthy mate, that same reasoning promises to take charge of it and impregnates it husband-like with thoughts of highest excellence.</p></div>

It has none to heal its errors, no reasoning of wisdom, either to live with it as its husband or to act as its father and begetter.

equally, the sole distinctions made being between men and women and between children and adults.</p></div>



<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="33"><p> It ordained that from 20 years to 60 a man should be

  For livestock we have the following. If a man sets apart a beast from his stock, if it is a clean specimen of one of the three kinds which are allowed for sacrifice, an ox or sheep or goat, he must sacrifice that particular animal without substituting either a better for a worse or a worse for a better. For God does not delight in the

fleshiness or fatness of animals, but in the blameless intention of the votary. But if he does make any exchange, he must consecrate two instead of one, both the original and its substitute.</p></div>



<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="36"><p> If he has vowed any 



of his unclean cattle, he must bring it to the most highly esteemed of the priests,
<note n="7.329.a">In Leviticus simply “the priest.”</note>
  who must assess it not exceeding its proper value and then add a fifth part of that value, so that if a clean animal has to be provided for the sacrifice instead of this one, what is provided may not fall short of the proper value.
<note n="7.329.b">The meaning of the rule seems to be that if the animal cannot be lawfully dedicated, its owner may sell it for the price fixed by the priest, and give the money, but if he redeems it he must pay the extra fifth. The question of providing a clean animal in its stead does not appear to be considered.</note>
  Further, the intention is to discomfit the votary for having made a vow without reflection under the impression that the impure animal was on this occasion pure, a mistake presumably due to some mental aberration which powerfully affected him.</p></div>

 If the votary determines to redeem the house, he must spend more freely and add a fifth as a punishment for two bad things, thoughtlessness and lust of possession, the former shown in the matter of his vow, the latter in his desire to regain what he had surrendered.

The other which flows from it is a mixed stream blended with lesser tributaries of sorrow, and if the blend is such that the pleasant ingredients outnumber the unpleasant, the wise man receives it as the greatest of gifts. So much for this matter.

has neither beginning nor end, the second to be observed is the sacred seventh day, recurring with six days between. Some have given to it the name of virgin,

  having before their eyes its surpassing chastity. They also call her the motherless,
<note n="7.343.a">See on <hi rend="italic">De Dec.</hi> 102.</note>
  begotten by the father of the universe alone, the ideal form of the male sex with nothing of the female. It is the manliest and doughtiest of numbers, well gifted by nature for sovereignty and leadership. Some give it the name of the “season”
<note n="7.343.b">Alternatives for translating the untranslatable καιρός might be “the right season,” “the happy hour or moment,” or the abstract “timeliness.” Heinemann gives “die entscheidende Zeit.” In <hi rend="italic">De Op.</hi> 59 καιρός is defined as χρόνοι κατορθώσεως. The application of it to the number seven is, like the other names, Pythagorean. As Philo understands it here, we may perhaps say that it is personified like τύχη, of which it is the converse, and represents the due order in which events happen. See further App. p. 624.</note>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="57"><p> For seven is a factor common to all the 



phenomena which stand highest in the world of sensible things and serve to consummate in due order transitions of the year and recurring seasons. Such are the seven planets, the Great Bear, the Pleiades and the cycles of the moon, as it waxes and wanes,





<pb n="345"/>





and the movements, harmonious and grand beyond description, of the other heavenly bodies.</p></div>



<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="58"><p> But 



Moses from a higher point of view gave it the name of completion and full perfection when he laid down six as the number under which the parts of the universe were brought into being, seven as that under which they were perfected. For six is even-odd, formed out of twice three with the odd part as its male element and the even as its feminine, and these two, by the immutable laws of nature, are the sources of generation.</p></div>



<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="59"><p> But seven is a number entirely 



uncompounded, and may be quite properly described as the light of six. For seven reveals as completed what six has produced, and therefore it may be quite rightly entitled the birthday of the world,
<note n="7.345.a">Cf. <hi rend="italic">Mos.</hi> i. 207 (and note), and ii. 210.</note>
  whereon the Father’s perfect work, compounded of perfect parts, was revealed as what it was.</p></div>



<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="60"><p>  On this day we are commanded 



to abstain from all work, not because the law inculcates slackness; on the contrary it always inures men to endure hardship and incites them to labour, and spurns those who would idle their time away, and accordingly is plain in its directions to work the full six days. Its object is rather to give men relaxation from continuous and unending toil and by refreshing their bodies with a regularly calculated system of remissions, to send them out renewed to their old activities. For a breathing-space enables not merely ordinary people but athletes also to collect their strength and with a stronger force behind them to undertake promptly and patiently each of the tasks set before them.</p></div>



<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="61"><p> Further, when He forbids bodily labour 



on the seventh day, He permits the exercise of



<pb n="347"/>





the higher activities, namely, those employed in the study of the principles of virtue’s lore. For the law bids us take the time for studying philosophy and thereby improve the soul and the dominant mind.</p></div>



<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="62"><p> So each seventh day there stand wide open 



in every city thousands of schools of good sense, temperance, courage, justice and the other virtues in which the scholars sit in order quietly with ears alert and with full attention, so much do they thirst for the draught which the teacher’s words supply, while one of special experience rises and sets forth what is the best and sure to be profitable and will make the whole of life grow to something better.</p></div>



<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="63"><p> But among the vast number of particular truths and 



principles there studied, there stand out practically
<note n="7.347.a">The meaning of ὡς ἔπος εἰπεῖν is not quite clear. Generally, if not always, it is applied to a general statement, mostly numerical, to indicate that it is not exact. Perhaps it may mean here that it would be possible to find more than two main heads, or other than these two. Heinemann translates “so zu sagen,” but I do not see what this means here, even if the Greek can be so translated.</note>
  high above the others two main heads: one of duty to God as shewn by piety and holiness, one of duty to men as shewn by humanity and justice, each of them splitting up into multiform branches, all highly laudable.</p></div>



<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="64"><p> These things shew clearly that Moses 



does not allow any of those who use his sacred instruction to remain inactive at any season. But since we consist of body and soul, he assigned to the body its proper tasks and similarly to the soul what falls to its share, and his earnest desire was, that the two should be waiting to relieve each other. Thus while the body is working, the soul enjoys a respite, but when the body takes its rest, the soul resumes its work, and thus the best forms of life, the theoretical and the practical, take their turn in replacing each other. The practical life has six as





<pb n="349"/>





its number allotted for ministering to the body. The theoretical has seven for knowledge and perfection of the mind.

<note n="7.349.c">For §§ 66–69 see Ex. xx. 10.</note>
  But it would 



seem that his further enactments were given for the sake of the more disobedient who refused to pay attention to his commandments, when he not only requires the free men to abstain from work on the Sabbath, but gives the same permission to men-servants and handmaids, and sends them a message of security and almost of freedom after every six days, to teach both masters and men an admirable lesson.</p></div>



<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="67"><p> The masters must be accustomed to work 



themselves without waiting for the offices and attentions of their menials,
<note n="7.349.d">This seems to contradict both the foregoing and the commandment itself “neither thou . . . nor thy manservant, nor thy maidservant.” Philo perhaps means that there are wants which must necessarily receive attention, and that if this attention is rendered by oneself, it is not work in the sense of the commandment, but is work if rendered by another. Strict modern Sabbatarians would probably feel the same.</note>
  and so in the event of times of difficulty such as occur through the vicissitudes of human affairs, they may not through unfamiliarity with personal service lose heart at the outset and despair of accomplishing the tasks set before them, but use the different parts of their body with more nimbleness and shew a robust and





<pb n="351"/>





easy activity; while on the other hand the servants are not to refuse to entertain still higher hopes, but should find in the relaxation allowed after six days an ember or spark of freedom, and look forward to their complete liberation if they continue to serve well and loyally.</p></div>



<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="68"><p> But the result of this occasional 



submission of the free to do the menial offices of the slave, together with the immunity allowed to the slave, will be a step forward in human conduct towards the perfection of virtue, when both the seemingly distinguished and the meaner sort remember equality and repay to each other the debt incumbent on them.</p></div>



<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="69"><p>  But the holiday of 



the Sabbath is given by the law not only to servants but also to the cattle, though there might well be a distinction. For servants are free by nature, no man being naturally a slave,
<note n="7.351.a">See App. pp. 624–625.</note>
  but the unreasoning animals are intended to be ready for the use and service of men and therefore rank as slaves. Yet all the same, though it is their proper business to carry burdens and undergo toils and labour for their owners, they obtain their respite on the seventh days.</p></div>



<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="70"><p> There is 



no need to go through the rest of the list, when even the ox
<note n="7.351.b">The Deuteronomic version of the fourth commandment (v. 14) has “nor thine ox, nor thine ass, nor any of thy cattle.” So also LXX in Ex. xx. 10, though the Hebrew and E.V. have only “nor thy cattle.”</note>
  who serves the most useful and indispensable purposes in human life, namely ploughing when the soil is prepared for the sowing, and again thrashing when the sheaves are brought in for the purging of the fruit, is then kept free from the yoke and enjoys the birthday festival of the world. So universally has the sanctity of the day extended its influence.

</p></div>



<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="71"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="17"/> So high is the reverence which he assigns 





<pb n="353"/>





to the seventh day that other things which share in the qualities of the number are honoured in his estimation. Thus he lays down a rule for cancellation of debts in every seventh year,
<note n="7.353.a">See Deut. xv. 1–3.</note>
  both as a succour to the poor and as a challenge to the rich to shew humanity, in order that by giving some share of their own to the needy they may expect to receive the same kindness themselves, if any disaster befall them. Human vicissitudes are manifold, and life is not always on the same anchorage, but is like an unsteady wind, ever veering round to the opposite quarter.</p></div>



<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="72"><p> Now the best course would be that the creditors’

  He does not allow them to

<note n="7.353.d">Deut. xv. 3.</note>
  He distinguishes the two by calling the first by the appropriate name of brethren, suggesting that none should grudge to give of his own to those whom nature has made his brothers and fellow-heirs. Those who are not of the same nation he describes as aliens
<note n="7.353.e">E.V. “foreigner.”</note>
  reasonably enough, and the condition of the alien excludes any idea of partnership, unless indeed by a transcendency of virtues he converts even it into a tie of kinship, since it is a general truth that common citizenship rests on virtues and laws which propound the morally beautiful as the sole good.</p></div>

<note n="7.355.a">Ex. xxii. 25, Lev. xxv. 35–37, Deut. xxiii. 19; in the last passage lending money on interest to a foreigner is sanctioned.</note>
  for a person who borrows is not living on a superabundance of means, but is obviously in need, and since he is compelled to pay the interest as well as the capital, he must necessarily be in the utmost straits. And while he thinks he is being benefited by the loan, he is actually like senseless animals suffering further damage from the bait which is set before him.</p></div>



<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="75"><p> I ask you, Sir Moneylender, why do you

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="76"><p> And therefore no one sympathizes when

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="78"><p> Such a person may well pay the penalty

<note n="7.355.c">ἐργάζηται ἀτυχίας could in itself mean “create or produce misfortunes,” as heinemann seems to take it, though we should expect ἀνθρώποις, but the point is rather that he <hi rend="italic">uses</hi> people’s misfortunes. ἐργάζεσθαι, to “trade” or “make money,” is common enough, and there is a good parallel of this use with the accusative in Demosthenes, p. 794 τὰ τῶν ἄλλων κακὰ τοῦτον τρέφει . . .· ταῦτα γεωργεῖ, ταῦτα ἐργάζεται.

</p></div>



<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="79"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="18"/> After ordinances of this sort he follows 



them by laying down a law which breathes kindness and humanity throughout.
<note n="7.357.a">See Deut. xv. 12, which follows the passage discussed in §§ 71–73, from which the prohibition of usury was a digression. The limitation of slavery is also enforced in Ex. xxi. 2. But the use of the word “brother “ shews that it is Deuteronomy which he has in mind.</note>
  “If,” he says, “one of your brethren is sold to you, let him continue in slavery for six years but in the seventh be set free without payment.”</p></div>



<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="80"><p> Here again he uses the term 



brother of a fellow-national, and by this name indirectly sows in the soul of the owner the thoughts of his close relationship to the person in his power. It bids him not despise him as a stranger who has no charm to win his affection, but allow the lesson which the holy word suggests
<note n="7.357.b">For ὑπηχεῖν see note on <hi rend="italic">De Som.</hi> i. 164.</note>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="83"><p> Expel, then, from your soul that evil and 



malignant thing, arrogance. Deal with him as your hired servant, both in what you give and what you take. As for the latter, he will render you his services without the slightest backwardness always and everywhere without procrastination, and anticipate your orders with zeal and rapidity. And you must give him in return food and raiment and take care for his other needs. Do not harness him like an unreasoning animal nor oppress .him with weights too heavy and too numerous for his capacity, nor heap insults upon him, nor drag him down by threats and menaces into cruel despondency. Rather grant him time and places for respite according to some regular rule. For while “not too much of anything” is an excellent maxim in every case, it is particularly so as between masters and servants.</p></div>



<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="84"><p>

  When however 



you have received his services for the fullest term required, namely, six years, and when the truly sacred number of the seventh year is about to begin, grant his freedom to him who is naturally free and grant it without hesitation, my friend, and rejoice that you have found an opportunity of benefiting the highest of living creatures, man, in his chief interest.

Otherwise the same thing may happen again. He may be reduced by need to his old unhappy plight and compelled to undertake slavery again through lack of the means of life, and the boon you bestowed upon him may be cancelled. So much for the poor.

</p></div>



<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="86"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="19"/> Then follows a commandment to let the 



land lie fallow during the seventh year.
<note n="7.361.a">See Ex. xxiii. 11, Lev. xxv. 2 ff.</note>
  There are several reasons for this. In the first place he wished to give seven its honourable position in all the series in which time is measured, namely, days, months and years. For every seventh day is holy, a Sabbath as the Hebrews call it, and it is in the seventh month in every year that the chief of all the feasts falls, and therefore naturally the seventh year also has been marked out for a share in the dignity which belongs to the number. And there is this second reason.</p></div>



<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="87"><p> 



Do not, he says, be entirely under the power of lucre, but submit voluntarily to some loss, so that you may find it easy to bear some involuntary injury, if ever it should occur, instead of resenting it as some strange and alien misfortune and falling into despair. For some of the rich are so poor-spirited that when adversity overtakes them, they are as mournful and depressed as if they had been robbed of their whole substance.</p></div>



<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="88"><p> But among 



the followers of Moses all who have been his true disciples, trained in his excellent institutions from their earliest years, by allowing even rich territory to lie idle inure themselves to bear privations calmly and by the lesson of magnanimity thus learned voluntarily and deliberately to let even undoubted





<pb n="363"/>





sources of wealth fall almost from their very hands.</p></div>



<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="89"><p>
<note n="7.363.a">The correction suggested by Mangey and Heinemann (see note 2, p. 360) would make sacrificing revenues parallel to letting the land lie idle. I think the text is better as it stands. Leaving the land idle teaches the poorer to stand the privation, and the richer to sacrifice wealth voluntarily.</note>
   There is also, I think, this third suggestion, 



that men should absolutely abstain from putting any oppressive burden upon anyone else. For if the different parts of the earth which cannot share in any sensations of pain or pleasure yet have to be given respite, how much more must this be the case with men who not only possess the sense which is common also to the irrational animals but even the special gift of reason through which the painful feelings caused by toil and labour stamp and record themselves in mental pictures, more vivid than mere sensation!</p></div>



<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="90"><p> Let so-called masters therefore cease 



from imposing upon their slaves severe and scarcely endurable orders, which break down their bodies by violent usage and force the soul to collapse before the body.</p></div>



<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="91"><p> You need not grudge to moderate your 



orders. The result will be that you yourselves will enjoy proper attention and that your servants will carry out their orders readily and accept their duties not just for a short time to be abandoned through wearying too quickly, and, indeed, we may say, as if old age had prematurely overtaken them in their labours. On the contrary, they will prolong their youth to the utmost, like athletes, not those who fatten themselves up into full fleshiness, but those who regularly train themselves by “dry sweatings”
<note n="7.363.b">The allusion, which neither Cohn nor Heinemann notices, is to Plato, <hi rend="italic">Phaedrus</hi> 239 C, where ξηροὶ ἱδρῶτες are coupled with πόνοι ἀνδρεῖοι, and contrasted with ἁπαλὴ καὶ ἄνανδρος δίαιτα. The commentators take the phrase as meaning Sweats in the gymnasium as opposed to sweating in the baths, and so with the verb ξηραλοιφεῖν. Philo, however, does not use it in this sense, but for toil-enduring people in general who are in his eyes the true athletes. On the depreciation of athletes see App. pp. 625–626.</note>
  to acquire what is necessary and useful for life.</p></div>



<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="92"><p>  So too let rulers of cities cease from 





<pb n="365"/>





racking them with taxes and tolls as heavy as they are constant. Such rulers both fill their own coffers and while hoarding money hoard also illiberal vices which defile the whole of civic life.</p></div>



<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="93"><p>
<note n="7.365.a">I take αὐτῶν to refer to πόλεις, Heinemann apparently to the ἡγεμόνες.</note>
  For they purposely 



choose as tax-gatherers the most ruthless of men, brimful of inhumanity, and put into their hands resources for overreaching. These persons add to their natural brutality the immunity they gain from their masters’ instructions, and in their determination to accommodate every action to those masters’ pleasure they leave no severity untried, however barbarous, and banish mercy and gentleness even from their dreams.</p></div>



<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="94"><p> And therefore in 



carrying out their collecting they create universal chaos and confusion and apply their exactions not merely to the property of their victims but also to their bodies, on which they inflict insults and outrages and forms of torture quite original in their savagery.  Indeed, I have heard of persons who, actuated by abnormal frenzy and cruelty, have not even spared the dead, persons who become so utterly brutalized that they venture even to flog corpses with whips.</p></div>



<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="95"><p> And when anyone censured the 



extraordinary cruelty shewn in refusing to allow even death, the release and in very truth the “end” of all ills, to procure freedom from insult for those who are now beyond its reach, and in causing them to undergo outrage instead of the normal rites of burial, the line of defence adopted was worse than the accusation. They treated the dead, they said, with such contempt not for the useless purpose of insulting the deaf and senseless dust but in order to excite the pity of those who were related to them by birth or some other tie of fellowship, and thus



<pb n="367"/>





urge them to ransom the bodies of their friends by making a final gift in payment for them.

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="96"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="20"/> Foolish, foolish people, I would say to them, have you 



not first learnt the lesson which you teach, or are you competent to induce others to shew pity, even with the cruellest actions before them,
<note n="7.367.a">i.e. Philo thinks of the collectors as instructing the relatives on the duty of shewing pity, which they are incompetent to do, as they have no concertion of pity themselves. A simpler sense might be obtained, particularly if the question marks are dropped and οἳ read for ἢ—“Vilest of men, you have not first learnt the lesson which you teach; you know how to evoke pity, though with deeds of great cruelty, yet you have exscinded . . .”</note>
  when you have exscinded all kindly and humane feelings from your own souls? And this you have done, though you had no lack of good advisers, particularly in our laws, which have relieved even the land from its yearly tolls and provided it with a rest and respite.</p></div>



<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="97"><p>  This 



land, though to all appearance a lifeless thing, is put into a condition to make its requital and to repay a boon which it received as a free gift but is now eager to return.

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="98"><p> We may also note that the trainers 



of athletes take much the same line in dealing with their pupils. When they have thoroughly drilled them by an unbroken course of exercises, before they reach the point of exhaustion, they give them a fresh lease of life by providing relaxations, not only from the labour of the training itself but from the dietary regulations as to food and drink, the hardships of which they abate in order to make the soul cheerful and the body comfortable.</p></div>

of our laws had before his eyes when he proclaimed a rest for the land and made the husbandman stay his work after six years. But he gave this enactment not only on the grounds which I have mentioned but also moved by that habitual kindliness which he aims

at infusing into every part of his legislation, thereby impressing on the readers of the sacred scriptures the stamp of good and neighbourly customs.</p></div>



<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="105"><p> For he 



forbids them to close up any field during the seventh year.
<note n="7.371.a">Ex. xxiii. 11. In Lev. xxv. 6, 7 the produce of the seventh year is given as food for the household.</note>
  All olive-yards and vineyards are to be left wide open and so with the other kinds of property, whether of sown crops or orchard-trees, thus giving an unrestricted use of such fruits as are of natural growth to the poor quite as much, if not more so, than to the owners.</p></div>



<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="106"><p> Thus on the one hand he did 



not allow the masters to do any work of tillage because he wished to avoid giving them the painful feeling that they had incurred the expenditure but did not receive the income in return, and on the other hand he thought fit that the poor should for this year at any rate enjoy as their own what appeared to belong to others, and in this way took from them any appearance of humiliation or possibility of being reproached as beggars.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="110"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="22"/> While laying down this first foundation of 



moderation and humanity, he built on it by adding years to the number of seven times seven and consecrated the whole of the fiftieth year.
<note n="7.373.a">For the year of Jubile (§§ 110–123) see Lev. xxv. 8-end.</note>
  This he made the subject of many special enactments, all of remarkable excellence, apart from those which are common to other seventh years.</p></div>



<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="111"><p>
<note n="7.373.b">Cohn pronounces these words to be incurably corrupt and supposes them to express something like “confirming the sense of fellow-feeling.” I do not think the meaning I have given to them, “those which have a nature common to the others” (and are not ἐξαίρετα), is impossible, though the nearest example I can find, iii. 182 μηδεμίαν ἔχοντα κοινωνίαν, is not quite analogous. For παρά cf. παρὰ ταύτας § 216, and for the antithesis ἐξαίρετον—κοινός § 190. Mangey’s translation, lation, “supra ea quae ad vulgares annos pertinent,” is not unlike mine except that he takes παρά = “beyond,” and seems to see in κοινωνίαν the idea of ordinariness. If my view is right, the reference may be to Lev. xxv. 11, where the rules for the Sabbatical year are repeated, also to the liberation of slaves and remission of debts (cf. § 122).</note>
  The first of these 



enactments is as follows. He considers that alienated estates ought to be restored to their original possessors in order that the apportionments should be secured to the families and that no one to whom they had been allotted should be altogether deprived of the grant.</p></div>



<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="112"><p>
<note n="7.373.c">Lev. xxv. 14–16.</note>
  For since times of adversity often arise 



which make it necessary for some persons to sell their property, he made provision for the just needs of such persons and at the same time took steps to prevent the purchasers being deceived, by accompanying the permission to the vendors to sell with very clear instructions to the purchasers as to the







<pb n="375"/>





terms of the transaction.</p></div>



<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="113"><p> “Do not pay the price,” 



he says, “of complete ownership, but only for a fixed number of years and a lower limit than fifty.” For the sale should represent not real property but fruits, and this for two most convincing reasons. One is that the whole country is called God’s property,
<note n="7.375.a">Lev. xxv. 23.</note>
  and it is against religion to have anything that is God’s property registered under other masters. Another reason is that each of the holders has a portion assigned to him by lot, and that this should be taken from him is contrary to the law’s conception of justice.</p></div>



<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="114"><p> Anyone, therefore, who before the fifty years are 



completed has the means to recover his own property, or anyone else very closely related to him, is urged by the lawgiver to take every step to recover the land at the price which he got for it, and not to occasion loss to the purchaser who helped him at the time when he needed it.</p></div>



<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="115"><p> On the other hand he sympathized with 



the poor man and shewed him pity by restoring to him the additional wealth which he originally possessed, excepting fields which had been dedicated by a vow, and therefore rank with votive offerings.
<note n="7.375.b">Lev. xxvii. 16–21.</note>
  Religion forbids that time should affect the validity of a votive offering, and therefore it is ordained that the proper price for such estates should be demanded and that no concessions should be made to the votary.

</p></div>



<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="116"><p><milestone unit="para"/>XXIII These are the rules for cases where the 



apportionments and holdings consist of land. There are different regulations as to houses.
<note n="7.375.c">Lev. xxv. 29–31.</note>
  Houses in some cases belong to cities and are inside the walls, and others are farm-buildings in the country outside the walls. Consequently the law allows the latter to be redeemable at any time, and prescribes that any that have not been ransomed by the fiftieth year



<pb n="377"/>





should be restored without compensation to the former owner as in the case of real property, for farm-buildings are a part of real property.</p></div>



<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="117"><p> But houses within 



the walls may be recoverable by the vendors for the space of a year, but after the year are absolutely secured to the purchasers who are not liable to suffer any injury from the general remission in the fiftieth year.</p></div>



<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="118"><p> His reason is that he wishes to give the 



newcomers also a basis on which they may feel themselves firmly established in the country. For since they have no apportionment of land as they were not counted when the holdings were distributed, the law assigned to them their houses in fee simple in its anxiety that those who had come as suppliants and refugees to the laws should not be cast adrift.</p></div>



<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="119"><p> For when the land was apportioned according to the tribes 



the cities were not distributed, nor indeed built in city form at all, and the inhabitants took for their dwellings the outbuildings in the country. Subsequently when they left these and became concentrated as the feeling of unity and friendship naturally grew stronger in the course of many years, they built houses adjacent to each other, thus forming cities. And of these, as I have said, they assigned a share to the newcomers, to prevent them finding themselves cut off from holding property both in the country and in the cities.

</p></div>



<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="120"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="24"/> The legislation with regard to the consecrated 



tribe is as follows.
<note n="7.377.a">Lev. xxv. 32–34.</note>
  The temple-keepers were not allotted a section of land by the law, which considered that they were sufficiently provided for by the first-fruits, but assigned them instead forty-eight cities to dwell in, with a surrounding frontage in each case of two thousand cubits.</p></div>



<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="121"><p> Houses within 



these were not, like the others within the walls,



<pb n="379"/>





secured to the purchasers, if the vendors could not find the means to redeem them within the year, but were liable to be redeemed for an unlimited period just as the lay population
<note n="7.379.a">“Lay population” seems to be the meaning required for τοὺς ἀπὸ τοῦ ἔθνους, but I do not know of any similar use of ἔθνος. The phrase is used of the nation in general in i. 54. Possibly ἄλλου has fallen out. (Heinemann strangely translates it by “members of the other tribes,” with no hint as to how it is to be obtained from the Greek.)</note>
  could redeem the farm buildings, to which the dwelling-houses of the Levites correspond. For these were all that fell to their share in that great territory, and thus he considered that being once received they ought not to be taken back, any more than the farm-buildings in the case of those to whom the holdings were apportioned. So much for the subject of houses.

</p></div>



<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="122"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="25"/> Similar rules to those already stated are 



laid down as to the relations between creditors and debtors and between servants and masters.
<note n="7.379.b">Lev. xxv. 35–41. As Philo observes, the two sections really repeat the substance of §§ 71–85.</note>
  Creditors are not to exact interest from their fellow-nationals but to be content with recovering what they provided. Masters are to treat their purchased slaves as their hired servants, not as their slaves by nature, and give them secure access to liberty on the spot if they can provide their ransom, or in the case of the needy at a later time, when either the seventh year from the beginning of their slavery or the fiftieth arrives, in the latter case even though only a single day has elapsed since the man was reduced to that condition. For that time is accepted as the remission and actually is such, when all reverse their course and turn back to the prosperity of the past.</p></div>



<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="123"><p> But the law does permit the acquisition of slaves 



from other nations
<note n="7.379.c">Lev. xxv. 44.</note>
  for two reasons; first, that a distinction should be made between fellow-countrymen and aliens; secondly, that that most indispensable possession, domestic service, should not be absolutely







<pb n="381"/>





excluded from his commonwealth. For the course of life contains a vast number of circumstances which demand the ministrations of slaves.

</p></div>



<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="124"><p><milestone unit="para"/>
<note n="7.381.a">The sections which follow down to § 139 seem entirely out of place here and have nothing to do with the sequence of thought, which has hitherto carried him on from the Sabbath day to the Sabbatical year, and thence to the fiftieth year and the regulations connected with the last two. Cohn thinks that a connexion is to be found in Lev. xxv. 46, where after permitting the purchase of foreign slaves it continues “ye shall make them an inheritance” (LXX καταμεριεῖτε, “ye shall distribute”) “to your children.” If this is right, it can hardly be doubted, as Cohn says, that some words have fallen out which would shew the connexion.</note>
 The heirs of parents are to be sons,
<note n="7.381.b">See Num. xxvii. 8–11, <hi rend="italic">cf. Mos.</hi> ii. 243 ff.</note>
  or failing sons 



daughters. For just as in nature men take precedence of women, so too in the scale of relationships they should take the first place in succeeding to the property and filling the position of the departed which they have ceased to hold, debarred by an inevitable law which admits to immortality nothing that is mortal or earth-born.</p></div>



<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="125"><p> But if virgins are left 



without a dower, nothing of the kind having been settled on them by the parents while still alive, they should share equally with the males. The charge of protecting the girls left thus desolate and superintending their development, and the expenses of providing anything required for their maintenance and education as befits maidens should fall upon the head magistrate
<note n="7.381.c">Or “the chief civil authority.” See App. p. 626.</note>
 ; also when the time comes, the duty of arranging a suitable marriage and choosing husbands who are selected on their merits and approved in all respects.</p></div>



<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="126"><p> And these should be, if 



possible, of the same family as the girls, or if that cannot be, at any rate of the same ward and tribe, in order that the portions assigned as dowry should not

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="127"><p>
<note n="7.383.a">See Num. xxxvi. 6 ff. The point that they should, if possible, marry into the same family is not there expressly stated, but might be fairly inferred from <hi rend="italic">v.</hi> 11, where it is said that the daughters of Zelophehad married their first cousins. For “ward and tribe” see on § 82.</note>
  But if 



the deceased has no descendants, the brothers must proceed to the succession, for brothers rank next in tables of relationship with sons and daughters.

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="128"><p> But if 



kinsfolk are so scarce that no blood-relation remains, then the tribe shall be the heir.
<note n="7.383.b">Not stated in Num. xxvii. Probably (as Cohn and Heinemann) deduced from the intention of the law to prevent the inheritance passing from one tribe to another (xxxvi. 9).</note>
  For the tribe is in a sense a kinship with a wider and more all-embracing compass.</p></div>



<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="129"><p>
<note n="7.383.c">For §§ 129–132 <hi rend="italic">cf. Mos.</hi> ii. 244, 245.</note>
 One question, however, which 



is raised by some inquirers should not be passed over in silence. Why, they ask, does the Law when dealing with the regulations of inheritance mention kinsmen of every degree and fellow-wardsmen and fellow-tribesmen, but leaves parents alone unmentioned who would naturally inherit from the children as the children do from them? The answer, good sir, is that the law, God-given as it is, and ever desirous to follow the course of nature, held that no sinister thought should be introduced. Parents pray that they may leave behind them alive the children they have begotten to succeed to their name, race and property, and the imprecations of their implacable enemies are just the opposite, that the sons and daughters may die before their parents.</p></div>



<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="130"><p> Now he did not 





<pb n="385"/>





wish to speak plainly of anything so out of tune with and discordant to the harmony and concord which prevails throughout the cosmic order as the death of children while the parents survive, and there fore he complied both with necessity and decency
<note n="7.385.a">Cf. <hi rend="italic">Mos.</hi> ii. 245 καὶ τοῦ πρέποντος καὶ τοῦ μὴ τὴν οὐσίαν ἀλλοτριωθῆναι, which suggests that the “necessity” here is to keep the property in the family.</note>
  in not ordaining that mothers and fathers should inherit from their sons and daughters. He knew that such an event was not in accordance with the ordinary course of life or with nature.</p></div>



<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="131"><p> So while he avoided 



appointing the parents in undisguised terms as heirs to the property of their dead children, lest by assigning to them an acquisition of so undesirable a kind he should seem to be casting a slur upon their mourning or reminding them of their misfortunes, he adopted another way of conveying the ownership to them, a simple specific for a great mischief.</p></div>



<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="132"><p> What 



was this way? He declares the father’s brothers to be the heirs of their nephews, a privilege doubtless given to the uncle for the sake of the father, unless anyone is foolish enough to suppose that a person who honours A for the sake of B is deliberately dishonouring B. Is it the case that those who pay court to the acquaintances of their friends are neglecting those friends? Is it not rather the truth that their affectionate care for all that might honour these acquaintances
<note n="7.385.b">After τιμῇ <hi rend="italic">sc.</hi> τῶν γνωρίμων. But the whole sentence is very awkward and may contain some corruption besides the omission of οὐ. Heinemann’s translation, “lassen sie nicht die Ehrung ihrer Freunde in jeder Weise mit grösster Aufmerksamkeit angelegen sein,” does not seem to represent the Greek as it stands.</note>
  shews regard for the friends also? On the same principle the law, when it nominates the father’s brother to share in the inheritance because of his relationship to the father, much more nominates the father, not in actual words it is true for reasons already stated, but with a force more





<pb n="387"/>





recognizable than words, leaving no doubt of the intention of the lawgiver.

</p></div>



<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="133"><p><milestone unit="para"/>The eldest son does not share equally with his 



juniors, but is adjudged a double portion,
<note n="7.387.a">This statement is founded on Deut. xxi. 15–17. See App. pp. 626–627.</note>
  one reason being that his parents who before were but man and wife, owe to the first-born the fact that they have later become father and mother. Another is that it is their first-born who began to use these names in addressing his parents.
<note n="7.387.b">Cf. <hi rend="italic">Mos.</hi> i. 135.</note>
  The third reason is the most important, that what was before their birth a house of barren stock has become fruitful for the preservation of the human race, a preservation which is sown in marriage and fructified in the birth of children, starting with the eldest.</p></div>



<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="134"><p> This was the 



reason, I suppose, that the first-born sons of the enemies who had shewn themselves so merciless in action, were cut off in wholesale massacre in a single night, as the Holy Scriptures tell us, while the first-born of our nation were dedicated by consecration as a thank-offering to God. For it was just that on the enemy should fall the weight of a blow for which no consolation was possible, namely, the destruction of their foremost rank, while God Who wrought the salvation was honoured by the dedication as first-fruits of those who headed the line of children.</p></div>

 But there 



are some who after marrying and begetting children unlearn in their later days what they knew of self-restraint and are wrecked on the reef of incontinence. Seized with a mad passion for other women, they maltreat those who hitherto belonged to them and behave to the children they have begotten by them as though they were uncles rather than fathers, copy the unrighteousness shewn



<pb n="389"/>





by stepmothers to the first family and altogether devote themselves and all they have to the second wives and their children, overcome by the vilest of passions, voluptuousness. Such lusts the law would not have hesitated to bridle if it were possible, and prevent them from frisking and plunging still more.</p></div>



<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="136"><p> But since it is difficult, or rather impossible, to heal 



the frenzy goaded into savagery, it left the father to his fate as one in the grip of an incurable disease but did not disregard the son of the wife who was wronged through his passion for another, but bade him take the double portion in the distribution between the brothers.
<note n="7.389.a">For the allegorizing of this law (Deut. xxi. 15–17) <hi rend="italic">cf. De Sac.</hi> 20, <hi rend="italic">De Sob.</hi> 21 ff.</note>
  There are several reasons for this.</p></div>



<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="137"><p> In 



the first place, it punishes the culprit by forcing him to give good treatment to the person to whom he intended to give the reverse and renders him incapable of carrying out his ill-judged judgement. This it effects by conferring benefits on the person who was likely to suffer loss at his hands, and by taking upon itself the parental position which had been abandoned by the natural father in so far as the eldest child was concerned.</p></div>



<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="138"><p>  Secondly, 



it shews mercy and pity for the victims of injustice whom it relieves of a very grievous trouble by enabling them to share in the boon thus bestowed. For naturally we may suppose that the gratification felt by the son at obtaining the double portion is shared by the mother, encouraged as she is by the humanity of the law which refuses to allow her and her family to lie entirely at the mercy of her enemies.  And there was a third reason.</p></div>



<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="139"><p> 



Being gifted with a power to judge justly, it reflected that the father had bestowed his bounties generously on the children of the beloved wife



<pb n="391"/>





because of his affection for her, but left the children of the hated wife entirely out of consideration owing to his hostility to their mother, so that the former even in his lifetime inherited more than their equal share, and the latter might expect at his death to find themselves robbed of the whole patrimony. And therefore it decreed that the son of the discarded wife should have the eldest son’s privilege of the double share, in order to equalize the partition between both families.
<note n="7.391.a">i.e. in asserting the rights of the eldest son it asserts those of the first family as a whole.</note>
  Enough on these matters.

</p></div>



<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="140"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="26"/> Following the order stated above, we record 



the third type of feast which we will proceed to explain. This is the New Moon, or beginning of the lunar month,
<note n="7.391.b">For the New Moon see i. 177. Lit. “it, the new-month-day, according to the moon, the time” etc. i.e. the new moon is the time between the conjunctions. This, though unnoticed by Cohn and Heinemann, cannot, as it seems to me, have been stated by Philo. I suggest some such insertion as ἔστι γὰρ ὁ μὴν κατὰ σελήνην, which might easily have fallen out after the preceding κατὰ σελήνην. Nicetas, who resumes his excerpts here, has τρίτην ἑορτὴν ἀναγράφομεν τὴν κατὰ σελήνην νουμηνίαν. πρῶτον μὲν ὅτι κτλ. Of course in a country where non-lunar months are observed such an explanation is perfectly natural.</note>
  namely the period between one conjunction and the next, the length of which has been accurately calculated in the astronomical schools. The new moon holds its place among the feasts for many reasons. First, because it is the beginning of the month, and the beginning, both in number and in time, deserves honour. Secondly, because when it arrives, nothing in heaven is left without light, for while at the conjunction, when the moon is lost to sight under the sun, the side which faces earth is darkened, when the new month begins it resumes its natural brightness.</p></div>



<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="141"><p> The third reason is, that the 



stronger or more powerful element at that time supplies the help which is needed to the smaller and weaker. For it is just then that the sun begins to illumine the moon with the light which we perceive





<pb n="393"/>





and the moon reveals its own beauty to the eye. And this is surely an obvious lesson inculcating kindness and humanity and bidding men never grudge their own good things, but imitating the blessed and happy beings in heaven banish jealousy from the confines of the soul, producing what they have for all to see, treat it as common property, and give freely to the deserving.</p></div>



<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="142"><p> The fourth reason 



is, that the moon traverses the zodiac in a shorter fixed period than any other heavenly body. For it accomplishes that revolution in the span of a single month, and therefore the conclusion of its circuit, when the moon ends its course at the starting-point at which it began, is honoured by the law, which declares that day a feast, again to teach us an admirable lesson, that in the conduct of life we should make the ends correspond with the beginnings. And this will be effected if we keep our primitive appetites under the control of reason and do not permit them to rebel and riot like cattle that have no herdsman.</p></div>



<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="143"><p>  As for the services that the moon 



renders to everything on earth, there is no need to dilate upon them. The proofs are perfectly clear. As the moon increases, the rivers and fountains rise, and again diminish as it diminishes. Its phases cause the seas to withdraw and dwindle at the ebbtide, then suddenly rush back with the returning flood, and the air to undergo all manner of changes as the sky becomes clear or cloudy and alters in other ways. The fruits, both of the sown crops and orchard-trees, grow to their maturity according to the revolutions of the moon, which fosters and ripens everything that grows with the dewy and very gentle breezes









<pb n="395"/>





which it brings.</p></div>



<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="144"><p> But, as I have said, this is not the 



time to dwell at length on the praises of the moon and record and catalogue the services which it renders to living creatures and everything on earth. It is for these or similar reasons that the New Moon is honoured and obtains its place among the feasts.

</p></div>



<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="145"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="27"/> After the New Moon comes the fourth 



feast, called the Crossing-feast,
<note n="7.395.a">Philo consistently uses διαβατήρια or διάβασις = πάσχα, and several times, <hi rend="italic">e.g. Leg. All.</hi> iii. 94, allegorizes it as in § 147, shewing that he traces the name not to the passing over of the Israelites by the destroying angel (Ex. xii. 23 and 27), but to the crossing of Israel itself from Egypt, the type of the body, and no doubt also the crossing of the Red Sea. In classical Greek διαβατήρια are offerings made before crossing a boundary, and also (Plut. <hi rend="italic">Lucullus,</hi> 24) before crossing a swollen river; cf. § 147 ἐπικλύζει χειμάρρου ποταμοῦ τρόπον. See also App. p. 627.</note>
  which the Hebrews in their native tongue call Pascha. In this festival many myriads of victims from noon till eventide
<note n="7.395.b">See App. p. 627.</note>
  are offered by the whole people, old and young alike, raised for that particular day to the dignity of the priesthood.
<note n="7.395.c">Cf. <hi rend="italic">Mos.</hi> ii. 224.</note>
  For at other times the priests according to the ordinance of the law carry out both the public sacrifices and those offered by private individuals. But on this occasion the whole nation performs the sacred rites and acts as priest with pure hands and complete immunity.</p></div>



<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="146"><p> The reason for this is as follows: the 



festival is a reminder and thank-offering for that great migration from Egypt which was made by more than two millions
<note n="7.395.d">See Ex. xii. 37, “about six hundred thousand on foot that were men besides children” (LXX “besides the baggage”). So too, Num. xi. 21. “600,000 men implies a total including women and children of at least 2,000,000 souls” (Driver, <hi rend="italic">ad loc.</hi>)</note>
  of men and women in obedience to the oracles vouchsafed to them. Now at that time they had left a land brimful of inhumanity which made a practice of expelling strangers, and what was worst of all, assigned divine honours to irrational creatures, not merely domesticated animals, but even wild











<pb n="397"/>





beasts. So exceedingly joyful were they that in their vast enthusiasm and impatient eagerness, they naturally enough sacrificed without waiting for their priest.
<note n="7.397.a">The suggestion that the feast was instituted after the departure is, of course, quite opposed to Ex. xii., where the blood of the victim is to be smeared on the doorposts to avert the destroying angel.</note>
  This practice which on that occasion was the result of a spontaneous and instinctive emotion, was sanctioned by the law once in every year to remind them of their duty of thanksgiving. These are the facts as discovered by the study of ancient history.</p></div>



<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="147"><p>  But to those who are accustomed to turn literal facts 



into allegory, the Crossing-festival suggests the purification of the soul. They say that the lover of wisdom is occupied solely in crossing from the body and the passions, each of which overwhelms him like a torrent, unless the rushing current be dammed and held back by the principles of virtue.</p></div>



<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="148"><p>  On 



this day every dwelling-house is invested with the outward semblance and dignity of a temple. The victim is then slaughtered and dressed for the festal meal which befits the occasion. The guests assembled for the banquet have been cleansed by purificatory lustrations, and are there not as in other festive gatherings, to indulge the belly with wine and viands, but to fulfil with prayers and hymns the custom handed down by their fathers.</p></div>



<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="149"><p> The day on which 



this national festivity occurs may very properly be noted. It is the 14th of the month, a number formed of the sum of two sevens, thus bringing out the fact that seven never fails to appear in anything worthy of honour but everywhere takes the lead in conferring prestige and dignity.

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="150"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="28"/> With the Crossing-feast he combines one 



in which the food consumed is of a different and unfamiliar





<pb n="399"/>





kind, namely, unleavened bread, which also gives its name to the feast.
<note n="7.399.a">The feast of Unleavened Bread is regularly distinguished from the Passover, though following immediately after it. See Lev. xxiii. 5 ff., and also for the details mentioned below cf. i. 181 f.</note>
  This may be regarded from two points of view, one peculiar to the nation, referring to the migration just mentioned, the other universal, following the lead of nature, and in agreement with the general cosmic order. To show that this affirmation is absolutely true, will require some examination. This month comes seventh in order and number as judged by the cycle of the sun, but in importance it is first, and therefore is described as first in the sacred books.</p></div>



<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="151"><p>
<note n="7.399.b">See Ex. xii. 2, and note (App.) on i. 180.</note>
  The reason for this I 



believe to be as follows. In the spring equinox we have a kind of likeness and portraiture of that first epoch in which this world was created. The elements were then separated and placed in harmonious order with reference to themselves and each other. The heaven was adorned with sun and moon and the rhythmic movements and circlings of the other stars, both fixed and planetary. So too the earth was adorned with every manner of plants, and the uplands and lowlands, wherever the soil had depth and goodness, became luxuriant and verdant.</p></div>



<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="152"><p> So every year God reminds us of the creation of the 



world by setting before our eyes the spring when everything blooms and flowers. And therefore there is good reason for describing it in the laws as the first month because in a sense it is an image of the primal origin reproduced from it like the imprint from an archetypal seal.</p></div>



<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="153"><p> But the month of the 



autumnal equinox, though first in order as measured by the course of the sun, is not called first in the law,







<pb n="401"/>





because at that time all the fruits have been gathered in and the trees are shedding their leaves and all the bloom which the spring brought in its prime already scorched by the heat of the summer sun is wilting under the dry currents of air.</p></div>



<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="154"><p> And so to give the 



name of “first” to a month in which both uplands and lowlands are sterilized and unfruitful seemed to him altogether unsuitable and incongruous. For things which come first and head the list should be associated with all the fairest and most desirable things which are the sources of birth and increase to animals and fruits and plants, not with the processes of destruction and the dark thoughts which it suggests.</p></div>



<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="155"><p> The feast begins at the middle of the 



month, on the fifteenth day, when the moon is full, a day purposely chosen because then there is no darkness, but everything is continuously lighted up as the sun shines from morning to evening and the moon from evening to morning and while the stars give place to each other no shadow is cast upon their brightness.</p></div>



<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="156"><p>
<note n="7.401.a">Apart from the obvious faultiness of the text, the sentence is difficult. The stars, as Heinemann says, do not give place to each other on a night of full moon. He thinks that τῶν ἀστέρων refers to the sun and moon. I hardly think this is possible. Though we find the sun and moon coupled with the “other stars,” and included in the “seven stars,” there would be no point here in speaking of them as “the stars.” Presumably ἀλλήλοις ἀντιπαραχωρούντων is loosely used for “as one gives way to another,” and they are mentioned as reinforcing the light of the moon.</note>
   Again, the feast is held 



for seven days to mark the precedence and honour which the number holds in the universe, indicating that nothing which tends to cheerfulness and public mirth and thankfulness to God should fail to be accompanied with memories of the sacred seven which He intended to be the source and fountain to





<pb n="403"/>





men of all good things.</p></div>



<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="157"><p> Two days out of the seven, 



the first and the last, are declared holy. In this way he gave a natural precedence to the beginning and the end; but he also wished to create a harmony as on a musical instrument between the intermediates and the extremes. Perhaps too he wished to harmonize the feast with a past which adjoins the first day and a future which adjoins the last. These two, the first and the last, have each the other’s properties in addition to their own. The first is the beginning of the feast and the end of the preceding past, the seventh is the end of the feast and the beginning of the coming future. Thus, as I have said before,
<note n="7.403.a">In § 48.</note>
  the whole life of the man of worth may be regarded as equivalent to a feast held by one who has expelled grief and fear and desire and the other passions and distempers of the soul.</p></div>



<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="158"><p>  The 



bread is unleavened either because our forefathers, when under divine guidance they were starting on their migration, were so intensely hurried that they brought the lumps of dough unleavened,
<note n="7.403.b">So Ex. xii. 34, 39, and Deut. xvi. 3.</note>
  or else because at that season, namely, the springtime, when the feast is held, the fruit of the corn has not reached its perfection, for the fields are in the ear stage and not yet mature for harvest. It was the imperfection of this fruit which belonged to the future, though it was to reach its perfection very shortly, that he considered might be paralleled by the unleavened food, which is also imperfect, and serves to remind us of the comforting hope that nature, possessing as she does a superabundant wealth of things needful, is already preparing her yearly gifts to the human







<pb n="405"/>





race.</p></div>



<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="159"><p> Another suggestion made by the interpreters 



of the holy scriptures is that food, when unleavened, is a gift of nature, when leavened is a work of art. For men in their eagerness to temper the barely necessary with the pleasant, have learned through practice to soften by art what nature has made hard.</p></div>



<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="160"><p> Since, then, the spring-time feast, as I have laid down, 



is a reminder of the creation of the world, and its earliest inhabitants, children of earth in the first or second generation, must have used the gifts of the universe in their unperverted state before pleasure had got the mastery, he ordained for use on this occasion the food most fully in accordance with the season. He wished every year to rekindle the embers of the serious and ascetic mode of faring, and to employ the leisure of a festal assembly to confer admiration and honour on the old-time life of frugality and economy, and as far as possible to assimilate our present-day life to that of the distant past.</p></div>



<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="161"><p> These 



statements are especially guaranteed by the exposure of the twelve loaves corresponding in number to the tribes, on the holy table.
<note n="7.405.a">See Lev. xxiv. 5 ff.</note>
  They are all unleavened, the clearest possible example of a food free from admixture, in the preparation of which art for the sake of pleasure has no place, but only nature, providing nothing save what is indispensable for its use. So much for this.

</p></div>



<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="162"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="29"/> But within the feast there is another feast 



following directly after the first day. This is called the “Sheaf,”
<note n="7.405.b">See Lev. xxiii. 10 ff.; for “directly after the first day” <hi rend="italic">ibid</hi>. 11; LXX “on the morrow of the first day”; Hebrew “on the morrow after the sabbath.” See App. p. 627.</note>
  a name given to it from the ceremony which consists in bringing to the altar a sheaf as a first-fruit, both of the land which has been given to





<pb n="407"/>





the nation to dwell in and of the whole earth, so that it serves that purpose both to the nation in particular and for the whole human race in general.</p></div>



<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="163"><p> The 



reason of this is
<note n="7.407.a">Or “This follows from the fact that,” etc. For the following sections cf. i. 97, though there it is the high priest, and not the Jewish nation, who prays for the world. Heinemann notes that it is curious that the sections which follow emphasizing the world-priesthood of the Jewish race should be connected with the comparatively insignificant rite of the Sheaf, particularly as Philo in <hi rend="italic">De Som.</hi> ii. 75 has laid down that the sheaf must be taken from the holy land. But the sheaf is actually the first-fruit of the whole harvest, the accomplishment of which is celebrated in the feasts of Weeks and Tabernacles. Philo does not argue the world-priesthood from the rite, but asserts it as a fact shewn by (1) the obedience of Israel to the divine law; (2) its unique monotheism, and argues from it that the Sheaf, and by implication the other thank-offerings, are world-extensive. That he should attach this argument to the first example is not unnatural.</note>
  that the Jewish nation is to the whole inhabited world what the priest is to the State. For the holy office in very truth belongs to the nation because it carries out all the rites of purification and both in body and soul obeys the injunctions of the divine laws, which restrict the pleasures of the belly and the parts below it and the horde . . . setting reason to guide the irrational senses, and also check and rein in the wild and extravagant impulses of the soul, sometimes through gentler remonstrances and philosophical admonitions, sometimes through severer and more forcible condemnations and the fear of punishment which they hold over it as a deterrent.</p></div>



<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="164"><p>  But not only is the legislation in a sense 



a lesson on the sacred office, not only does a life led in conformity with the laws necessarily confer priesthood or rather high priesthood in the judgement of truth, but there is another point of special importance. There is no bound or limit to the number of deities, male and female, honoured in different cities, the vain inventions

of the tribe of poets and of the great multitude of men to whom the quest for truth is a task of difficulty and beyond their powers of research. Yet instead of all peoples having the same gods, we find different nations venerating and honouring different gods. The gods of the foreigner they do not regard as gods at all. They treat their acceptance by the others as a jest and a laughing-stock and denounce the extreme folly of those who honour them and the failure to think soundly shewn thereby.</p></div>



<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="165"><p> But if He 



exists Whom all Greeks and barbarians unanimously acknowledge,
<note n="7.409.a">This is a remarkable statement, and can hardly mean more than that all acknowledge a creator of some sort. In such a general statement he may perhaps ignore atheists, but the words are not easy to reconcile with what he says elsewhere of polytheists. Or does he think that all the theologies like the Greek and Roman acknowledged one God as above the rest?</note>
  the supreme Father of gods and men and the Maker of the whole universe, whose nature is invisible and inscrutable not only by the eye, but by the mind, yet is a matter into which every student of astronomical science
<note n="7.409.b">Heinemann translates by “Naturforschung.” But μαθήματα, where it is not used quite generally, seems regularly to indicate either mathematics as in § 177 below, or what was regarded as a branch of mathematics, astronomy or astrology.

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="166"><p> When they went 



wrong in what was the most vital matter of all, it is the literal truth that the error which the rest committed was corrected by the Jewish nation which passed over all created objects because they were created and naturally liable to destruction and chose

the service only of the Uncreated and Eternal, first because of its excellence, secondly because it is profitable to dedicate and attach ourselves to the elder rather than to the younger, to the ruler rather than to the subject, to the maker rather than to the thing created.</p></div>



<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="167"><p> And therefore it astonishes me to 



see that some people venture to accuse of inhumanity the nation which has shewn so profound a sense of fellowship and goodwill to all men everywhere, by using its prayers and festivals and first-fruit offerings as a means of supplication for the human race in general and of making its homage to the truly existent God in the name of those who have evaded the service which it was their duty to give, as well as of itself.

</p></div>



<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="168"><p><milestone unit="para"/>So much for this feast as a thanksgiving for the 



whole human race. But the nation in particular also gives thanks for many reasons. First, because they do not continue for ever wandering broadcast over islands and continents and occupying the homelands of others as strangers and vagrants, open to the reproach of waiting to seize the goods of others. Nor have they just borrowed a section of this great country for lack of means to purchase,
<note n="7.411.a">Cohn in <hi rend="italic">Hermes</hi>, 1908, p. 200, argues in justification of his correction (see note 4), that it fits in very well with the last words of § 170. This is true, but I cannot follow his dictum that μειονεκτεῖσθαι makes no sense. The nation was not like people who borrow or hire a piece of ground because they have not enough to buy it. μειονεκτεῖν is common enough, though I have not found an example of the middle. Heinemann translates μειονεκτεῖσθαι, though he calls the word corrupt.</note>
  but have acquired the land and cities for their own property, a heritage in which they live as long established citizens and therefore offer first-fruits from it as a sacred duty.</p></div>



<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="169"><p> Secondly, the land which has fallen 



to their lot is not derelict nor indifferent soil, but good land, well fitted for breeding domestic animals





<pb n="413"/>





and bearing fruits in vast abundance. For in it there is no poverty of soil and even such parts as seem to be stony or stubborn are intersected by soft veins of very great depth, the richness of which adapts them for producing life.</p></div>



<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="170"><p> But besides this it 



was no uninhabited land which they received, but one which contained a populous nation and great cities filled with stalwart citizens. Yet these cities have been stripped of their inhabitants and the whole nation, except for a small fraction, has disappeared, partly through wars, partly through heavensent visitations, a consequence of their strange and monstrous practices of iniquity and all their heinous acts of impiety aimed at the subversion of the statutes of nature. Thus should those who took their place as inhabitants gain instruction from the evil fate of others and learn from their history the lesson that if they emulate deeds of vice
<note n="7.413.a">The insertion of κακίας is very doubtful, and perhaps weakens the sense.

Mos.</hi> ii. 268 τοῦτ᾿ ἀπέβαινεν ἔργοις, (<hi rend="italic">b</hi>) emulate their actions.</note>
  they will suffer the same doom, but if they pay honour to a life of virtue they will possess the heritage appointed to them and be ranked not as settlers but as native-born.</p></div>



<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="171"><p>  We have shewn, then, that the Sheaf was an offering 



both of the nation’s own land and of the whole earth, given in thanks for the fertility and abundance which the nation and the whole human race desired to enjoy. But we must not fail to note that there are many things of great advantage represented by the offering. First, that we remember God, and what thing more perfectly good can we find than this? Secondly, that we make a requital, as is most fully due, to Him Who is the true cause of the good harvest.</p></div>



<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="172"><p> For the 



results due to the husbandman’s art are few or as good





<pb n="415"/>





as nothing, furrows drawn, a plant dug or ringed around, a trench deepened, excessive overgrowth lopped, or other similar operations. But what we owe to nature is all indispensable and useful, a soil of great fruitfulness, fields irrigated by fountains or rivers, spring-fed or winter torrents, and watered by seasonable rains, happily tempered states of the air which sends us the breath of its truly life-giving breezes, numberless varieties of crops and plants. For which of these has man for its inventor or parent?</p></div>



<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="173"><p> No, it is nature, their parent, who has not grudged to 



man a share in the goods which are her very own, but judging him to be the chiefest of mortal animals because he has obtained a portion of reason and good sense, chose him as the worthiest and invited him to share what was hers to give. For all this it is meet and right that the hospitality of God should be praised and revered, God Who provides for His guests the whole earth as a truly hospitable home ever filled not merely with necessaries, but with the means of luxurious living.</p></div>



<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="174"><p> Further, we learn not to neglect 



benefactors, for he who is grateful to God, Who needs nothing and is His own fullness,
<note n="7.415.a">Cohn supports his insertion of πλήρη from <hi rend="italic">Leg. All.</hi> i. 44 αὐτὸς ἑαυτοῦ πλήρης ὁ θεός, <hi rend="italic">cf. De Mut.</hi> 27.

  will thus become accustomed to be grateful to men whose needs are numberless.</p></div>



<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="175"><p>  The sheaf thus offered is 



of barley, shewing that the use of the inferior grains is not open to censure. It would be irreverent to give first-fruits of them all, as most of them are made to give pleasure rather than to be used as necessaries, and equally unlawful to enjoy and partake of any





<pb n="417"/>





form of food for which thanks had not been offered in the proper and rightful manner. And therefore the law ordained
<note n="7.417.a">There is no mention of barley in Lev. xxiii. As Josephus, <hi rend="italic">Ant.</hi> iii. 250, says the same, the use of barley had probably become a general practice, which Philo by a slip of memory ascribes to the law.</note>
  that the first-fruit offerings should be made of barley, a species of grain regarded as holding the second place in value as food. For wheat holds the first place and as the first-fruit of this has greater distinction, the law postponed it to a more suitable season in the future. It does not anticipate matters, but puts it in storage for the time being, so that the various thank-offerings may be adjusted to their appointed dates as they recur.

</p></div>



<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="176"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="30"/> The festival of the Sheaf, which has all 



these grounds of precedence,
<note n="7.417.b">Or “privileges.” If note <hi rend="italic">b</hi> on § 162 is right, the προνομίαι consist in this, that the Sheaf is the first to exhibit all the virtues which accompany thanksgiving and have been enumerated in the preceding sections. Certainly in no other sense does the law give προνομία to a rite which is disposed of in a few verses in Leviticus and not mentioned elsewhere in the Pentateuch.</note>
  indicated in the law, is also in fact anticipatory of another greater feast. For it is from it that the fiftieth day is reckoned, by counting seven sevens, which are then crowned with the sacred number by the monad,
<note n="7.417.c">i.e. the addition of 1 turns 49 into the sacred number 50. The use of ἐπισφραγίζεται in § 211 is exactly similar.</note>
  which is an incorporeal image of God, Whom it resembles because it also stands alone. This is the primary excellence exhibited by fifty, but there is another which should be mentioned.</p></div>



<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="177"><p> One reason among others which 



makes its nature so marvellous and admirable is that it is formed by what the mathematicians tell us is the most elemental and venerable of existing things,
<note n="7.417.d">Lit. “of what is included in existences.” The same view of 50 as the sum of the squares of the sides of the primary right-angled triangle appears in <hi rend="italic">De Vit.

  namely, the right-angled triangle. In length its









<pb n="419"/>





sides are 5, 3, 4, of which the sum is twelve, the pattern of the zodiac cycle, the duplication of the highly prolific six, which is the starting-point of perfection since it is the sum of the factors which produce it through multiplication. But we find that the sides when raised to the second power, <hi rend="italic">i.e.</hi> 3 x 3 + 4 x 4 + 5 x 5, make 50, so that we must say that 50 is superior to 12 in the same degree as the second power is superior to the first.</p></div>



<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="178"><p> And if the 



lesser of these is represented by the most excellent of the heavenly spheres, the zodiac, the greater, namely 50, must be the pattern of some quite superior form of existence. But a discussion of this would be out of place at this point. It is quite enough for the present to call attention to the difference, so as to avoid treating a prominent fact as of secondary importance.

</p></div>



<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="179"><p><milestone unit="para"/>The feast which is held when the number 50 is 



reached has acquired the title of” first-products.”
<note n="7.419.a">See on i. 183.</note>
  On it it is the custom to bring two leavened loaves of wheaten bread for a sample offering of that kind of grain as the best form of food. One explanation of the name, “Feast of First-products,” is that the first produce of the young wheat and the earliest fruit to appear is brought as a sample offering before the year’s harvest comes to be used by men.</p></div>



<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="180"><p> It is 



no doubt just and a religious duty that those who have received freely a generous supply of sustenance so necessary and wholesome and also palatable in the highest degree should not enjoy or taste it at all until they have brought a sample offering to the Donor, not indeed as a gift, for all things and possessions and gifts are His, but as a token, however small,





<pb n="421"/>





by which they show a disposition of thankfulness and loyalty to Him Who, while He needs no favours, sends the showers of His favours in never-failing constancy.</p></div>



<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="181"><p> Another reason for the name may be that wheaten 



grain is pre-eminent as the first and best product, all the other sown crops ranking in the second class in comparison; for as an archon in a city or a pilot in a ship are said to be the first because they regulate the course of the city or the ship, as the case may be, so wheaten grain has received the compound name of “first-product” because it is the best of all the cereals, which it would not be,
<note n="7.421.a">This is the only sense I can give to ἔδει γάρ (“it had to be”). Heinemann “bestimmt,” but would not this be ἔμελλε?</note>
  unless it were also the food used by the best of living creatures.</p></div>



<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="182"><p> The 



loaves are leavened in spite of the prohibition
<note n="7.421.b">Lev. ii. 11, cf. above i. 291. The meaning of what follows seems to be that the prohibition is waived in this case, because the loaves, though given to the Lord (Lev. xxiii. 20), are also received back from Him (“they shall be holy to the Lord for the priest that offers them”). It seems to be assumed that therefore they must be brought in the most palatable form, cf. § 184, presumably because it is a festal occasion, as the unleavened shew-bread was also eaten by the priests.</note>
  against bringing leaven to the altar, not to produce any contradiction in the ordinances, but to ensure that so to speak there shall be a single kind, both for receiving and giving. By receiving I mean the thanksgiving of the offerers, by giving the immediate return without any delay to the offerers of what they bring, though not for their own use.</p></div>



<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="183"><p> For food that has 



once been consecrated will be used by those who have the right and authority, and that right belongs to those who act as priests who through the beneficence of the law have the right to partake of any thing brought to the altar which is not consumed by the undying fire—a privilege granted either as a payment for officiating or as a prize for the contests which they endure in the cause of piety, or a sacred allotment in lieu of land, in the apportionment of





<pb n="423"/>





which they had not received their proper share like the other tribes.</p></div>



<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="184"><p>  But leaven is also a 



symbol for two other things: in one way it stands for food in its most complete and perfect form, such that in our daily usage none is found to be superior or more nourishing, and as wheat-meal is superior to that of the other seed crops, its excellence demands that the offering made in recognition of it should be of the same high quality.</p></div>



<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="185"><p> The other point 



is more symbolical. Everything that is leavened rises, and joy is the rational elevation or rising of the soul.
<note n="7.423.a">See App. p. 628.</note>
  And there is nothing that exists which more naturally gives a man joy than the possession in generous abundance of necessaries. Such rightly call forth gladness and thanksgiving in those who by the leavened loaves give outward expression to the invisible sense of well-being in their hearts.</p></div>



<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="186"><p>  The offering takes the form of loaves 



instead of wheaten meal,
<note n="7.423.b">Cohn’s rejection of ἀλλ᾿ οὐ σῖτος as “a foolish insertion” rests on the ground that the antithesis is between the wheaten loaves and other kinds of grain. I think he misapprehends the point, which is that when the harvest is completed by the reaping of the wheat, the offering naturally takes the form in which it is actually consumed. I suspect that Philo connects ἄρτος and ἄρτιος.</note>
  because when the wheat has come there is nothing still missing in the way of appetizing food. For we are told that of all the seed crops, wheat is the last to spring up and be ready for harvesting.</p></div>



<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="187"><p> And these thank-offerings of 



the best kind are two in number for the two kinds of time, the past and the future; for the past, because our days have been spent in abundance, free from the experience of the evils of want and famine; for the future, because we have laid by and prepared resources to meet it, and are full of bright

  when it is customary to sound the trumpet in the temple at the same time that the sacrifices are brought there, and its name of “trumpet feast” is derived from this. It has a twofold significance, partly to the nation in particular, partly to all mankind in general. In the former sense it is a reminder of a mighty and marvellous event which came to pass when the oracles of the law were given from above.</p></div>



<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="189"><p>
<note n="7.425.c">See Ex. xix. 16.</note>
  For then the sound of the trumpet pealed 



from heaven and reached, we may suppose, the ends of the universe, so that the event might strike terror even into those who were far from the spot and dwelling well nigh at the extremities of the earth, who would come to the natural conclusion that such mighty signs portended mighty consequences. And indeed what could men receive mightier or more profitable than the general laws which came from the mouth of God, not like the particular laws, through an interpreter?</p></div>



<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="190"><p>  This is a significance 



peculiar to the nation. What follows is common to all mankind. The trumpet is the instrument used in war, both to sound the advance against the enemy when the moment comes for engaging battle and also for recalling the troops when they have to separate and return to their respective camps. And there is another war not of human agency when nature is at strife in herself, when her parts make onslaught one on another and her law-abiding sense of equality









<pb n="427"/>





is vanquished by the greed for inequality.</p></div>



<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="191"><p> Both 



these wars work destruction on the face of the earth. The enemy cut down the fruit-trees, ravage the country, set fire to the foodstuffs and the ripening ears of corn in the open fields, while the forces of nature use drought, rainstorms, violent moisture-laden winds, scorching sun-rays, intense cold accompanied by snow, with the regular harmonious alternations of the yearly seasons turned into disharmony, a state of things in my opinion due to the impiety which does not gain a gradual hold but comes rushing with the force of a torrent among those whom these things befall.</p></div>



<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="192"><p> And therefore the law instituted this feast 



figured by that instrument of war the trumpet, which gives it its name, to be as a thank-offering to God the peace-maker and peace-keeper, Who destroys faction both in cities and in the various parts of the universe and creates plenty and fertility and abundance of other good things and leaves the havoc of fruits without a single spark to be rekindled.

</p></div>



<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="193"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="32"/> The next feast held after the “Trumpets” 



is the Fast.
<note n="7.427.a"><hi rend="italic">Cf.</hi> i. 186.</note>
  Perhaps some of the perversely minded who are not ashamed to censure things excellent will say, What sort of a feast is this in which there are no gatherings to eat and drink, no company of entertainers or entertained, no copious supply of strong drink nor tables sumptuously furnished, nor a generous display of all the accompaniments of a public banquet, nor again the merriment and revelry with frolic and drollery, nor dancing to the sound of flute and harp and timbrels and cymbals, and the other instruments of the debilitated and invertebrate kind of music which through the channel of the ears awaken the unruly lusts?</p></div>



<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="194"><p> For it is in these and 





<pb n="429"/>





through these that men, in their ignorance of what true merriment is, consider that the merriment of a feast is to be found. This the clear-seeing eyes of Moses the ever wise discerned and therefore he called the fast a feast, the greatest of the feasts, in his native tongue a Sabbath of Sabbaths,
<note n="7.429.a">So LXX, in Lev. xvi. 31 and xxiii. 32. In E.V. “a sabbath of solemn rest.”</note>
  or as the Greeks would say, a seven of sevens, a holier than the holy. He gave it this name for many reasons.</p></div>



<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="195"><p>  First, because of the self-restraint which it entails; 



always and everywhere indeed he exhorted them to shew this in all the affairs of life, in controlling the tongue and the belly and the organs below the belly, but on this occasion especially he bids them do honour to it by dedicating thereto a particular day. To one who has learnt to disregard food and drink which are absolutely necessary, are there any among the superfluities of life which he can fail to despise, things which exist to promote not so much preservation and permanence of life as pleasure with all its powers of mischief?</p></div>



<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="196"><p>  Secondly, because 



the holy-day is entirely devoted to prayers and supplications, and men from morn to eve employ their leisure in nothing else but offering petitions of humble entreaty in which they seek earnestly to propitiate God and ask for remission of their sins, voluntary and involuntary, and entertain bright hopes looking not to their own merits but to the gracious nature of Him Who sets pardon before chastisement.</p></div>



<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="197"><p>  Thirdly, because of the time at which the celebration 



of the fast occurs, namely, that when all the annual fruits of the earth have been gathered in. To eat and drink of these without delay would, he held, shew gluttony, but to fast and refrain from taking them as food shews the perfect piety which teaches



<pb n="431"/>





the mind not to put trust in what stands ready prepared before us as though it were the source of health and life. For often its presence proves injurious and its absence beneficial.</p></div>



<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="198"><p> Those who abstain from food 



and drink after the ingathering of the fruits cry aloud to us with their souls, and though their voices utter no sound, their language could hardly be plainer. They say, “We have gladly received and are storing the boons of nature, yet we do not ascribe our preservation to any corruptible thing, but to God the Parent and Father and Saviour of the world and all that is therein, Who has the power and the right
<note n="7.431.a">By θέμις is meant, perhaps, that it is in accordance with the law of His being. But the application of the word to God is strange, and I do not know of any exact parallel. οὐ θέμις, as in Plato, <hi rend="italic">Ap.</hi> 21 B οὐ γὰρ δήπου ψεύδεταί γε· οὐ γὰρ θέμις αὐτῷ, is not quite the same.</note>
  to nourish and sustain us by means of these or without these.</p></div>



<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="199"><p> See, for example, how the many thousands 



of our forefathers as they traversed the trackless and all-barren desert, were for forty years, the life of a generation, nourished by Him as in a land of richest and most fertile soil; how He opened fountains unknown before to give them abundance of drink for their use; how He rained food from heaven, neither more nor less than what sufficed for each day, that they might consume what they needed without hoarding, nor barter for the prospect of soulless stores
<note n="7.431.b">Lit. “the lifeless things which they would have stored.”</note>
  their hopes of His goodness, but taking little thought of the bounties received rather reverence and worship the bountiful Giver and honour Him with the hymns and benedictions that are His due.”</p></div>

number,
<note n="7.433.a">Cf. <hi rend="italic">De Dec.</hi> 20, 21. But the “detailed discussion” probably refers to a lost treatise on numbers. Cf. <hi rend="italic">Mos.</hi> ii. 115 τῇ περὶ ἀριθμῶν πραγματείᾳ, and <hi rend="italic">De Op.</hi> 52.</note>
  it is called by the learned the all-perfect, and embraces all the progressions, arithmetical, harmonic and geometrical, and further the harmonies, the fourth, the fifth, the octave and the double octave, representing respectively the ratios 4: 3, 3: 2, 2: 1 and 4: 1, and it also contains the ratio of 9:8, so that it sums up fully and perfectly the leading truths of musical science, and for this reason it has received its name of the all-perfect.</p></div>



<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="201"><p> In ordaining 



that this privation of food and drink should be based on the full and perfect number 10, he intended to prescribe the best possible form of nourishment for the best part of us. He did not wish anyone to suppose that as their instructor in the mysteries he was advocating starvation, the most intolerable of sufferings, but only a brief stoppage in the influx which passes into the receptacles of the body.</p></div>



<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="202"><p> For this 



would ensure that the stream from the fountain of reason should flow pure and crystal-clear with smooth course into the soul, because the constantly repeated administrations of food which submerge the body sweep the reason away as well, whereas if they are checked, that same reason stoutly fortified can in pursuit of all that is worth seeing and hearing make its way without stumbling as upon a dry firm causeway.</p></div>



<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="203"><p> Besides, it was meet and right when every- 



thing has shewn abundance as they would have it, and they enjoy a full and perfect measure of goodness, that amid this prosperity and lavish supply of boons, they should by abstaining from food and drink remind themselves of what it is to want, and offer prayers and supplications, on the one hand to ask that they may never really experience the lack of necessities, on the other to express their thankfulness



<pb n="435"/>





because in such wealth of blessings they remember the ills they have been spared. Enough on this matter.

</p></div>



<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="204"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="33"/> The last of the annual feasts, called 



Tabernacles, recurs at the autumn equinox.
<note n="7.435.a"><hi rend="italic">Cf.</hi> i. 189.</note>
  From this we may draw two morals. The first is, that we should honour equality and hate inequality, for the former is the source and fountain of justice, the latter of injustice. The former is akin to open sunlight, the latter to darkness. The second moral is, that after all the fruits are made perfect, it is our duty to thank God Who brought them to perfection and is the source of all good things.</p></div>



<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="205"><p> For autumn, or after- 



fruitage, is, as also the name clearly implies, the season after the ripe fruit has been gathered in, when the sown crops and the fruit-trees have paid their annual toll and bounden tribute, and the land has richly provided all that it yields for the sustenance of the various kinds of animals without number, both tame and wild, sustenance not only to be enjoyed on the spot and for the moment, but also in the future, through the foresight of nature, the friend of all that lives. </p></div>



<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="206"><p>Further, the people are commanded, during 206 the time of the feast, to dwell in tents.
<note n="7.435.b">See Lev. xxiii. 40-43.</note>
  The reason of this may be that the labour of the husbandmen no longer requires that they should live in the open air, as nothing is now left unprotected but all the fruits are stored in silos or similar places to escape the damage which often ensues through the blazing sunshine or storms of rain.</p></div>



<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="207"><p> For when the crops which 



feed us are standing in the open field, you can only watch and guard the food so necessary to you, by







<pb n="437"/>





coming out and not shutting yourself up like a woman who never stirs outside her quarters. And if while you remain in the open air you encounter extreme cold or heat, you have the thick growth of the trees waiting to shade you, and sheltered under them you can easily escape injury from either source. But when all the fruits are being gathered in, come in yourself also to seek a more weatherproof mode of life and hope for rest in place of the toils which you endured when labouring on the land.
<note n="7.437.a">This is the reason assigned in Leviticus, <hi rend="italic">l.c.</hi></note>
 Another reason may be, that it should remind us of the long journeyings of our forefathers in the depths of the desert, when at every halting-place they spent many a year in tents.</p></div>



<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="208"><p> And indeed it is well in wealth 



to remember your poverty, in distinction your insignificance, in high offices your position as a commoner, in peace your dangers in war, on land the storms on sea, in cities the life of loneliness. For there is no pleasure greater than in high prosperity to call to mind old misfortunes.</p></div>



<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="209"><p> But besides giving 



pleasure, it is a considerable help in the practice of virtue. For people who having had both good and ill before their eyes have rejected the ill and are enjoying the good, necessarily fall into a grateful frame of mind and are urged to piety by the fear of a change to the reverse, and also therefore in thankfulness for their present blessings they honour God with songs and words of praise and beseech Him and propitiate Him with supplications that they may never repeat the experience of such evils.</p></div>



<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="210"><p>  Again, the 



beginning of this feast comes on the fifteenth day of the month for the same reason as was given when





<pb n="439"/>





we were speaking
<note n="7.439.a">i.e. § 155.</note>
  of the season of spring,
<note n="7.439.b">One would expect ἰσημερίας or the omission of ὥρας, in which case ἑορτῆς would be understood. And so Heinemann, “Frühlingsfest.” But ὥρας may be justified perhaps on the ground that §§ 151 f. dealt rather with the spring as a whole than with the equinox in particular.</note>
  namely that the glorious light which nature gives should fill the universe not only by day but also by night, because on that day the sun and moon rise in succession to each other with no interval between their shining, which is not divided by any borderland of darkness.</p></div>



<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="211"><p> As a crown to the seven days he adds an eighth,
<note n="7.439.c">See Lev. xxiii. 36, Num. xxix. 35. This is “the last day, the great day of the feast” in John vii. 37. The word ἐξόδιον is used both in Leviticus and Numbers; E.V. “solemn assembly,” but in R.V. marg. “closing festival.”</note>
  



which he calls the “closing,” not meaning apparently that it is the closing of that feast only, but also of all the yearly feasts which I have enumerated and described. For it is the last in the year and forms its conclusion.</p></div>



<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="212"><p>  Perhaps also the number 



eight, the first cubic number, was assigned to the feast for the following reason: it is the beginning of the higher category of solids, marking where we pass from the unsubstantial and bring to its conclusion the category of the conceptual which rises to the solid in the scale of ascending powers.</p></div>



<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="213"><p>
<note n="7.439.d">For the general idea <hi rend="italic">cf. De Op.</hi> 98, where plane geometry (γεωμετρία) and solid geometry (στερεομετρία) are identified respectively with things incorporeal and corporeal, though the equation of ἀσώματα to νοητά is something of an extension. By δυνάμει, represented in the translation by “higher,” he means, perhaps, that solidity is gained by raising to a higher power in the mathematical sense = παραυξήσεσι below. But this technical use is generally, if not always, confined to the second power or square (as in § 177) and the meaning may be less technical = “in nature” or “value.” παραυξήσεσι is taken by Heinemann to mean the increase from 7 to 8. My preference for the rendering given above rests on the use of the plural (unless this may be accounted for by the plural νοητά). As I understand it, 1 = the point, 2 = the line, 4 = the superficies, and 8 = the solid. So in <hi rend="italic">De Op.</hi> 91, 93 and 94 παραυξηθείς and παραύξων are used of the processes by which 1 is raised by multiples of 2 to 64, and 3 to 729. See further App. p. 628.</note>
  And indeed the 



autumn festival, being as I have said a sort of complement
<note n="7.439.e">Here the word πλήρωμα, used in § 200 in the sense of sum or fullness, = that which fills up. For examples of both these senses see L.&amp; S. revised.</note>
  and conclusion of all the feasts in the year,







<pb n="441"/>





seems to have more stability and fixity, because the people have now received their returns from the land and are no longer perplexed and terrified by doubts as to its fertility or barrenness. For the anxious thoughts of the husbandman are never settled till the crops are gathered in, so numberless are the men and animals from whom they are liable to suffer harm.

</p></div>



<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="214"><p><milestone unit="para"/>All this long exposition is due to my regard for the 



sacred seventh day, and my wish to shew that all the yearly feasts prove to be as it were the children of that number which stands as a mother . . . scenes of folly and joy . . . and because the festal assemblies and the cheerful life which they afford bring delights that are free from all anxiety and dejection, and spread exhilaration both in the body and in the soul, in the body by the comfortable way of living, in the soul by the study of philosophy.

</p></div>



<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="215"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="34"/>
<note n="7.441.a">Here Cohn begins a fresh numeration of chapters. See Gen. Introd. p. xviii.</note>
 But besides these we have what is not a 



feast, but is a general ceremony of a festal character called the Basket, a name which describes what takes place, as we shall shortly shew.
<note n="7.441.b">See Deut. xxvi. 1-11. Cf. <hi rend="italic">Be Som.</hi> ii. 272.</note>
  That it has not the prestige and standing of a feast is clear for many















<pb n="443"/>





reasons. For it does not affect the nation as a united whole like each of the others, nor do we find any victim being brought or led to the altar and then sacrificed and given over to be consumed by the sacred and unquenchable fire, nor is there any specified number of days during which the feast is to last.

</p></div>



<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="216"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="35"/> But that it has a festal character and nearly 



approaches the form of a general ceremony
<note n="7.443.a">Presumably because though there is no general assembly everybody has to do it at some time.</note>
  can be easily seen. For every person who possesses farms or landed estates takes some of every kind of fruit and fills receptacles which, as I have said, are called baskets, and brings them with joy as a sample offering of his rich fruit-harvest, to the temple, and there standing opposite the altar, gives them to the priest. Meanwhile he recites this beautiful and admirable canticle, or if he does not remember it, he listens with all attention while the priest repeats it.</p></div>



<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="217"><p> The 



sense of this canticle is as follows: “The founders of our race abandoned Syria and migrated to Egypt and, though few in number, increased to a populous nation. Their descendants suffered wrongs without number from the inhabitants, and when no further assistance from men appeared forthcoming, became suppliants of God and sought refuge in His help.</p></div>



<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="218"><p> He 



Who is kindly to all the wronged accepted their supplication and confounded their assailants with signs and wonders and portents and all the other marvels that were wrought at that time, and saved the victims of outrage who were suffering all that malice could devise, and not only brought them forth











<pb n="445"/>





into freedom, but gave them a land fertile in every way.</p></div>



<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="219"><p> Of the fruits of this land we present a sample 



offering to Thee, our Benefactor, if indeed we may speak of presenting that which we receive. For all these things, good Master, are Thy boons and gifts, and as Thou hast judged us worthy of them, we take pride and delight in the unexpected blessings which Thou hast given us beyond all our hopes.”</p></div>



<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="220"><p> 





<milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="36"/> This canticle is used continually by a succession of worshippers from early summer to late autumn, through the two seasons which constitute a complete half of the year. For the whole population cannot in a body bring the fruits of the season at a fixed time, but must do so at different times, and this may even be the case with the same persons coming from the same places.</p></div>



<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="221"><p>
<note n="7.445.a">See note 1. The second of these suggestions, which is what Heinemann actually translates, seems to me quite pointless. I understand the text to mean that the same growers may find their fruits ripening at different times in different years. This of course in itself would prevent a fixed date for the ceremony.</note>
  For since some of the fruits 



ripen more quickly than others, both because of the difference of the situation which may be warmer or colder, and for a multitude of other reasons, naturally the time when this sample of the fruits is due cannot be exactly defined or limited, but extends over a very considerable period.</p></div>



<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="222"><p> These offerings 



are assigned for the use of the priests, because they have no territory allotted to them, nor property which brings them income, and their heritage consists of the offerings of the nation in return for the religious duties imposed upon them by night and day.

ated with it. In this I have followed the order of the principal heads set before us as the sequence of the subjects demanded. I now proceed to the next head, in which we find recorded a statement of the honour due to parents.

</p></div>



<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="224"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="38"/>
<note n="7.447.a">Here begins the fifth commandment. Again a fresh numeration of chapters in Cohn.</note>
 In my previous remarks I have sketched 



the four divisions which both in order and importance stand undoubtedly first. They comprise the assertion of the absolute sovereignty by which the universe is governed, the prohibition against making any image or likeness of God and against perjury or vain swearing in general and the doctrine of the sacred seventh day, all of them tending to promote piety and religion. I now proceed to the fifth, which states the duty of honouring parents, a matter which, as I have shewn in the discussion devoted to this in particular,
<note n="7.447.b"><hi rend="italic">i.e. De Dec.</hi> 106–120.</note>
  stands on the border-line between the human and the divine.</p></div>



<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="225"><p> For parents are midway between 



the natures of God and man, and partake of both; the human obviously because they have been born and will perish, the divine because they have brought others to the birth and have raised not-being into being. Parents, in my opinion, are to their children what God is to the world, since just as He achieved existence for the non-existent, so they in imitation of His power, as far as they are capable, immortalize the race.

</p></div>



<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="226"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="39"/> And a father and mother de- 



serve honour, not only on this account, but for many other reasons. For in the judgement of those who take account of virtue, seniors are placed above juniors, teachers above pupils, benefactors above beneficiaries, rulers above subjects, and masters above servants.</p></div>



<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="227"><p> Now parents are assigned a place 



in the higher of these two orders, for they are seniors



<pb n="449"/>





and instructors and benefactors and rulers and masters: sons and daughters are placed in the lower order, for they are juniors and learners and recipients of benefits and subjects and servants.  That none of these statements is false is self-evident, but logical proofs will ratify their truth still further.

</p></div>



<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="228"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="40"/> I say, then, that the maker is always senior to the 



thing made and the cause to its effect, and the begetters are in a sense the causes and the creators of what they beget. They are also in the position of instructors because they impart to their children from their earliest years everything that they themselves may happen to know, and give them instruction not only in the various branches of knowledge which they impress upon their young minds,
<note n="7.449.a">The translation does not do more than give the general sense. See note 2.</note>
  but also on the most essential questions of what to choose and avoid, namely, to choose virtues and avoid vices and the activities to which they lead.</p></div>



<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="229"><p>  Further, who could be more truly called benefactors 



than parents in relation to their children? First, they have brought them out of non-existence;
<note n="7.449.b">Or “brought them out of non-existence into existence.” See note 3. As the words stand in the text they should mean “made them to be non-existent,” for ἐργάζομαι does not appear to be used absolutely = “create.” the other hand, ἐργάζεσθαί τινά τι = “to render a person something” (adjective) is a known construction used by Philo, <hi rend="italic">e.g. De Agr.</hi> 58 τὸν λαὸν . . . φιλήδονον . . . ἐργάσηται, <hi rend="italic">cf. Quod Deus</hi> 43, <hi rend="italic">De Sac.</hi> 48. If corrected as suggested, the phrase “made non-existent persons existent” is quite parallel to τὰ μὴ ὄντα εἰς τὸ εἶναι παρήγαγον in § 225 and elsewhere.</note>
  then, again, they have held them entitled to nurture and later to education of body and soul, so that they may have not only life, but a good life.</p></div>



<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="230"><p> They have 





<pb n="451"/>





benefited the body by means of the gymnasium and the training there given, through which it gains muscular vigour and good condition and the power to bear itself and move with an ease marked by gracefulness and elegance. They have done the same for the soul by means of letters
<note n="7.451.a">Including the lower instruction in reading and writing and the higher in literature, called respectively γραμματιστική and γραμματική, <hi rend="italic">De Cong.</hi> 148.</note>
  and arithmetic and geometry and music and philosophy as a whole which lifts on high the mind lodged within the mortal body and escorts it to the very heaven and shews it the blessed and happy beings that dwell therein, and creates in it an eager longing for the unswerving ever-harmonious order which they never forsake because they obey their captain and marshal.  </p></div>



<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="231"><p> But in addition to the benefits they confer, parents have also received authority over their offspring. That authority is not obtained by lot nor voting as it is in the cities, where it may be alleged that the lot is due to a blunder of fortune in which reason has no place, and the voting to the impetuosity of the mob, always so reckless and devoid of circumspection, but is awarded by the most admirable and perfect judgement of nature above us which governs with justice things both human and divine.
</p></div>



<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="232"><p> 
<milestone unit="altchapter" n="41"/> And therefore fathers have the right to upbraid their children and admonish them severely and if they do not submit to threats conveyed in words to beat and degrade them
<note n="7.451.b">i.e. perhaps by setting them to degrading tasks. Heinemann aptly quotes Plato, <hi rend="italic">Laws</hi> 866 E προπηλακισθέντες λόγοις ἢ καὶ ἀτίμοις ἔργοις.</note>
  and put them in bonds. And further if in the face of this they continue to rebel, and carried away by their incorrigible depravity refuse the yoke, the law permits the parents to extend the punishment to death, though here it requires more than the father alone or





<pb n="453"/>





the mother alone.
<note n="7.453.a">See Deut. xxi. 18–21. Philo’s language suggests a more independent action on the part of the parents than Deuteronomy. See App. p. 629.</note>
  So great a penalty should be the sentence, not only of one of them but of both. For it is not to be expected that both the parents would agree to the execution of their son unless the weight of his offences depressed the scale strongly enough to overcome the affection which nature has firmly established in them.</p></div>



<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="233"><p>  But parents have 



not only been given the right of exercising authority over their children, but the power of a master corresponding to the two primary
<note n="7.453.b">See on § 82.</note>
  forms under which servants are owned, one when they are home-bred, the other when they are purchased. For parents pay out a sum many times the value of a slave on their children and for them to nurses, tutors and teachers, apart from the cost of their clothes, food and superintendence in sickness and health from their earliest years until they are full grown. “Homebred” too must they be who are not only born in the house but through the masters of the house, who have made the contribution enforced by the statutes of nature in giving them birth.

all these facts before them, they do not do anything deserving of praise who honour their parents, since any one of the considerations mentioned is in itself quite a sufficient call to shew reverence. And on the contrary, they deserve blame and obloquy and extreme punishment who do not respect them as seniors nor listen to them as instructors nor feel the duty of requiting them as benefactors nor obey them as rulers nor fear them as masters.</p></div>



<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="235"><p> Honour therefore,

who are crowned with a laurel of the second rank assigned to them by nature, the arbitress of the contest.

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="236"><p> For 



parents have little thought for their own personal interests and find the consummation of happiness in the high excellence of their children, and to gain this the children will be willing to hearken to their commands and to obey them in everything that is just and profitable; for the true father will give no instruction to his son that is foreign to virtue.

</p></div>



<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="237"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="43"/> But the proof of filial piety may be given 



not only in the ways above mentioned, but also by courtesy shewn to persons who share the seniority of the parents. One who pays respect to an aged man or woman who is not of his kin may be regarded as having remembrance of his father and mother. He looks to them as prototypes and stands in awe of those who bear their image.</p></div>



<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="238"><p> And therefore in the 



Holy Scriptures the young are commanded not only to yield the chief seats to the aged but also to give place to them as they pass,
<note n="7.455.a">See Lev. xix. 32, “Thou shalt rise up before the hoary head, and honour the face of the old man.” The LXX has ἀπὸ προσώπου πολιοῦ ἐξαναστήσῃ, which Philo might easily take to mean “rise up away from,” i.e. make room for him.

<note n="7.455.b">See Lev. xix. 3.</note>
 



<pb n="457"/>





Here he sets fear before affection, not as better in every way, but as more serviceable and profitable for the occasion which he has before him. For in the first place, persons subject to instruction and admonition are in fact wanting in sense, and want of sense is only cured by fear. Secondly, it would not be suitable to include in the enactments of a lawgiver an instruction on the duty of filial affection, for nature has implanted this as an imperative instinct from the very cradle in the souls of those who are thus united by kinship.</p></div>



<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="240"><p>
<note n="7.457.a">See App. p. 629.</note>
  And therefore he omitted any mention 



of love for parents because it is learned and taught by instinct and requires no injunction, but did enjoin fear for the sake of those who are in the habit of neglecting their duty. For when parents cherish their children with extreme tenderness, providing them with good gifts from every quarter and shunning no toil or danger because they are fast bound to them by the magnetic forces of affection, there are some who do not receive this exceeding tenderheartedness in a way that profits them. They pursue eagerly luxury and voluptuousness, they applaud the dissolute life, they run to waste both in body and soul, and suffer no part of either to be kept erect by its proper faculties which they lay prostrate and paralyzed without a blush because they have never feared the censors they possess in their fathers and mothers but give in to and indulge their own lusts.</p></div>



<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="241"><p> But these 



parents also must be exhorted to employ more active and severe admonitions to cure the wastage of their children, and the children also that they may stand

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="242"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="44"/> I have now discussed the five heads of the 



laws belonging to the first table, and all the particular enactments which may be classed under each of the five. But I must also state the penalties decreed for transgression of them.</p></div>



<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="243"><p> The result of 



the close affinity which the offences have to each other is that they all have a common punishment, namely, death, but there are different reasons for this punishment. We should begin with the last commandment, on the behaviour due to parents, since our discussion of it is fresh in our minds. He says “if anyone strikes his father or mother, let him be stoned.”
<note n="7.459.a">See Ex. xxi. 15, “Let him be surely put to death” (LXX θανάτῳ θανατούσθω). Philo quotes it in <hi rend="italic">De Fuga</hi> 83 with τελευτάτω. As stoning is the common form of execution in the Pentateuch and is definitely mentioned as the method to be used in the case of the disobedient son, the discrepancy is not remarkable.</note>
  This is quite just, for justice forbids that he should live who maltreats the authors of his life.</p></div>



<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="244"><p> But some dignitaries and legislators who had 



an eye to men’s opinions rather than to truth, have decreed that striking a father should be punished by cutting off the hands, a specious refinement
<note n="7.459.b">The common meaning of κομψεύω as applied to clever or subtle words and actions (Heinemann, “in spitzfindiger Weise”), <hi rend="italic">cf. De Mig.</hi> 75, does not fit in well with the next words, which represent the practice as a concession to the thoughtless. The feeling expressed in it may be either that the officials disguise their real feelings or that the course adopted is less coarse and drastic than capital punishment, or perhaps a combination of both these.</note>
  due to their wish to win the approval of the more careless or thoughtless, who think that the parts with which the offenders have struck their parents should be amputated.</p></div>



<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="245"><p>
<note n="7.459.c">On the evidence for the existence of this law see App. pp. 629–630.</note>
  But it is silly to visit displeasure on the 



servants rather than on the actual authors, for the







<pb n="461"/>





outrage is not committed by the hands but by the persons who used their hands to commit it, and it is these persons who must be punished. Otherwise, when one man has killed another with a sword, we should cast the sword out of the land and let the murderer go free, and conversely, honour should be given, not to those who have distinguished themselves in war, but to the lifeless equipments and weapons which were the instruments of their exploits.</p></div>



<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="246"><p> In the case of the victors in the athletic contests, 



whether at the single or the double course or the long race or the boxing or the general contest, will they try to garland the legs and hands only and disregard the bodies of the athletes as a whole? It would surely be ridiculous to introduce such practices and give to the indispensable accompaniments the punishments or honours which should be given to the responsible persons. For similarly, in musical exhibitions, when anyone makes a highly successful performance on the flute or lyre, we do not pass him by and adjudge the laudatory announcements and honours to the instruments.</p></div>



<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="247"><p> Why then, you 



grand legislators, should we cut off the hands of those who strike a father? Or is your object that the offenders, besides being quite useless, may levy a tribute not annually, but daily, on those whom they have wronged, because they are unable to provide the sustenance they need. For no father is so iron-hearted as to allow his son to starve to death, particularly as his anger grows faint as time goes on.</p></div>



<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="248"><p> And even if while making no assault with his hands 



he uses abusive language to those to whom good words are owed as a bounden duty, or in any other way does anything to dishonour his parents, let him die.

<note n="7.463.f">Heinemann, ignoring οὐχί, translates “one of the obscure and little esteemed,” and adds in a note that Philo has inferred his insignificance either from his collecting firewood, or from the absence of any mention of his name. If this is not mere inadvertence, he must have considered that οὐχί should be expunged. But his explanations of the man’s insignificance are very unconvincing, and, as the A of Philo do not shew as much tendency to insert negatives as they do to omit them, the text may stand, though I know of no explanation of Philo’s statement that the offender was of high rank.</note>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="252"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="46"/> For persons who call God to witness to an 



untruth, death is the appointed punishment,
<note n="7.465.d">Philo has no scriptural authority for death as a punishment for breaking the third commandment, which he here confines to perjury, and indeed this was recognized in § 27.

<note n="7.465.e">Not, I think, “lightly,” “thoughtlessly,” as Heinemann (“leichtfertig”). The sense of “falsely” is not uncommon in classical Greek.

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="254"><p> Yet none is so foolish

<note n="7.467.a">Philo seems to take as his authority for the death sentence on the breach of the first commandment Deut. xvii. 2–5, where the false gods are described in much the same way as here, and on breaches of the second Ps. cxv. 8, where instead of the A.V. “they that make them are like unto them” the LXX has ὅμοιοι γένοιντο, “may they become like.”</note>

both body and soul are benefited in two most essential ways. The body is benefited by the recurrence of respite from continuous and wearisome toil, the soul by the excellent conceptions which it receives of God as the world-maker and guardian of what He has begotten. For He brought all things to their completion on the seventh day. These things shew clearly that he who gives due value

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="261"><p> So too indeed he who 



shews respect to his parents should not seek anything further, for if he look he will find his guerdon in the action itself. However, since this commandment, inasmuch as it is concerned with mortal things, is inferior to the first four heads whose province is nearer the divine, He gave encouragement with the words, “Honour thy father and thy mother, that it may be well with thee and that thy time may be long.”</p></div>



<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="262"><p> Here He names two rewards: one is the possession

forth Himself without a spokesman or interpreter, we have spoken of five, namely those graven on the first table, and also of all the particular laws which had reference to these, and our present duty is to couple with them those of the second table as well as we can, I will again endeavour to fit the special laws into each of the heads.</p></div>



<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="8"><p> The first
<note n="7.479.a">So LXX in Ex. xx., though not in Deut. v. Cf. <hi rend="italic">De Dec.</hi> 121.</note>
  commandment in 



the second table is “Thou shalt not commit adultery.” It comes first, I think, because pleasure is a mighty force felt throughout the whole inhabited world, no part of which has escaped its domination, neither the denizens of land nor of sea nor of the air, for in all three elements beasts, fowls and fishes all alike treat her with profound respect and deference and submit to her orders, look to her every glance or nod, accept contentedly even the caprices of her arrogance and almost anticipate her commands, so promptly and instantaneously do they hasten to render their services.</p></div>



<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="9"><p> Now even natural pleasure is often greatly 



to blame when the craving for it is immoderate and insatiable, as for instance when it takes the form of voracious gluttony, even though none of the food taken is of the forbidden kind, or again the passionate desire for women shewn by those who in their craze for sexual intercourse behave unchastely, not with the wives of others, but with their own.</p></div>



<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="10"><p> But the 



blame in most of these cases rests less with the soul





<pb n="481"/>





than with the body, which contains a great amount both of fire and of moisture; the fire as it consumes the material set before it quickly demands a second supply; the moisture is sluiced in a stream through the genital organs, and creates in them irritations, itchings and titillations without ceasing.</p></div>



<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="11"><p> It is not so with men who are mad to possess the 



wives of others, sometimes those of their relations and friends, who live to work havoc among their neighbours, who go about to bastardize wholesale widespread family connexions, to turn their prayers for married happiness into a curse and render their hopes of offspring fruitless. Here it is the soul which is incurably diseased. Such persons must be punished with death

Cohn’s insertion of μητρυιῶν is indefensible, as clearly it is mothers rather than stepmothers who are primarily under consideration. But no insertion is required, αἶς . . . συνέρχεσθαι is a natural way of describing unions which, though not adulterous, are incestuous.</note>

<note n="7.489.a">See App. p. 633.</note>

Why hamper the fellow-feeling and inter-communion of men with men by compressing within the narrow space of each separate house the great and goodly plant which might extend and spread itself over continents and islands and the whole inhabited world? For intermarriages with outsiders create new kinships not a wit inferior to blood-relationships.

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="26"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="5"/> On this principle 



he prohibits many other unions,
<note n="7.489.c">All these degrees of relationship are mentioned in Lev. xviii 10–16, except that there the prohibition against marriage with the paternal uncle’s wife does not seem to be extended, as here implied, to the maternal uncle’s wife. In the parallel passage, xx. 20, the R.V. has “uncle’s wife” simply, but Philo would read in the LXX τῆς συγγενοῦς αὐτοῦ.</note>
  not allowing marriage with a son’s daughter or a daughter’s daughter, nor with an aunt whether paternal or maternal, nor with one who has been wife to an uncle or son or brother, nor again with a stepdaughter whether

widow or unmarried, I need not say while the wife is alive, heaven forbid, but even after her death. For the stepfather is virtually a father whose duty is to set his wife’s daughter in the same position as his own.</p></div>



<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="27"><p> Again, he does not allow the same man to 



marry two sisters either at the same or at different times, even if the person in question has repudiated the one he married first.
<note n="7.491.a">In these two sections Philo follows closely Lev. xviii. 18, “thou shalt not take a woman to her sister to be a rival to her, to uncover her nakedness beside the other in her lifetime.” The LXX for “rival,” ἀντίζηλος, suggests even better than the R.V. the idea of jealousy which Philo stresses. Nothing is said in Leviticus of the deceased wife’s sister, nor by Philo, though his argument suggests that he would not object to it He also says nothing about marriage with a brother’s wife, though that is forbidden in <hi rend="italic">v.</hi> 16. Possibly he did not see how to reconcile it with the express injunction of such a marriage, “to raise up seed to the brother,” in Deut. xxv. 5 ff.</note>
  For while she is still alive either as his consort or divorced,
<note n="7.491.b">If εἰ is read for εἴτε (see note 1), the meaning will be “while his (former) partner is alive, even though she has been divorced.” This certainly best suits the rest of the sentence, which is confined to the case of the divorced wife. On the other hand it strains the meaning of the present participle τῆς συνοικούσης and leaves out of consideration τῷ αὐτῷ χρόνῳ above, which clearly contemplates the possibility of bigamy.</note>
  whether she is remaining in widowhood or has married another, he considered that the law of holiness required that the sister should not take the position which the wife has lost by her misfortune, but should learn not to set at nought the rights of kinship, nor use as a stepping-stone the fallen state of one so closely united to her by birth, nor bask at ease while enjoying and returning the caresses of her sister’s enemies.</p></div>



<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="28"><p> For from this source grow grave jealousies and bitter

Sisters though made as separate parts of the system are fitted into it and formed into a single whole by nature and identity of parentage.

<note n="7.493.a">Ex. xxxiv. 16, Deut. vii. 3 (here, as also in §§ 30, 31, Philo digresses from his interpretation of the prohibitions in Lev. xviii.). Though the prohibition in both Exodus and Deuteronomy is against intermarriage with the conquered Canaanites, the motive assigned, viz. fear of contamination with heathenism, is naturally regarded as making it a general ordinance. Josephus also appeals to it in condemnation of Solomon, <hi rend="italic">Ant.</hi> viii. 191.</note>
 But also, he says, 



do not enter into the partnership of marriage with a member of a foreign nation, lest some day conquered by the forces of opposing customs you surrender and stray unawares from the path that leads to piety and turn aside into a pathless wild. And though perhaps you yourself will hold your ground steadied from your earliest years by the admirable instructions instilled into you by your parents, with the holy laws always as their key-note, there is much to be feared for your sons and daughters. It may well be that they, enticed by spurious customs which they prefer to the genuine, are likely to unlearn the honour due to the one God, and that is the first and the last stage of supreme misery.

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="30"><p><milestone unit="para"/>Another commandment is that if a woman after

<note n="7.493.b">Deut. xxiv. 4, where such an act is described as an abomination before the Lord, and defiling (LXX) the land. Though no penalty is mentioned, Philo, perhaps not unreasonably, interprets these strong phrases as describing an act deserving the death penalty, but is hard put to justify it. Apparently he understands the text as meaning that the remarriage shews that there was no real reason for the divorce. The woman is therefore “defiled” and an adulteress, and he not only a “pander,” but an adulterer, either because he has connived at her adultery or perhaps because to marry an adulteress is in itself adultery. See further, App. p. 633.</note>
  And if a man is willing to

He has eliminated from his soul the hatred of evil, that emotion by which our life is so well served and the affairs of houses and cities are conducted as they should be, and has lightly taken upon him the stamp of two heinous crimes, adultery and pandering.

He omits vv. 20, 21, the first denouncing simple adultery, already dealt with, the second against offering children to Moloch, which has no connexion with his present subject, even if he understood it, which is hardly possible, as the LXX has “give thy seed to serve the ruler.”</note>
  He must also remember the lesson that the generative seeds should not be wasted fruitlessly for the sake of a gross and untimely pleasure.

  These likewise, I consider, refer symbolically to the quest for the truth.

 Some consider that midway between the corruption 



of a maiden and adultery stands the crime committed on the eve of marriage,
<note n="7.519.d">The curious word ὑπογάμιον occurs only here. The suggestion in the translation is that it is formed on the analogy of the not uncommon use of ὑπό = “just before.” But except for the epic adjectives ὑπηοῖος and ὑποδείελος, I cannot find any analogous compounds. However, ὑπὸ γόμον would be an easy correction. The general opinion seems to be that the ὑπό suggests “secret” or “illicit,” and presumably this is the idea in Mangey’s “interceptus concubitus,” and L.&amp; S.’s “illicit intercourse with a betrothed person.” Also the word seems to be regularly regarded as a substantive. It seems to me more likely that it is an adjective agreeing with ἀδίκημα.</note>
  when mutual agreements have affianced the parties beyond all doubt, but before the marriage was celebrated, another man, either by seduction or violence, has intercourse with the bride. But this too, to my thinking, is a form of adultery. For the agreements, being documents containing the names of the man and woman, and the other particulars





<pb n="521"/>





needed for wedlock, are equivalent to marriage.</p></div>



<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="73"><p>
<note n="7.521.a">Deuteronomy makes no suggestion of a documentary form of betrothal, though it speaks of a “bill of divorcement” (xxiv. 3). But Philo naturally reads into it the practice of his own time. See App. pp. 634–635.</note>
  And therefore the law ordains that both should 



be stoned to death, if, that is, they set about their misdeeds by mutual agreement with one and the same purpose. For if they were not actuated by the same purpose, they cannot be regarded as fellow-criminals, where there was no such fellowship.</p></div>



<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="74"><p> Thus we find that difference of situation makes the 



criminality greater or less. Naturally it is greater if the act is committed in the city and less if it is committed outside the walls and in a solitude. For here there is no one to help the girl, though she says and does everything possible to keep her virginity intact and invulnerable, while in the town there are council-chambers and law-courts, crowds of controllers of districts,
<note n="7.521.b">Or “nomes.” See on i. 55.</note>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="75"><p> For 



assuredly there is in the soul of every man, however undistinguished he may be, a detestation of evil, and if this emotion is roused, no outside influence is then needed to turn its possessor into a champion ready to do battle for anyone who to all appearance has been wronged.

</p></div>



<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="76"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="13"/> As for the man who perpetrated the 



violation, justice pursues him everywhere, and difference of situation lends him no help to make good his outrageous and lawless conduct. It is not so with the girl. In the one case pity and forgiveness attend her, as I have said, in the other inexorable punishment.</p></div>



<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="77"><p> And indeed her position demands careful 



inquiry from the judge who must not make everything turn upon the scene of the act. For she may have been forced against her will in the heart of the





<pb n="523"/>





city, and she may have surrendered voluntarily to unlawful embraces outside the city. And therefore the law in defending the case of a woman deflowered in a solitude is careful to add the very excellent proviso: “The damsel cried out and there was none to help her;” so that if she neither cried out nor resisted but co-operated willingly, she will be found guilty, and her use of the place as an excuse is merely a device to make it seem that she was forced.</p></div>



<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="78"><p> Again what help would be available in the city to one 



who was willing to use all possible means to protect her personal honour, but was unable to do so because of the strength which the ravisher could bring to bear? If he should bind her with the help of others
<note n="7.523.a">Lit. “the others,” i.e. those others whose help would be required to bind and gag her before she could cry out. Perhaps, however, τῶν ἄλλων is neuter, i.e. “besides the rest of his violence”; translate, “if he further proceeds to bind her.” Cohn, who originally suggested the correction mentioned in note 1, came to the conclusion (<hi rend="italic">Hermes</hi>, 1908, p. 205) that this solution was satisfactory. He compares <hi rend="italic">De Dec.</hi> 69.</note>

In a sense such a one, though living in a city, is in a solitude, being solitary so far as helpers are concerned. The other, even if no one was present to help, may be said, in view of her willing cooperation, to be in exactly the same position as the offender in the town.

This is perhaps because the real subject of these sections is the misconduct of husbands who make treacherous attempts to get rid of unwanted wives. Still, the omission is curious. Apart from the concealment, the misconduct of the woman is not, or need not be, ὑπογάμιον, and falls under the head of φθορά, which Philo has treated as an ἀτύχημα to the maiden rather than a crime (§ 70).

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="81"><p> For the danger affects 



not only the daughters whose bodily chastity is impugned, but also their guardians, against whom the charge is brought not only that they failed to watch over them at the most critical period of adolescence, but that the brides they had given as virgins had been dishonoured by other men, and thereby the bride-grooms

flee to some of the cities allotted to this tribe, there to gain consolation and be saved from despairing of salvation altogether. There the place will remind him of the fearless courage once shewn in the past; there he may reflect that those who shed blood intentionally received not only full pardon but also rewards great and much to be desired and fraught with abundant happiness; and that, if they fared thus, much more will those whose act was not premeditated receive, not indeed such privileges as confer honour, but at least the lowest and last that they do not pay for the blood they have shed with their own. This shews that not every kind of homicide is culpable but only that which entails injustice, and that as for the other kinds if it is caused by an ardent yearning for virtue it is laudable and if unintentional it is free from blame.</p></div>



<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="129"><p>  No 



more need be said about the first reason; we must proceed at once to explain the second.
<note n="7.557.a">The first reason for the choice of the Levitical cities was that their history shewed that homicide was not necessarily a crime. The second was that their superior sanctity made them a more secure refuge.</note>
  The law wishes to preserve the unintentional homicide, as it recognizes that in intention he was free from guilt, and that with his hands he had been the servant of justice, the overseer of human affairs. It knows that watching and waiting for him are blood-thirsty enemies, the kinsmen of the dead man, urged on to vengeance by overwhelming pity and inconsolable



<pb n="559"/>





grief, and so carried away by unreasoning passion that they do not inquire what is true or essentially just.</p></div>



<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="130"><p> It therefore permitted such a one to fly for refuge, 



not to the holy temple, since he had not yet been purged, nor yet to some obscure and insignificant place where he might easily be surrendered as one of little account, but to a holy city which comes midway between holy and profane ground and is in a sense a secondary temple. For the cities of the consecrated order compared with the others receive a higher reverence, corresponding, I consider, to the honour paid to their respective occupants. The law wished in fact to use the superior rank of the city which gave them shelter to put the safety of the fugitive on the firmest possible footing.</p></div>



<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="131"><p>
<note n="7.559.a">Philo’s explanations in §§ 131–136 of “till the death of the high priest” are (1) that the high priest, as representing the nation, is bound to inflict the punishment which the fugitive incurs by leaving his refuge; (2) that he is a theoretically perfect character and will therefore refuse to tolerate the presence of even the involuntary offender. In the first case the φυγή is regarded as a refuge, in the second as exile (as in § 123). See further App. p. 638.</note>
 When, as 



I said, it appointed the death of the high priest as the date for the exile’s return, it did so for some such reason as this. Just as each single individual who is wilfully murdered has kinsmen to inflict vengeance on the murderer, so too the whole nation has a kinsman and close relative common to all in the high priest, who as ruler dispenses justice to litigants according to the law, who day by day offers prayers and sacrifices and asks for blessings, as for his brothers and parents and children, that every age and every part of the nation regarded as a single body may be united in one and the same fellowship, making peace and good order their aim.</p></div>



<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="132"><p> Everyone, then, who has slain another 



unintentionally must fear the high priest as a champion and defender of the slain and keep himself





<pb n="561"/>





shut up within the city in which he has taken refuge, never venturing to shew himself outside the walls, that is, if he sets any value on his safety, or on a life secure from danger.</p></div>



<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="133"><p> When, then, he says that the

  For laymen it may be allowed that it is enough to keep undefiled from voluntary misdeeds only, and anyone who likes may say the same of the other priests, but he must make an exception of the high priest and agree that he needs to be innocent of the involuntary as well as the voluntary. </p></div>

For these are signs of no peaceful spirit, but of one so intemperate as to seek to throw off all responsibility and take the tyrant’s despotism for its model.</p></div>

of evil, the defender and champion of the ill-used, who will call upon him to give an account for the unhappy condition of the sufferers.</p></div>



<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="141"><p>
<note n="7.565.a">The thought of justice as the adversary and the legal process described in the next section probably spring from a misunderstanding of Ex. xxi. 20. There, where the E.V. has “he shall surely be punished,” the LXX has δίκῃ ἐκδικηθήσεται. Philo, misunderstanding, as often, the Hebrew idiomatic way of strengthening the verb, takes this to mean “he shall be condemned by justice.” He also interprets this to imply the death-penalty, though the text points rather to a fine (see Driver, <hi rend="italic">ad loc.</hi>).</note>
  And if he 



alleges that the stripes he inflicted were meant as a deterrent and not with the intention of causing death, he shall not at once depart with a cheerful heart, but will be brought before the court, there to be examined under strict investigators of the truth as to whether he meant to commit homicide or not; and if he is found to have acted with intentional wickedness and with malice aforethought he must die, and his position as master will avail him nothing to escape the sentence.</p></div>



<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="142"><p>
<note n="7.565.b">Ex. xxi. 21, “Notwithstanding if he continue (LXX διαβιώσῃ, “survive”) a day or two, he shall not be punished; for he is his money.” Philo understands the first part of this to mean that the master will be acquitted on the grounds that if he had intended to kill the slave he would have done so at once. The last words, “for he is his money,” which probably mean that the master will not be fined, as he anyhow loses his property, are construed as a plea that he cannot have intended to destroy a valuable possession. Philo fails to observe that the plea would have been equally applicable if the slave had died on the spot.</note>
 But if the 



sufferers do not die on the spot under the lash but survive for one or perhaps two days, the situation is different and the master is not to be held guilty of murder. In this case he is provided with a valuable plea, namely that he did not beat them to death at the time nor yet later when he had them in his house, but suffered them to live as long as they could, even though that was quite a short time. Furthermore he may argue that no one is so foolish as to try to harm another when he himself will be wronged thereby.</p></div>



<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="143"><p> And it is true that anyone who kills a slave 



injures himself far more, as he deprives himself of





<pb n="567"/>





the service which he receives from him when alive and loses his value as a piece of property, which may be possibly very considerable. When the slave has committed some act worthy of death his master should bring him before the judges and state the offence, thus leaving the decision of the penalty with the laws instead of keeping it in his own hands.

 If a bull gores a man and kills him, it must 



be stoned,
<note n="7.567.b">The stoning is probably to avoid contact, cf. Ex. xix. 13, “no hand shall touch him but he shall surely be stoned or shot through “(with a dart). Philo seems to understand it that any animal killed in the ordinary way is suitable for sacrifice.</note>
  since it is not fit to be slaughtered as a sacrifice, and its flesh must not be eaten. Why is this? It is required by the law of holiness that the flesh of an animal that has killed a man should not be used as a foodstuff for men or to make their food more palatable.</p></div>



<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="145"><p> If the owner of the animal knowing

  or if he has had information from others that it is unmanageable, he must be held guilty as responsible for the death by allowing it to range at large.

like,
<note n="7.569.a">Ex. xxi. 36, “pay bull for bull.” Philo, I think, rightly interprets this to pay compensation enough to buy another bull (or whatever the animal killed is), not as Goodenough, to hand over his own (and vicious) bull to the other. The words expunged by Cohn (see note 1), “because having foreknowledge of the savageness of his own animal he has not taken precautions; and if it kills the beast of another, he must pay the like as compensation,” are absurdly superfluous.

In the second of these verses, where the E.V. has “ye shall take no ransom for him that is fled to his city of refuge, that he should come again to dwell in the land until the death of the priest,” the LXX has οὐ λήψεσθε λύτρα τοῦ φυγεῖν εἰς πόλιν κτλ., which might easily be wrongly taken to mean “ye shall not accept a ransom so that he shall fly.” Philo’s phrase in “substitute banishment for death” suggests that he did take it so, meaning presumably that the voluntary homicide might purchase a leave to use the city of refuge.</note>
 The law forbids the acceptance of 



ransom-money from a murderer deserving of death, in order to mitigate his punishment or substitute banishment for death, for blood is purged with blood,

Probably he understood that it is only the corpse of the malefactor which is so affixed, though he does not make it absolutely clear.</note>
  Yet 



after giving this injunction he hastened to revert to his natural humanity and shews mercy to those whose deeds were merciless when he says “Let not the sun go down upon the crucified but let them be buried in the earth before sundown.”
<note n="7.571.d">Deut. xxi. 22, 23. Philo treats the text very freely. It does not enjoin the “hanging,” but merely that if it is done, the body shall be buried the same day. Nor is it specified that it is a punishment for murderers in particular.</note>
  For while it was necessary that the enemies of every part of the universe should after punishment be set on high and

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="154"><p> These last in their excessive and over-whelming

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="155"><p> To these we should answer 



“your devotion is mistimed and the mistimed deserves censure just as the rightly timed deserves praise. It is right indeed to shew friendship to those whose actions are worthy of friendship, but no evil-doer is a true friend. Those whom we call our kinsfolk or within the circle of kinsmen our friends are turned into aliens by their misconduct when they go astray; for agreement to practise justice and every virtue makes a closer kinship than that of blood, and he who abandons this enters his name in the list not only of strangers and foreigners but of mortal enemies.</p></div>



<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="156"><p> Why,

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="159"><p>  An 



example of this was given a little time ago in our own district by a person who was appointed to serve as a collector of taxes. When some of his debtors whose default was clearly due to poverty took flight in fear of the fatal consequences of his vengeance, he carried off by force their womenfolk and children and parents and their other relatives and beat and subjected them to every kind of outrage and contumely in order to make them either tell him the whereabouts of the fugitive or discharge his debt themselves. As they could do neither the first for want of knowledge, nor the second because they were as penniless as the fugitive, he continued this treatment until while

wringing their bodies with racks and instruments of torture he finally dispatched them by newly-invented methods of execution.</p></div>



<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="160"><p> He filled a large

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="161"><p> Some of 



these, whose souls saw facts more vividly than did their eyes, feeling themselves maltreated in the bodies of others, hastened to take leave of their lives with the aid of sword or poison or halter, thinking that in their evil plight it was a great piece of luck to die without suffering torture.</p></div>



<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="162"><p> The others 



who had not seized the opportunity to dispatch themselves were brought out in a row, as is done in the awarding of inheritances, first those who stood in the first degrees of kinship, after them the second, then the third and so on till the last.</p></div>



<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="163"><p> And when there were no kinsmen left, the maltreatment was passed on to their neighbours and sometimes even to villages and cities which quickly became desolate and stripped of their inhabitants who left their homes and dispersed to places where they expected to remain unobserved.Yet perhaps it is not to be wondered at

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="165"><p> If they were companions in

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="166"><p> Probably you, most reverend

and observing the errors current among other nations regarded them with aversion as ruinous to the ideal commonwealth; persons whose conduct shewed any kind of sloth or inhumanity or vice he detested and would not ever surrender anyone whose life had been passed in their company to be punished with them and thus made an appendix to the crimes of others.</p></div>



<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="168"><p> He therefore expressly forbade that sons 



should be slain instead of fathers or fathers instead of sons. Thereby also he gave it as his judgement that persons who had sinned should be the persons who were punished, whether the punishment consisted of monetary fines or stripes and injurious treatment of a still more violent kind, or wounds and maiming and disfranchisement and exile or any other kind of sentence.

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="173"><p> If indeed

In § 178 of the literal explanation he merely says that is what is commonly given, not that it is true, and his preference for the allegorical is not disguised.</note>

widely stated, but I have heard another from highly gifted men who think that most of the contents of the law-book are outward symbols of hidden truths, expressing in words what has been left unsaid. This explanation was as follows.
<note n="7.587.b">The text is allegorized in substantially the same way in <hi rend="italic">De Som</hi>. ii. 68, 69, though the point of the “female soul” is not there brought out.</note>
  There is in the soul a male and female element just as there is in families, the male corresponding to the men, the female to the women. The male soul assigns itself to God alone as the Father and Maker of the Universe and the Cause of all things. The female clings to all that is born and perishes; it stretches out its faculties like a hand to catch blindly at what comes in its way, and gives the clasp of friendship to the world of created things with all its numberless changes and transmutations, instead of to the divine order, the immutable, the

blessed, the thrice happy.</p></div>



<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="179"><p> Naturally therefore we

  not meaning that the body should be mutilated by the loss of a most essential member, but to bid us exscind from the soul the godless thoughts which take for their basis all that comes into being through birth; for the “pair” are a symbol of seed-sowing and birth.</p></div>



<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="180"><p> I will add 



another thought, following where the study of nature leads me.
<note n="7.589.b">Heinemann “in natürlichem Zusammenhang.” I hardly think φύσεως can bear this meaning. I understand it of the higher truths of nature, which the allegorist (ὁ φυσικός) contemplates. See note on <hi rend="italic">De Abr</hi>. 99, and the references there given.</note>
  The monad is the image of the first cause, the dyad of matter passive and divisible. Therefore one who honours the dyad before the monad should not fail to know that he holds matter in higher esteem than God. It is for this reason that the law judged it right to cut off this tendency of the soul as if it were a hand, for there is no greater impiety than to ascribe to the passive element the power of the active principle.

for the services and benefits which the eyes render to the human race, it would take a long time to enumerate them, but one, the best, must be mentioned.

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="189"><p> The mind, having 



discerned through the faculty of sight what of itself it was not able to apprehend, did not simply stop short at what it saw, but, drawn by its love of knowledge and beauty and charmed by the marvellous spectacle, came to the reasonable conclusion that all these were not brought together automatically by unreasoning forces, but by the mind of God Who is rightly called their Father and Maker; also that they are not unlimited but are bounded by the ambit of a single universe, walled in like a city by the outermost sphere of the fixed stars; also that the Father Who begat them according to the law of nature takes thought for His offspring, His providence watching over both the whole and the parts.</p></div>



<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="190"><p> Then it went on to inquire 



what is the substance of the world which we see and whether its constituents are all the same in substance or do some differ from others; what are the elements of which each particular part is composed, what are the causes which brought them into being, and what are the forces or properties which hold them together and are these forces corporeal or incorporeal.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="192"><p> This is the greatest boon which sight bestowed on

if the master is mutilated as a punishment the injured slave will find him worse than before.

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="196"><p> The law, therefore, provided

The servant will receive a double solatium for his suffering; he is not only set at liberty but has escaped from a harsh and cruel master.

strikes out a servant’s tooth he must grant him his liberty.
<note n="7.599.a">Ex. xxi. 27.</note>
  Why is this? Because life is precious and the means contrived by nature for the preservation of life are teeth by which the food is subjected to the processes necessary for dealing with it. Now the teeth are divided into the cutters and the grinders; the former do their part by cutting or biting the bread-stuffs and all other comestibles, whence their appropriate name of cutters, the latter by their





<pb n="601"/>





capacity for reducing the bitten pieces into smaller particles.</p></div>



<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="199"><p>  This is the reason why the 



Maker and Father, Whose way is to frame nothing that does not serve some purpose, did not make the teeth straight away at birth like each of the other parts. He bore in mind that they would be a superfluous burden to the infant who would be fed on milk, and would also bring serious trouble to the breasts, the fountain through which the liquid sustenance flows, as they would be galled during the suction of the milk.</p></div>



<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="200"><p> He 



looked forward, therefore, to the proper time, that is, to when the infant is weaned from the breast, and brought out that supplementary growth of teeth, which He hitherto kept in storage, only when the infant would refuse to take food in the form of milk and could bear the more mature kind which requires the instruments which I have mentioned.

</p></div>



<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="201"><p><milestone unit="para"/>If, then, anyone gives way to insolent presumption 



and strikes out his servant’s tooth which ministers obediently to his most essential needs, sustenance and survival, he must set at liberty the victim of his injustice and suffer himself the loss of the services and ministries of the injured party.

  Is a tooth then, I shall be asked, of the same value as an eye?</p></div>



<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="202"><p> They 



are both, I should reply, of the same value for the purposes for which they were made, the eye being made for what is visible, the tooth for what is edible.

<pb n="603"/>





of what is most useful for maintaining life, namely food. Also anyone who has lost his sight is not thereby prevented from living, but one who has had his teeth struck out has only a most miserable death awaiting him.</p></div>



<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="203"><p> So if anyone takes steps to injure his 



servants in this part of their bodies he must recognize that the effect of his act upon them is a famine artificially created in the midst of abundance and plenty.

defiance of the law.
<note n="8.9.a">Philo could hardly have justified this from Ex. xxii., unless perhaps he argues that the permission to kill the housebreaker shows that the law took a severer view of violence. For analogies in Roman and other law see App. p. 425.</note>
  But if he does it secretly and tries to avoid observation like a thief, since his ashamedness serves to palliate his misdeeds,
<note n="8.9.b">This I think must be the meaning, though it gives the phrase a somewhat different sense from what it bears in § 7. Heinemann has merely “veils his crime in shame”; Goodenough “making a veil of shame for his sin.”</note>
  he must be punished in his private capacity, and, as he is liable only for the damage which he has attempted to work, he must repay the stolen goods twofold
<note n="8.9.c">Ex. xxii. 4. LXX “if the thing stolen be left and found in his hand, from an ass to a sheep alive, he shall repay them double.” Philo’s generalization is supported by <hi rend="italic">v.</hi> 7, where it says of goods stolen from a neighbour to whom they have been given to keep “if the thief is found, he shall repay double.” So also <hi rend="italic">v.</hi> 9.

   Nor



need he complain because he has to repay twice the value of the stolen goods, or even if he is sold. For he is guilty in several ways. First because dissatisfied with what he has he desires a greater abundance and thus fortifies the malignant and well-nigh deadly passion of coveteousness. Secondly because it is the property of others which he eyes so avidly and sets his snares to secure for himself and deprive the owners of their possession. Thirdly because the concealment which he also practises, while it secures him the profits of the business often for his sole enjoyment, leads him to divert the charge in each case to innocent persons and so blindfold the quest for the truth.</p></div>



<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="6"><p> It would



seem too that he is his own accuser, since his conscience convicts him when he filches in this stealthy way, for he must be actuated by shame or fear.

  as it is founded on the good faith of the person who accepts it. Formal loans are guaranteed by contracts and written documents, and articles lent openly without such formality have the testimony of the eye-witnessess.

But that is not the method of deposits.</p></div>



<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="31"><p>



There a man gives something with his own hands secretly to another when both are alone. He looks carefully all round him and does not even bring a slave, however loyal, with him to act as carrier, for the object which both of them evidently pursue is that it should be impossible to show what has happened. The one wishes that nobody should observe his gift, the other that no one should know of his acceptance. And this unseen transaction has assuredly the unseen God as its intermediary,



<pb n="27"/>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="32"><p> So then he who repudiates a deposit



must be assured that he acts most wrongfully. He deceives the hopes of the friend who confided his goods to him. He has disguised under fair words the vileness of his character. In the faithlessness of his heart he has assumed the mask of a bastard faithfulness. The assurance of the hands given and taken is rendered null and void, the oaths are unfulfilled. Thus he has set at nought both the human and the divine and repudiated two trusts, one that of him who consigned his property, the other that of the most veracious of witnesses who sees and hears all whether they intend or do not wish to do what they say.</p></div>



<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="33"><p>

Heinemann, “whether they wish (to be seen and heard) or not,” “mag es ihnen lieb oder unlieb sein,” also seems pointless and besides misses the sense of intention in προαιρουμένων.</note>
  But if the deposit, which

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="35"><p><milestone unit="para"/>But deposits include not only inanimate things



but living animals who are liable to be endangered in two ways: one by theft which they share with the inanimate, the other by death which is peculiar to themselves. The first of these has been dealt with above and we must proceed to lay down laws for the second.</p></div>



<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="36"><p>
<note n="8.29.e">For this section see Ex. xxii. 9–13. Philo’s explanation is a simplification of what, particularly in the LXX, is a confusing passage. In <hi rend="italic">v.</hi> 9 it is stated that in the case of any loss, animals included, the disputants will appear “before God” and the person convicted will pay compensation. The verse, which may be out of place, does not seem to refer particularly to depostit, but coming where it does, Philo would naturally conclude that it did so refer, and sup- pose that it means that the oath, unless shown to be false, would clear the depositary. Verses 10–12 state that if an animal deposited in trust has been wounded or dies or has been carried away captive, “and no one knows it,” the oath will clear him, but adds that if it is stolen, the depositary must make it good. Verse 13 says that if it has been torn by wild beasts, he must take the owner to the fragments of the corpse (ἄξει ἐπὶ τὴν θήραν) and so clear himself. Philo ignores the difficulty in <hi rend="italic">v</hi>. 12, “if it has been stolen he shall pay compensation,” and falls back upon the general principle that the oath is to be trusted. Also from the statement that the fragments of the torn animal are sufficient evidence, he seems to argue that the same must hold good of any dead animal if the owner is accessible, and that therefore the oath in this case is not needed.</note>
  So if any animal left in trust dies



the person who has accepted the trust must send for the consigner and show him the dead body, thus shielding himself against any suspicion of dishonesty. If the consigner is absent from home, it would not be right for the caretaker to summon







<pb n="31"/>





other people from whom the depositor may have wished to keep the matter secret, but when he has come home he must swear to him to show that he is not using a fictitious death to cloak an embezzlement.</p></div>



<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="37"><p>
<note n="8.31.a">For this section see Ex. xxii. 14, 15. LXX “If anyone ask from his neighbour and it is wounded (or broken) or die or is carried away captive, and the owner is not with it, he shall make compensation. But if the owner is with it, he shall not make compensation.” Philo interprets the request (or borrowing) to apply to other things besides animals, and “carried away captive” (αἰχμάλωτον γένηται) to include stealing, and “be with it,” which presumably means that he is present when the mishap occurs, to mean as above, “be accessible.” The last half of the verse, which is very obscure, he leaves alone.</note>
  But if any utensil or any animal has



been received not as a trust but for his use in response to a request and then either
<note n="8.31.b">Lit. “both,” meaning that both are liable to be stolen, but not to die.</note>
  of these is stolen, or the animal dies, the borrower will not be responsible if the lender is living on the spot, since he can call him to witness that there is no pretence. If he is not living on the spot the borrower must make good the loss. Why is this?</p></div>



<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="38"><p>



Because in the absence of the owner the borrower may either have worn out the animal by constantly overworking it and so have caused its death, or may have risked

  Any kind which lacks both or one of these is unclean. Now both these two are symbols to teacher and learner of the method best suited for acquiring knowledge, the method by which the better is distinguished from the worse, and thus confusion is avoided.</p></div>



<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="107"><p> For just as a cud-chewing animal after 



biting through the food keeps it at rest in the gullet, again after a bit draws it up and masticates it and then passes it on to the belly, so the pupil after receiving from the teacher through his ears the principles and lore of wisdom prolongs the process of learning, as he cannot at once apprehend and grasp them securely, till by using memory to call up each thing that he has heard by constant exercises which act as the cement of conceptions, he stamps a firm impression of them on his soul.</p></div>

Heinemann translates “Vielhufer”; Mangey “quae plures ungulas habent.” All I can suggest is that Philo supposes that, as the stress is laid upon the “two” in διχηλεῖν, if there are animals πολύχηλα. they will be unclean also.

<milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="24"/> For the essence or substance of that other soul is divine spirit, a truth vouched for by Moses especially, who in his story of the creation says that God breathed a breath of life upon the first man, the founder of our race, into the lordliest part of his body, the face,

I greatly prefer the more forcible reading of the LXX, which is by no means an absurd exaggeration. A state of great religious excitement does produce an independence of food. Compare the description in <hi rend="italic">De Vit. Cont.</hi> 35 of the Therapeutae who “feasting on the rich banquet of doctrines” abstained from food for three or even six days.</note>
  would have abstained from fleshly food. Instead they spurred on their lusts more than before and hastened to grasp what seemed so great a boon.

  common to all which fit in not with some particular number
<note n="8.91.c">Here as in ii. 63, where see note, I see no reason to depart from the established rule that ὡς ἔπος εἰπεῖν does not introduce a metaphor but a general or rough statement, particularly of numbers. “One or two” are examples; any law might conceivably fit in to three or four or any other number short of ten.

</p></div>



<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="136"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="26"/> One and by no means an inconsiderable 



part of justice is that which is concerned with law courts and judges. This I have already

As it is not my custom to repeat myself unless forced to do so by the pressure of the particular occasion I will say no more about it and with only so much preface address myself to the other parts of the subject. 
  </p></div>



<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="137"><p>
  The law tells us that we must set the  rules of justice in the heart and fasten them for a sign upon the hand and have them shaking before the eyes.
<note n="8.93.b">Deut. vi. 6, 8 (also xi. 18). E.V. “These words, which I command thee this day, shall be upon thy heart . . . and thou shalt bind them for a sign upon thy hand, and for frontlets between thine eyes.” In both places the word translated “frontlets” (whence the (head) phylacteries of Matt, xxiii. 5) is given in the LXX by ἀσάλευτον “unshaken.” The sequel shows that Philo read σαλευτόν. See App. p. 435. Actually these words prescribe obedience to God’s law, and so belong rather to εὐσέβεια. Heinemann suggests that the description of them as δικαιώματα in <hi rend="italic">v.</hi> 3 may have led him to dwell upon them here. Perhaps it is enough to say that as the Deuteronomic code, which he mostly quotes in the sequel, is largely concerned with δικαιοσύνη, they may be fairly quoted here, though they have other applications also.</note>
  The first of these is a parable indicating that the rules of justice must not be committed to







<pb n="95"/>





untrustworthy ears since no trust can be placed in the sense of hearing but that these best of all lessons must be impressed upon our lordliest part, stamped too with genuine seals.</p></div>



<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="138"><p> The second 



shows that we must not only receive conceptions of the good but express our approval of them in unhesitating action, for the hand is the symbol of action, and on this the law bids us fasten and hang the rules of justice for a sign. Of what it is a sign he has not definitely stated because, I believe, they are a sign not of one thing but of many, practically of all the factors in human life.</p></div>



<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="139"><p> The third means that 



always and everywhere we must have the vision of them as it were close to our eyes. And they must have vibration and movement, it continues, not to make them unstable and unsettled, but that by their motion they may provoke the sight to gain a clear discernment of them. For motion induces the use of the faculty of sight by stimulating and arousing the eyes, or rather by making them unsleepful and wakeful.</p></div>



<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="140"><p>  He to whom it is 



given to set their image in the eye of the soul, not at rest but in motion and engaged in their natural activities, must be placed on record as a perfect man. No longer must he be ranked among the disciples and pupils but among the teachers and instructors, and he should provide as from a fountain to the young who are willing to draw therefrom a plenteous stream of discourses and doctrines. And









<pb n="97"/>





if some less courageous spirit hesitates through modesty and is slow to come near to learn, that teacher should go himself and pour into his ears as into a conduit a continuous flood of instruction until the cisterns of the soul are filled.</p></div>



<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="141"><p> Indeed he 



must be forward to teach the principles of justice to kinsfolk and friends and all the young people at home and in the street, both when they go to their beds and when they arise, so that in every posture and every motion, in every place both private and public, not only when they are awake but when they are asleep, they may be gladdened by visions of the just.
<note n="8.97.a">Deut. vi. 7 (xi. 19) “thou shalt teach them to thy sons, and shalt talk of them, sitting in the house, and walking in the way and lying down and rising up.”</note>
  For there is no sweeter delight than that the soul should be charged through and through with justice, exercising itself in her eternal principles and doctrines and leaving no vacant place into which unjustice can make its way.</p></div>



<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="142"><p> He bids 



them also write and set them forth in front of the door posts of each house and the gates in their walls,
<note n="8.97.b">Deut. vi. 9 “And ye shall write them on the doorposts of your houses and your gates.”</note>
  so that those who leave or remain at home, citizens and strangers alike, may read the inscriptions engraved on the face of the gates and keep in perpetual memory what they should say and do, careful alike to do and to allow no injustice, and when they enter their houses and again when they go forth men and women and children and servants alike may act as is due and fitting both for others and for themselves.

that nothing should be added or taken away,
<note n="8.99.a">Deut. iv. 2, xii. 32 “ye shall not add to the word which I command you, and ye shall not take from it” (E.V. “diminish”).</note>
  but all the laws originally ordained should be kept unaltered just as they were. For what actually happens, as we clearly see, is that it is the unjust which is added and the just which is taken away, for the wise legislator has omitted nothing which can give possession of justice whole and complete.</p></div>



<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="144"><p> Further he suggests also that the summit of perfection

has been reached in each of the other virtues. For each of them is defective in nothing, complete in its self-wrought consummateness, so that if there be any adding or taking away, its whole being is changed and transformed into the opposite condition.</p></div>

 Here is an example of what I 



mean. That courage, the virtue whose field of action is what causes terror, is the knowledge of what ought to be endured,
<note n="8.99.d">The Stoic definition quoted more completely in <hi rend="italic">Leg. All.</hi> i. 68 ἐπιστήμη ὑπομενετέων καὶ οὐχ ὑπομενέτεων καὶ οὐδετέρων; see <hi rend="italic">S.V.F.</hi> i. 262 ff.</note>
  is known to all who are not completely devoid of learning and culture, even if their contact with education has been but small.</p></div>



<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="146"><p> But if anyone, indulging the ignorance 



which comes from arrogance and believing himself to be a superior person capable of correcting what stands in no such need, ventures to add to or take from courage, he changes its likeness altogether and stamps upon it a form in which ugliness replaces beauty, for by adding he will make rashness and by taking away he will make cowardice, not leaving even the name of the courage so highly profitable to life.</p></div>



<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="147"><p>  In the same way too if one

adds anything small or great to the queen of virtues piety or on the other hand takes something from it, in either case he will change and transform its nature. Addition will beget superstition and subtraction will beget impiety, and so piety too is lost to sight, that sun whose rising and shining is a blessing we may well pray for, because it is the source of the greatest of blessings, since it gives the knowledge of the service of God, which we must hold as lordlier than any lordship, more royal than any sovereignty.</p></div>



<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="148"><p> Much the same may be said

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="149"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="28"/> Another commandment of general value



is “Thou shalt not remove thy neighbour’s landmarks which thy forerunners have set up.”
<note n="8.101.a">Deut. xix. 14. It is difficult to see why this passage is introduced here. The text is clearly quoted not for its literal meaning, but for its application to the customs which are unwritten laws. But the laws which have been and are still to be discussed are not unwritten.</note>
  Now this law, we may consider, applies not merely to allotments and boundaries of land in order to eliminate covetousness but also to the safeguarding of ancient customs. For customs are unwritten laws, the decisions approved by men of old, not inscribed on monuments nor on leaves of paper which the moth destroys, but on the souls of those who are partners in the same citizenship.</p></div>

laws, since he acts under the admonition of restraint and the fear of punishment. But he who faithfully observes the unwritten deserves commendation, since the virtue which he displays is freely willed.

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="151"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="29"/> Some legislators have introduced the



system of filling magistracies by lot, to the detriment of their peoples, for the lot shows good luck, not merit. In fact the lot often falls to many of the unworthy whom a good man, if he obtained command, would reject as unfit to be classed even among his subjects.</p></div>



<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="152"><p> For those “ minor rulers,” as



some phrase it, whom we call “ masters ” do not retain in their service all they might whether homebred or purchased, but only those who prove amenable: the incorrigible they sometimes sell in a mass as unworthy to be slaves of men of merit.</p></div>



<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="153"><p> And can



it then be right to make masters and rulers of whole cities and nations out of persons chosen by lot, by what we may call a blunder of fortune,

  Instead we send one whom we know to have

Such a one will have made many a voyage, crossed all or most seas, carefully studied the trading ports, harbours and anchorages and roadsteads, both in the islands and the mainland, and know the sea routes as well as, if not better than, the roads on land, through accurately watching the heavenly bodies.</p></div>

</p></div>



<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="157"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="30"/> These things Moses,



wise here as ever, considered in his soul and does not even mention appointment of rulers by lot, but determines to institute appointment by election. Thus he says “thou shalt establish a ruler over thyself, not a foreigner but from thy brethren,” hereby indicating that there should be a free choice and an unimpeachable scrutiny of the ruler made by the whole people with the same mind.
<note n="8.105.c">Deut. xvii. 15 “thou shalt surely set over thyself a ruler, whomsoever the Lord thy God shall choose. From thy brethren thou shalt set a ruler over thyself. Thou shalt not be able to set over thyself a man that is a stranger, because he is not thy brother.”</note>
  And the choice will receive the further vote and seal of ratification







<pb n="107"/>





from Him who confirms all things that promote the common weal, even God who holds that the man may be called the chosen from the race, in which he is what the eye is in the body.
<note n="8.107.a">The words are obscure. If the text is right, the meaning may be that the choice of one particular man shows him to be the “eye of the body,” and that God accepts this and confirms it. Philo is clearly trying to reconcile the free choice which he thinks is implied in the words “thou shalt set” with the limitation “whomsoever the Lord thy God Shall choose.” But no authority is quoted for the use of ἐκλογή = “the chosen,” nor yet for “the choicest” or the “pick,” which Cohn’s correction of ἄνθρωπον to αἱρεθέντα demands.</note>
 

</p></div>



<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="158"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="31"/> The



reasons subjoined to show why a foreigner should not be selected are two. First to prevent him from amassing a great quantity of gold and silver and cattle and storing up great wealth all unjustly wrung from the poverty of his subjects.
<note n="8.107.b">Deut. xvii. 16, 17. E.V. “only he shall not multiply horses to himself . . . neither shall he greatly multiply to himself silver and gold.” This is not a reason for not choosing a foreigner, but conditions to be observed by the native king. The LXX however has “because he shall not multiply,” etc., and this Philo follows.</note>
  Secondly that he should not to gratify his own greedy desires evict the natives from the land and compel them to emigrate borne hither and thither in endless wandering, or by inspiring in them futile hopes of increased prosperity succeed in taking from them what ere now they enjoyed in security.</p></div>



<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="159"><p>
<note n="8.107.c">Deut. xvii. 17 (2nd half) “he shall not turn away (E.V. cause to return) the people to Egypt, that he may not multiply horses to himself.” According to the commentators the meaning is that he should not seek alliance with Egypt and so procure a strong force of horses. Philo, perhaps thinking of Egypt as the natural refuge of the exiles from Palestine, takes it to mean expatriation in general, which the foreign king would practise in order to confiscate the people’s wealth. The passage is allegorized in <hi rend="italic">De Agr.</hi> 84 ff. See App. p. 435.</note>
  For he assumed with good



reason that one who was their fellow-tribesman and fellow-kinsman related to them by the tie which brings the highest kinship, the kinship of having one citizenship and the same law and one God who has taken all members of the nation for His portion, would never sin in the way just mentioned. He knew that such a one on the contrary, instead of









<pb n="109"/>





sending the inhabitants adrift, would provide a safe return for those who are scattered on foreign soil, and instead of taking the wealth of others would give liberally to the needy by making his private substance common to all.

</p></div>



<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="160"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="32"/> From the day that he enters upon his



office the lawgiver bids him write out with his own hand this sequel to the laws which embraces them all in the form of a summary.
<note n="8.109.a">Deut. xvii. 18–20. For “sequel” perhaps “appendix.” E.V. “he shall write him a copy of this book” (more literally “duplicate,” Adam Smith). The LXX has δευτερονόμιον (“repetition of the law”), whence the accepted name. On Ἐπινομίδα see also App. p. 436.</note>
  He wishes hereby to have the ordinance cemented to the soul. For the thoughts swept away by the current ebb away from the mere reader, but are implanted and set fast in one who writes them out at leisure. For the mind can dwell at its ease on each point and fix itself upon it, and does not pass on to something else until it has securely grasped what goes before.</p></div>



<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="161"><p> Still after



writing he must endeavour every day to read and familiarize himself with what he has written,
<note n="8.109.b"><hi rend="italic">Ibid.</hi> “he shall read in it all the days of his life.”</note>
  so that he may have a constant and unbroken memory of ordinances so good and profitable to all, and thus conceive an unswerving love and yearning for them by perpetually training and habituating his soul to companionship with holy laws. For prolonged associations produce a pure and sincere affection not only for men but for
<note n="8.109.c">Heinemann translates “thoughts worthy of affection transmitted in writing”; but ἰδέας cannot mean “thoughts.”</note>
  writings of such kinds as are worthy of our love.</p></div>



<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="162"><p> And this will be the case if the ruler studies

<note n="8.111.a">The seven sections which follow are a meditation on Deut. xvii. 19, 20, the first part of which is put into the king or ruler’s mouth.</note>
 “I have written these words, I, a ruler of such eminence, without employing another though I have a host of servants. Have I done it to fill the pages of a book like those who write for hire or to train their eyes and hands, the first to sharpen the sight, the second to make themselves swift writers? No, surely not. I write them in a book in order to rewrite them straightway in my soul, and receive in my mind the imprints of a script more divine and ineffaceable.</p></div>



<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="164"><p> Now other kings carry rods in their

I shall not sway to either side as on a balance, deflecting the ordinances and turning them awry, but I shall try to take them along the central highway marching with firm straightforward steps to ensure a life that never stumbles.”</p></div>



<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="168"><p>
<note n="8.113.a">In this section Philo digresses to bring his text into connexion with Num. xx. 17 (cf. xxi. 22) “We will go along the king’s high way (LXX ὁδὸς βασιλική), we will not turn aside to the right hand nor to the left,” on which he has commented elsewhere, particularly in <hi rend="italic">Quod Deus</hi> 162 ff. Here the stress is laid on the phrase “royal road,” and the inference drawn, as I understand it, is that Moses in giving this name to the central road between (as he says in <hi rend="italic">Quod Deus</hi>) deficiency and excess suggests that it is the fitting road for a king. While hitherto he has chiefly followed the LXX in using ἄρχων, not βασιλεύς, he here shows his perception that a king is intended (cf. § 164).</note>
 Now the name of “royal”



which Moses is wont to give to the central road which lies midway between excess and deficiency, is also given because in a set of three the midmost holds the leading place, joining in union with itself by an indissoluble bond those on either side of it, which also serve as bodyguards to it as to a king.</p></div>



<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="169"><p>

  A law-abiding

  to bribes and gives just judgements justly and ever exercises himself in the laws has, he tells us, for his reward that the days of his government shall be long, not meaning that he grants him long years of life spent in presiding over the State, but to teach the ignorant that the law-abiding ruler, even when deceased, lives an age-long life through the actions which he leaves behind him never to die, monuments of high excellence which can never be destroyed.

<note n="8.113.d">For what follows Philo has no direct pronouncements in the law, but takes the story of Jethro’s advice to Moses in Ex. xviii. described below.</note>
 The person who has been judged worthy



to fill the highest and most important office should choose lieutenants to share with him the duties of governing, giving judgement, and managing all the











<pb n="115"/>





other matters which concern the public welfare. For a single person even though possessed of unique strength both in body and soul would not be capable of coping with the magnitude and multitude of affairs, be he ever so zealous, but would collapse under their force as they pour in upon him daily from different sides, unless he had helpers all of the best chosen for their good sense, ability, justice and godliness, and because they not only keep clear of arrogance but hate it as a thing pernicious and utterly evil.</p></div>



<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="171"><p>
<note n="8.115.a">See Ex. xviii. 21. E.V. “Able men (LXX δυνατούς), such as fear God, men of truth, hating unjust gain” (LXX ὑπερηφανίαν = “arrogance”).</note>
 In such persons the man of high excellence



burdened with state affairs will find assistants and supporters well fitted to join in relieving him and to lighten his task. Further, since the questions which arise are sometimes greater and sometimes less, to prevent his wearing himself out in petty matters he will do rightly in entrusting the smaller to his subordinates, while the greater he will be bound to scrutinize himself with the utmost care.</p></div>



<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="172"><p> And great



questions must not be understood, as some think, to mean cases where both the disputants are distinguished or rich or men in high office but rather where the commoner or the poor or the obscure are disputing with others more powerful, and where their one hope of escaping a fatal disaster lies in the judge.

</p></div>



<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="173"><p><milestone unit="para"/>Both these statements may be justified by clear



examples to be found in the sacred laws, examples which we do well to copy. For there was a time when Moses himself arbitrated questions of justice, labouring from morning till night, but afterwards when his father-in-law arrived and observed the vast







<pb n="117"/>





burden of affairs which oppressed him through the perpetual flood of persons who had questions to settle, he gave the excellent advice that Moses should choose delegates to judge the smaller matters and keep himself in reserve for the greater and thus allow himself time to rest.</p></div>



<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="174"><p> Moses listened to



this truly valuable advice and chose out of the multitude the men of highest repute whom he appointed as subordinate governors and also as judges, bidding them refer the more important suits to himself.</p></div>



<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="175"><p> A record of the course thus



taken is included in the sacred books as a lesson to each generation of rulers, first that they should not, under the impression that they are capable of surveying everything, reject the help of councillors which Moses the supremely wise and beloved of God did not reject; next that they should choose officers to act as second and third to themselves and so take care that they did not by wearing themselves out over petty matters neglect the more vital. For human nature cannot possibly reach everything.

</p></div>



<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="176"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="34"/> I have



stated one of the two examples and must add the evidence for the second. I said that the great cases were those of the lowlier. Lowliness and weakness are attributes of the widow, the orphan and the incomer. It is to these that the supreme king who is invested with the government of all should administer justice, because according to Moses God also the ruler of the Universe has not spurned them from His jurisdiction.</p></div>



<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="177"><p> For when



the Revealer has hymned the excellences of the Self-existent in this manner
<note n="8.117.a">Dent. x. 17, 18.</note>
  “God the great and

powerful, who has no respect to persons, will receive no gifts and executes judgement,” he proceeds to say for whom the judgement is executed—not for satraps and despots and men invested with power by land and sea, but for the “incomer,
<note n="8.119.a">E.V. “stranger.” LXX προσηλύτῳ. Philo, as regularly elsewhere, assumes that he is a proselyte to Judaism.</note>
  for orphan and widow.”</p></div>



<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="178"><p> For the incomer,



because he has turned his kinsfolk, who in the ordinary course of things would be his sole confederates, into mortal enemies, by coming as a pilgrim to truth and the honouring of One who alone is worthy of honour, and by leaving the mythical fables and multiplicity of sovereigns, so highly honoured by the parents and grand-parents and ancestors and blood relations of this immigrant to a better home.  For the orphan, because he has been bereft of his father and mother his natural helpers and champions, deserted by the sole force which was bound to take up his cause. For the widow because she has been deprived of her husband who took over from the parents the charge of guarding and watching over her, since for the purpose of giving protection the husband is to the wife what the parents are to the maiden.</p></div>



<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="179"><p>  One may say that the whole Jewish race is in the



position of an orphan compared with all the nations on every side. They when misfortunes fall upon them which are not by the direct intervention of heaven are never, owing to international intercourse, unprovided with helpers who join sides with them. But the Jewish nation has none to take its part, as it lives under exceptional laws which are necessarily grave and severe, because they inculcate the highest

standard of virtue. But gravity is austere, and austerity is held in aversion by the great mass of men because they favour pleasure.</p></div>



<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="180"><p> Nevertheless as



Moses tells us the orphan-like desolate state of his people is always an object of pity and compassion to the Ruler of the Universe whose portion it is, because it has been set apart out of the whole human race as a kind of first fruits to the Maker and Father.</p></div>



<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="181"><p> And



the cause of this was the precious signs of righteousness and virtue shown by the founders of the race, signs which survive like imperishable plants, bearing fruit that never decays for their descendants, fruit salutary and profitable in every way, even though these descendants themselves be sinners, so long as the sins be curable and not altogether unto death.</p></div>

<note n="8.121.b">So LXX, Lev. xix. 16. E.V. “Thou shalt not go up and down as a tale-bearer among thy people.” Both in the Hebrew and in the LXX, it is no doubt a general precept, but as it is preceded by “in righteousness shalt thou judge thy neighbour,” Phiio might allege some reason for applying it to a person in authority.</note>

  good rulers may be truly called the parents of states and nations in common, since they show a fatherly and sometimes more than fatherly affection.</p></div>



<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="185"><p> But those who assume



great power to destroy and injure their subjects should be called not rulers but enemies acting like foemen in bitter war, though indeed those who do wrong craftily are more wicked than open adversaries.

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="186"><p> Now “rule” or “command”



is a category which extends and intrudes itself, I might almost say, into every branch of life, differing only in magnitude and amount.

All these have power both for good and for worse, but they ought to will the better, and the better is to benefit instead of injuring as many as they possibly can.</p></div>



<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="187"><p> For this is to follow



God since He too can do both but wills the good only. This was shown both in the creation and in the ordering of the world. He called the non-existent into existence and produced order from disorder,

<note n="8.135.b">Lev. xix. 19, Deut. xxii. 9–11. Both passages include the rule of the vineyard and the mixed garment. But in Leviticus the different species are not to mate, in Deuteronomy not to plough together. Philo in the main follows Leviticus, but takes account in §§ 205 f. of Deuteronomy, treating it as an illustration. In E.V. Leviticus has “field” of the second injunction, Deuteronomy “vineyard.” But the LXX has “vineyard” in both.</note>
 He also lays down an ordered series of



injunctions all on the same lines by forbidding them to mate their cattle with those of a different species, or to sow the vineyards for two kinds of fruit, or to wear a garment adulterated
<note n="8.135.c">E.V. “mingled together.” The LXX κίβδηλον, which Philo quotes, probably meant the same, but he could easily read into it the sense of adulterated.</note>
  by weaving it from two materials. The first of these prohibitions has been mentioned in our denunciation of adulterers
<note n="8.135.d">See iii. 46 ff.</note>
  to suggest still more clearly the wickedness of conspiring against the wedlock of other people, thereby ruining the morals of the wives as well as any honest hopes of begetting a legitimate family. For by prohibiting the crossing of irrational animals with different species











<pb n="137"/>





he appears to be indirectly working towards the prevention of adultery.</p></div>



<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="204"><p> But the law should be mentioned



also here, where the theme is justice, for we must not neglect the opportunity where possible of using the same point to bring out more than one moral. Now it is just to join together things which can associate, and the homogeneous are made for association just as the heterogeneous on the other hand cannot be blended or associated, and one who plans to bring them into abnormal companionship is unjust because he upsets a law of nature.</p></div>



<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="205"><p> But the law in its essential



holiness shows such thoughtfulness for what is just that it does not even allow the land to be ploughed by animals of unequal strength and forbids the ass and the young bull to be yoked together for this purpose, lest the weaker partner, forced to compete with the extra power of the stronger, should break down and faint on the way.</p></div>



<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="206"><p> It is true indeed that



the stronger, the bull, is named in the list of clean animals while the weaker, the ass, belongs to the unclean. Nevertheless the law did not grudge the help of justice to the seemingly inferior, in order, I believe, to teach judges a most indispensable lesson that they should not in their judgements set the meanly born at a disadvantage, when the point under examination is not concerned with birth but with good and bad conduct.</p></div>



<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="207"><p>  Also similar to these two



is the last enactment in the group, which forbids wool and linen, substances differing in kind, to be woven together, for in this case not only does the difference forbid association, but also the superior strength of the one will produce a rupture rather than unification when they have to be worn.

</p></div>



<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="208"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="40"/> Midway in the group of the three comes the





<pb n="139"/>





order not to sow the vineyard for bearing two kinds of fruit. The first reason for this is to keep things of a different kind from being mixed and confused. For sown crops have no relation to trees nor trees to sown crops and therefore nature has not appointed the same date to both for producing their annual fruits, but has assigned spring to the one for reaping the corn harvest and the end of summer to the other for gathering the fruits.</p></div>



<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="209"><p> Thus we find that the sown



plants after their flowering wither at the same time as the trees sprout after withering. For the sown plants flower in the winter when the trees shed their leaves while on the contrary in the spring when all the sown plants are withering the trees of both types
<note n="8.139.a">ὕλη is here a collective noun embracing a genus or variety of trees or vegetation. So below § 229 and i. 74 τῆς ἀγρίας ὕλης. This sense is not given in L. &amp; S.</note>
  the cultivated and the wild are sprouting, and practically it is at the same time that the crops reach their fullness and the fruits begin to grow.</p></div>



<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="210"><p> These two so greatly differing in their natures, their



flowerings and their seasons for gendering their own particular products he rightly put asunder and set at a distance from each other, thus reducing disorder to order. For order is akin to seemliness
<note n="8.139.b">This word is very inadequate as a translation for κόσμος here, but I doubt whether any equivalent to it exists in English. It is something higher than mere τάξις, and thus can be used to signify good behaviour and adornment and the perfection of the cosmic system (cf. § 237). Perhaps “harmony” might come nearest to it. Heinemann gives “regularity” and “order” (“Regelmässigkeit“ and “Ordnung”).</note>
  and disorder to unseemliness.</p></div>



<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="211"><p>  The second reason



was to prevent each of the two species from hurting and being hurt in return by abstracting the nourishment from each other. For if this nourishment is divided up, as it is in times of famine and dearth, all the plants will necessarily lose all their strength and either become sterilized and completely unproductive or else bear nothing but poor fruit as a consequence







<pb n="141"/>





of the debility caused by their lack of nourishment.

</p></div>



<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="212"><p>The third reason was that good soil



should not suffer from the pressure of two very heavy burdens, one the close unbroken density of the plants which are sown and grow on the same spot, the other the task of bearing a double crop of fruit. A single yearly tribute from a single piece of ground is enough for the owner to receive, as the same from a city is enough for a king. To attempt to levy more than one toll shows excessive avarice, and that is a vice which upsets the laws of nature.</p></div>



<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="213"><p> And therefore the



law would say to those who are minded to gratify their covetousness by laying down seed in their vineyard “do not show yourselves inferior to kings who have subdued cities and countries by arms and military expeditions. They with an eye to the future and at the same time wishing to spare their subjects deem it best to levy one yearly tribute in order to avoid reducing them in a short space of time
<note n="8.141.a">This use of καιρός for a space of time is strange. Possibly he means “with (i.e. for) a small advantage.” See Dictionary.</note>
  to the utmost depths of poverty.</p></div>



<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="214"><p> But you if you



exact from the same plot in the spring its contributions of wheat and barley and in the summer the same from the fruit trees will wring the life out of it by the double taxation. For it will naturally become exhausted like an athlete who is not allowed a breathing space and a chance of rallying his forces to begin another contest.</p></div>



<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="215"><p> But you appear to forget



too easily the injunctions which I gave for the common weal.

  If only you had remembered my instruction as to the seventh year, in which I laid it down that the holy land should be left at liberty in consideration of its six-years labours, which it underwent

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="216"><p> For he who can bring himself to let his

The LXX has ἵνα μὴ ἁγιασθῇ which Philo, taking ἵνα as often to be consecutive, makes = “so that it is not sanctified.”</note>

  For he who as a commoner has learned to shun unjust gains in the treatment of his plants will, if he becomes a king with greater matters in his charge, follow his acquired habit when he comes to deal with men and also women. He will not exact a double tribute nor wring the life out of his subjects with his imposts. For long familiar habit has the power to soften harsh temperaments and in a sense to tutor and mould them to better forms, and the better forms are those which justice imprints on the soul.

<note n="8.145.b">Deut. xx. 10 ff., which describe the proper conduct of war against distant nations, as opposed to the heathen Canaanites, who are to be exterminated. The curious way in which Philo here limits this to war against those who revolt from an alliance, which might perhaps be taken to include breaking treaties in general, can only be explained, I think, as expressing a conviction that the Law could never have intended to sanction wars of conquest or aggression.</note>
  For



if these revolt, he tells us, and shut themselves up within their walls your well-armed fighting force should advance with its armaments and encamp around them, then wait for a time, not letting anger have free play at the expense of reason, in order that they may take in hand what they have to do in a firmer and steadier spirit.</p></div>

<note n="8.147.a">Verse 11 “they shall become tributary and serve thee,” which Philo much softens down.</note>
  for peace, even if it involves great sacrifices, is more advantageous than war.</p></div>



<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="222"><p> But if the adversaries persist in their rashness to the



point of madness, they must proceed to the attack invigorated by enthusiasm and having in the justice of their cause an invincible ally.

But they must spare the women,
