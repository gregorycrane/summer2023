<head>On the special laws which fall under the two heads of the ten commandments, one of which is directed against the acknowledgement of other sovereign gods<ref target="7-101-a"/>  save the one, and the other against giving honours to the works of men’s hands</head>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="1"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="1"/><ref target="7-101-b"/> The Ten Words, as they are called, the main

heads under which are summarized the Special Laws, have been explained in detail in the preceding treatise. We have now, as the sequence of our dissertation<ref target="7-101-c"/>  requires, to examine the particular ordinances. I will begin with that which is an object of ridicule among many people.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="2"><p> Now the practice

which is thus ridiculed, namely the circumcision of the genital organs, is very zealously observed by many other nations, particularly by the Egyptians, a race regarded as pre-eminent for its populousness, its antiquity and its attachment to philosophy.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="3"><p><ref target="7-101-d"/>  And

therefore it would be well for the detractors to desist from childish mockery and to inquire in a wiser and more serious spirit into the causes to which the



<pb n="103"/>


persistence of this custom is due, instead of dismissing the matter prematurely and impugning the good sense of great nations. Such persons might naturally reflect that all these thousands in every generation undergo the operation and suffer severe pains in mutilating the bodies of themselves and their nearest and dearest, and that there are many circumstances which urge the retention and performance of a custom introduced by the men of old. The principal reasons are four in number.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="4"><p>  One

is that it secures exemption from the severe and almost incurable malady of the prepuce called anthrax or carbuncle, so named, I believe, from the slow fire<ref target="7-103-a"/>  which it sets up and to which those who retain the foreskin are more susceptible.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="5"><p> Secondly, it promotes

the cleanliness of the whole body as befits the consecrated order, and therefore the Egyptians carry the practice to a further extreme and have the bodies of their priests shaved. For some substances which need to be cleared away collect and secrete themselves both in the hair and the foreskin.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="6"><p> Thirdly, it assimilates<ref target="7-103-b"/>  the circumcised member to the

heart. For as both are framed to serve for generation, thought being generated by the spirit force in the heart,<ref target="7-103-c"/>  living creatures by the reproductive organ,






<pb n="105"/>


the earliest men<ref target="7-105-a"/>  held that the unseen and superior element to which the concepts of the mind owe their existence should have assimilated to it the visible and apparent, the natural parent of the things perceived by sense.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="7"><p> The fourth and most vital reason is its

adaptation to give fertility of offspring, for we are told that it causes the semen to travel aright without being scattered or dropped into the folds of the foreskin, and therefore the circumcised nations appear to be the most prolific and populous.
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="8"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="2"/> These are the explanations handed down to us

from the old-time studies of divinely gifted men who made deep research into the writings of Moses. To these I would add that I consider circumcision to be a symbol of two things most necessary to our well-being.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="9"><p> One is the excision of pleasures which bewitch

the mind. For since among the love-lures of pleasure the palm is held by the mating of man and woman, the legislators thought good to dock the organ which ministers to such intercourse, thus making circumcision the figure of the excision of excessive<ref target="7-105-b"/>  and superfluous pleasure, not only of one pleasure but of all the other pleasures signified by one, and that the most imperious.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="10"><p>  The other

reason is that a man should know himself and banish from the soul the grievous malady of conceit. For there are some who have prided themselves on their power of fashioning as with a sculptor’s cunning the fairest of creatures, man, and in their braggart pride assumed godship, closing their eyes to the Cause of all that comes into being, though they might find


<pb n="107"/>


in their familiars a corrective for their delusion.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="11"><p> For

in their midst are many men incapable of begetting and many women barren, whose matings are ineffective and who grow old childless. The evil belief, therefore, needs to be excised from the mind with any others that are not loyal to God.
<milestone unit="para"/>So much for these matters.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="12"><p> We must now turn

to the particular laws, taking those first with which it is well to begin, namely those the subject of which is the sole sovereignty of God.
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="13"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="3"/><ref target="7-107-a"/> Some have supposed that the sun and moon

and the other stars were gods with absolute powers and ascribed to them the causation of all events. But Moses held that the universe was created and is in a sense the greatest of commonwealths, having magistrates and subjects; for magistrates, all the heavenly bodies, fixed or wandering; for subjects, such beings as exist below the moon, in the air or on the earth.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="14"><p> The said magistrates, however, in his view

have not unconditional powers, but are lieutenants of the one Father of All, and it is by copying the example of His government exercised according to law and justice over all created beings that they acquit themselves aright; but those who do not descry the Charioteer mounted above attribute the causation of all the events in the universe to the team that draw the chariot as though they were sole agents.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="15"><p> From this ignorance our most holy lawgiver would

convert them to knowledge with these words: “Do not when thou seest the sun and the moon and the stars and all the ordered host of heaven go astray and


<pb n="109"/>


worship them.”<ref target="7-109-a"/>  Well indeed and aptly does he call the acceptance of the heavenly bodies as gods a going astray or wandering.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="16"><p> For those who see the sun

with its advances and retreats producing the yearly seasons in which the animals and plants and fruits are brought at fixed periods of time from their birth to maturity, and the moon as handmaid and successor to the sun taking over at night the care and supervision of all that he had charge of by day, and the other stars in accordance with their sympathetic affinity to things on earth acting and working in a thousand ways for the preservation of the All, have wandered infinitely far in supposing that they alone are gods.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="17"><p> But if they had been at pains to walk in

that road where there is no straying, they would at once have perceived that just as sense is the servitor of mind, so too all the beings perceived by sense are the ministers of Him who is perceived by the mind. It is enough for them if they gain the second place.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="18"><p> For it is quite ridiculous to deny that if the mind in

us, so exceedingly small and invisible, is yet the ruler of the organs of sense, the mind of the universe, so transcendently great and perfect, must be the King of kings who are seen by Him though He is not seen by them.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="19"><p> So all the gods which sense descries in

Heaven must not be supposed to possess absolute power but to have received the rank of subordinate rulers, naturally liable to correction, though in virtue of their excellence never destined to undergo it.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="20"><p> Therefore carrying our thoughts beyond all the realm

of visible existence let us proceed to give honour to the Immaterial, the Invisible, the Apprehended by the understanding alone, who is not only God of gods, whether perceived by sense or by mind, but

<pb n="111"/>


also the Maker of all. And if anyone renders the worship due to the Eternal, the Creator, to a created being and one later in time, he must stand recorded as infatuated and guilty of impiety in the highest degree.
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="21"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="4"/><ref target="7-111-a"/> There are some who put gold and silver in the

hands of sculptors as though they were competent to fashion gods; and the sculptors taking the crude material and furthermore using mortal form for their model, to crown the absurdity shape gods, as they are supposed to be. And after erecting and establishing temples they have built altars and in their honour hold sacrifices and processions with other religious rites and ceremonies conducted with the most elaborate care, and the vain shew is treated by priests and priestesses with the utmost possible solemnity.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="22"><p> Such idolaters are warned by the Ruler of All in these

words: “Ye shall not make with Me gods of silver and gold,” and the lesson conveyed is little less than a direct command,<ref target="7-111-b"/>  “Neither shall ye make gods the work of your hands from any other material if you are prevented from using the best,” for silver and gold hold first place among the sculptor’s materials.
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="23"><p><milestone unit="para"/>But apart from the literal prohibition,

He seems to me to suggest another thought of great value for the promotion of morality,<ref target="7-111-c"/>  and to condemn strongly the money-lovers who procure gold and silver coins from every side and treasure their hoard like a



<pb n="113"/>


divine image in a sanctuary, believing it to be a source of blessing and happiness of every kind.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="24"><p> And

further, all the needy who are possessed by that grievous malady, the desire for money, though they have no wealth of their own on which they may bestow worship as its due, pay awe-struck homage to that of their neighbours, and come at early dawn to the houses of those who have abundance of it as though they were the grandest temples, there to make their prayers and beg for blessing from the masters as though they were gods.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="25"><p> To such he says

elsewhere “Ye shall not follow idols and ye shall not make molten gods,”<ref target="7-113-a"/>  thus teaching them in a figure that it is not fitting to assign divine honours to wealth. For it is the nature of the far-famed materials of wealth, gold and silver, to melt,<ref target="7-113-b"/>  and they are followed by the multitude who think that what “blind”<ref target="7-113-c"/>  wealth has to give is the sole or the chief source of happiness.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="26"><p> It is these that he calls “idols,” like to

shadows and phantoms, with nothing firm or strong to which they can cling. They are borne along like a restless wind, subject to every kind of change and alteration. And of this we have a clear proof. Sometimes they suddenly light on one who has never owned them ere now: then again, when he thinks that they are firmly grasped, they spring away. And indeed when they are present, the apparition is like idols or images seen through mirrors, deceiving and



<pb n="115"/>


bewitching the sense and seeming to subsist when they have no abiding substance.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="27"><p> And why need we

prove that human riches or human vanity, which empty-headed thinking paints in such bright colours, are unstable? For we know that some<ref target="7-115-a"/>  assert that all other living creatures and plants which are born and perish are in a constant and ceaseless state of flux, though our perception of the effluence is indistinct, because the swiftness of its course always defeats the efforts of the eyesight to observe it with exactness.
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="28"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="5"/> But not only wealth and glory and the like

are idols and unsubstantial shadows, but also all those personages, which the myth-makers have invented and spread delusion therewith, building up their false imaginations into a stronghold to menace the truth, and staging as by machinery<ref target="7-115-b"/>  new gods, in order that the eternal and really existing God might be consigned to oblivion. And to promote the seductiveness they have fitted the falsehood into melody, metre and rhythm,<ref target="7-115-c"/>  thinking to cajole their audience thereby.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="29"><p> Further, too, they have brought

in sculpture and painting to co-operate in the deception, in order that with the colours and shapes and artistic qualities wrought by their fine workmanship they may enthrall the spectators and so beguile the two leading senses, sight and hearing—sight through lifeless shapes of beauty, hearing through the charm of poetry and music—and thus make the soul unsteady and unsettled and seize it for their prey.
<pb n="117"/>

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="30"><p><milestone unit="para"/>Therefore knowing that vanity had attained high

power and was championed by the greater part of the human race, not under compulsion but of their own free will, and fearing lest the devotees of piety, true and incorruptible, might be swept away as by a torrent, he stamped upon their minds as with a seal deep imprints of holiness, so that no fusion or smoothing in the course of years should ever blur their distinctness. This lesson he continually repeats, sometimes saying that God is one and the Framer and Maker of all things, sometimes that He is Lord of created beings, because stability and fixity and lordship are by nature vested in Him alone.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="31"><p> We are

told, too, that “those who cling to the God that is all live.”<ref target="7-117-a"/>  Is not this the thrice-happy and thrice-blessed life, to cling lovingly to the service of the most ancient Cause of all and to reject the thought of serving the menials and the door-keepers rather than the King? This true life stands inscribed on the tables of nature as deathless and agelong, and the writing that records it must endure with the universe to all eternity.
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="32"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="6"/> Doubtless hard to unriddle and hard to apprehend

is the Father and Ruler of all, but that is no reason why we should shrink from searching for Him. But in such searching two principal questions arise which demand the consideration of the genuine philosopher. One is whether the Deity exists, a question necessitated by those who practise atheism, the worst form of wickedness, the other is what the Deity is in essence. Now to answer the first question


<pb n="119"/>


does not need much labour, but the second is not only difficult but perhaps impossible to solve. Still, both must be examined.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="33"><p><ref target="7-119-a"/> We see then that any

piece of work always involves the knowledge of a workman. Who can look upon statutes or painting without thinking at once of a sculptor or painter? Who can see clothes or ships or houses without getting the idea of a weaver and a shipwright and a house-builder? And when one enters a well-ordered city in which the arrangements for civil life are very admirably managed, what else will he suppose but that this city is directed by good rulers?</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="34"><p> So then

he who comes to the truly Great City, this world, and beholds hills and plains teeming with animals and plants, the rivers, spring-fed or winter torrents, streaming along, the seas with their expanses, the air with its happily tempered phases, the yearly seasons passing into each other,<ref target="7-119-b"/>  and then the sun and moon ruling the day and night, and the other heavenly bodies fixed or planetary and the whole firmament revolving in rhythmic order, must he not naturally or rather necessarily gain the conception of the Maker and Father and Ruler also?</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="35"><p> For none of the works

of human art is self-made, and the highest art and knowledge is shewn in this universe, so that surely it has been wrought by one of excellent knowledge and absolute perfection. In this way we have gained the conception of the existence of God.
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="36"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="7"/> As for the divine essence, though in fact it is


<pb n="121"/>


hard to track and hard to apprehend, it still calls for all the inquiry possible. For nothing is better than to search for the true God, even if the discovery of Him eludes human capacity, since the very wish to learn, if earnestly entertained, produces untold joys and pleasures.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="37"><p> We have the testimony of those who

have not taken a mere sip of philosophy but have feasted more abundantly on its reasonings and conclusions. For with them the reason soars away from earth into the heights, travels through the upper air and accompanies the revolutions of the sun and moon and the whole heaven and in its desire to see all that is there finds its powers of sight blurred, for so pure and vast is the radiance that pours therefrom that the soul’s eye is dizzied by the flashing of the rays.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="38"><p> Yet it does not therefore faintheartedly give up the

task, but with purpose unsubdued presses onwards to such contemplation as is possible, like the athlete who strives for the second prize since he has been disappointed of the first. Now second to the true vision stands conjecture and theorizing and all that can be brought into the category of reasonable probability.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="39"><p> So then just as, though we do not know

and cannot with certainty determine what each of the stars is in the purity of its essence, we eagerly persist in the search because our natural love of learning makes us delight in what seems probable, </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="40"><p>so too,
though the clear vision of God as He really is is denied us, we ought not to relinquish the quest. For the very seeking, even without finding, is felicity in itself, just as no one blames the eyes of the body because when unable to see the sun itself they see the emanation of its rays as it reaches the earth, which is but the extremity of the brightness which the beams of

<pb n="123"/>


the sun give forth.
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="41"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="8"/> It was this

which Moses the sacred guide, most dearly beloved of God, had before his eyes when he besought God with the words, “Reveal Thyself to me.”<ref target="7-123-a"/>  In these words we may almost hear plainly the inspired cry” This universe has been my teacher, to bring me to the knowledge that Thou art and dost subsist. As Thy son, it has told me of its Father, as Thy work of its contriver. But what Thou art in Thy essence I desire to understand, yet find in no part of the All any to guide me to this knowledge.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="42"><p> Therefore I pray and

beseech Thee to accept the supplication of a suppliant, a lover of God, one whose mind is set to serve Thee alone; for as knowledge of the light does not come by any other source but what itself supplies, so too Thou alone canst tell me of Thyself. Wherefore I crave pardon if, for lack of a teacher, I venture to appeal to Thee in my desire to learn of Thee.”</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="43"><p> He replies, “Thy zeal I approve as praiseworthy, but

the request cannot fitly be granted to any that are brought into being by creation. I freely bestow what is in accordance with the recipient; for not all that I can give with ease is within man’s power to take, and therefore to him that is worthy of My grace I extend all the boons which he is capable of receiving.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="44"><p> But the apprehension of Me is something more than

human nature, yea even the whole heaven and


<pb n="125"/>


universe will be able to contain. Know thyself, then, and do not be led away by impulses and desires beyond thy capacity, nor let yearning for the unattainable uplift and carry thee off thy feet, for of the obtainable nothing shall be denied thee.”</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="45"><p>  When

Moses heard this, he addressed to Him a second petition and said, ” I bow before Thy admonitions, that I never could have received the vision of Thee clearly manifested, but I beseech Thee that I may at least see the glory that surrounds Thee, and by Thy glory I understand the powers that keep guard around Thee, of whom I would fain gain apprehension, for though hitherto that has escaped me, the thought of it creates in me a mighty longing to have knowledge of them.”</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="46"><p> To this He answers, “The powers which

thou seekest to know are discerned not by sight but by mind even as I, Whose they are, am discerned by mind and not by sight, and when I say ‘they are discerned by mind’ I speak not of those<ref target="7-125-a"/>  which are now actually apprehended by mind but mean that if these other powers could be apprehended it would not be by sense but by mind at its purest.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="47"><p> But while in their

essence they are beyond your apprehension, they nevertheless present to your sight a sort of impress and copy of their active working. You men have for your use seals which when brought into contact with wax or similar material stamp on them any number of impressions while they themselves are not docked in any part thereby but remain as they were. Such you must conceive My powers to be, supplying quality and shape to things which lack either and yet changing or lessening nothing of their eternal nature.


<pb n="127"/>


</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="48"><p>Some among you call them not inaptly ‘forms’ or

‘ideas,’<ref target="7-127-a"/>  since they bring form into everything that is, giving order to the disordered, limit to the unlimited, bounds to the unbounded, shape to the shapeless, and in general changing the worse to something better.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="49"><p> Do not, then, hope to be ever able to apprehend Me

or any of My powers in Our essence. But I readily and with right goodwill will admit you to a share of what is attainable. That means that I bid you come and contemplate the universe and its contents, a spectacle apprehended not by the eye of the body but by the unsleeping eyes of the mind.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="50"><p><ref target="7-127-b"/>  Only let there

be the constant and profound longing for wisdom which fills its scholars and disciples with verities glorious in their exceeding loveliness.” When Moses heard this, he did not cease from his desire but kept the yearning for the invisible aflame in his heart.
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="51"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="9"/> All of like sort to him, all who spurn idle fables

and embrace truth in its purity, whether they have been such from the first or through conversion to the better side have reached that higher state, obtain His<ref target="7-127-c"/>  approval, the former because they were not false to the nobility of their birth, the latter because their judgement led them to make the passage to piety. These last he calls “proselytes,” or newly-joined, because they have joined the new and godly




<pb n="129"/>


commonwealth.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="52"><p><ref target="7-129-a"/>   Thus, while giving equal rank

to all in-comers with all the privileges which he gives to the native-born, he exhorts the old nobility to honour them not only with marks of respect but with special friendship and with more than ordinary good-will.<ref target="7-129-b"/>  And surely there is good reason for this; they have left, he says, their country, their kinsfolk and their friends for the sake of virtue and religion. Let them not be denied another citizenship or other ties of family and friendship, and let them find places of shelter standing ready for refugees to the camp of piety. For the most effectual love-charm, the chain which binds indissolubly the goodwill which makes us one is to honour the one God.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="53"><p>  Yet he

counsels them that they must not, presuming on the equal privilege and equal rank which He grants them because they have denounced the vain imaginings of their fathers and ancestors, deal in idle talk or revile with an unbridled tongue the gods whom others acknowledge,<ref target="7-129-c"/>  lest they on their part be moved to utter profane words against Him Who truly is. For they know not the difference, and since the falsehood has been taught to them as truth from childhood and has grown up with them, they will go astray.
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="54"><p><milestone unit="para"/>But if any members of the nation betray the honour


<pb n="131"/>


due to the One they should suffer the utmost penalties. They have abandoned their most vital duty, their service in the ranks of piety and religion, have chosen darkness in preference to the brightest light and blindfolded the mind which had the power of keen vision.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="55"><p><ref target="7-131-a"/> And it is well that all who have a zeal for

virtue should be permitted to exact the penalties offhand and with no delay, without bringing the offender before jury or council or any kind of magistrate at all, and give full scope to the feelings which possess them, that hatred of evil and love of God which urges them to inflict punishment without mercy on the impious. They should think that the occasion has made them councillors, jurymen, high sheriffs,<ref target="7-131-b"/>  members of assembly, accusers, witnesses, laws, people, everything in fact, so that without fear or hindrance they may champion religion in full security.
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="56"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="10"/> There is recorded in the Laws

the example of one who acted with this admirable courage.<ref target="7-131-c"/>  He had seen some persons consorting with foreign women and through the attraction of their love-charms spurning their ancestral customs and seeking admission to the rites of a fabulous religion. One in particular he saw, the chief ringleader of the backsliding, who had the audacity to exhibit his unholy conduct in public and was openly offering sacrifices, a travesty of the name, to images of wood and stone in the presence of the whole people. So, seized with inspired fury, keeping back the throng of spectators



<pb n="133"/>


on either side, he slew without a qualm him and her, the man because he listened to lessons which it were a gain to unlearn, the woman because she had been the instructor in wickedness.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="57"><p> This deed suddenly

wrought in the heat of excitement acted as a warning to multitudes who were preparing to make the same apostasy. So then God, praising his high achievement, the result of zeal self-prompted and wholehearted, crowned him with a twofold award, the gifts of peace and priesthood, the first because He judged the champion who had battled for the honour of God worthy to claim a life free from war, the second because the guerdon most suitable to a man of piety is the priestly office which professes the service of the Father, bondage to Whom is better not only than freedom but also than kingship.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="58"><p><ref target="7-133-a"/> But

some labour under a madness carried to such an extravagant extent that they do not leave themselves any means of escape to repentance, but press to enter into bondage to the works of men and acknowledge it by indentures not written on pieces of parchment, but, as is the custom of slaves, branded on their bodies with red-hot iron. And there they remain indelibly, for no lapse of time can make them fade.
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="59"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="11"/> The like principle<ref target="7-133-b"/>  is clearly maintained in

the case of everything else by the most holy Moses, who loves and teaches the truth which he desires to engrave and stamp on all his disciples, dislodging and banishing false opinions to a distance from their


<pb n="135"/>


understanding.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="60"><p> Thus, knowing that the erring life

of the multitude is greatly helped on its way into the wilds by the art of divination, he forbids them to use any of its forms and expels from his own commonwealth all its fawning followers, haruspices, purificators,
augurs, interpreters of prodigies, incantators,<ref target="7-135-a"/>  and those who put their faith in sounds and voices.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="61"><p> For all these are but guessing at what is plausible and

probable, and the same phenomena present to them ideas which differ at different times because the things on which they are based have no natural stability nor has the understanding acquired any accurate touchstone by which the genuine can be tested and approved.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="62"><p> All these pave the way for

impiety. Why so? Because he who pays attention and puts confidence in them is spurning the Cause of all in his belief that they are the sole causes of good and evil and fails to perceive that the anchors on which he moors his life and its cares are utterly insecure, such as birds and wings and their flight hither and thither through the air, and grovelling reptiles which crawl out of their holes to seek their food; and again entrails and blood and corpses which deprived of life at once collapse and decompose and in this process exchange their natural properties for others of worse condition.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="63"><p> Moses demands that

one who is registered in the commonwealth of the laws should be perfect not in the lore, in which the many are schooled, of divination and voices and


<pb n="137"/>


plausible conjectures, but in his duties towards God in which there is nothing doubtful or ambiguous but undoubted, naked truth.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="64"><p><ref target="7-137-a"/> But since a

longing to know the future is ingrained in all men, which longing makes them turn to haruspication and the other forms of divination in the prospect of finding certainty thereby, though actually they are brimful of uncertainty and constantly convict themselves of falsehood—while he very earnestly forbids them to follow such, yet he tells them that if they do not swerve from piety they will not be denied the full knowledge of the future.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="65"><p> A prophet possessed

by God will suddenly appear and give prophetic oracles.<ref target="7-137-b"/>  Nothing of what he says will be his own, for he that is truly under the control of divine inspiration has no power of apprehension when he speaks but serves as the channel for the insistent<ref target="7-137-c"/>  words of Another’s prompting. For prophets are the interpreters of God, Who makes full use of their organs of speech to set forth what He wills. These and the like are his injunctions as to the conception of the one truly existing God. Having opened with them, he next proceeds to indicate how the honours due to Him should be paid.
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="66"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="12"/><ref target="7-137-d"/>  The highest, and in the truest sense the holy,

temple of God is, as we must believe, the whole universe, having for its sanctuary the most sacred part of all existence, even heaven, for its votive ornaments the stars, for its priests the angels who are servitors to His powers, unbodied souls, not compounds



<pb n="139"/>


of rational and irrational nature, as ours are, but with the irrational eliminated, all mind through and through, pure intelligences, in the likeness of the monad.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="67"><p><ref target="7-139-a"/>  There is also the temple made by hands; for

it was right that no check should be given to the forwardness of those who pay their tribute to piety and desire by means of sacrifices either to give thanks for the blessings that befall them or to ask for pardon and forgiveness for their sins. But he provided that there should not be temples built either in many places or many in the same place, for he judged that since God is one, there should be also only one temple.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="68"><p><ref target="7-139-b"/>  Further, he does not consent to those who wish to

perform the rites in their houses, but bids them rise up from the ends of the earth and come to this temple. In this way he also applies the severest test to their dispositions. For one who is not going to sacrifice in a religious spirit would never bring himself to leave his country and friends and kinsfolk and sojourn in a strange land, but clearly it must be the stronger attraction of piety which leads him to endure separation from his most familiar and dearest friends who form as it were a single whole with himself.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="69"><p>  And we have the surest proof of this in what actually

happens. Countless multitudes from countless cities come, some over land, others over sea, from east and west and north and south at every feast. They take the temple for their port as a general haven and safe refuge from the bustle and great turmoil of life, and there they seek to find calm weather, and, released from the cares whose yoke has been heavy upon them from their earliest years, to enjoy a brief breathing-space in scenes of genial cheerfulness.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="70"><p> Thus filled


<pb n="141"/>


with comfortable hopes they devote the leisure, as is their bounden duty,<ref target="7-141-a"/>  to holiness and the honouring of God. Friendships are formed between those who hitherto knew not each other, and the sacrifices and libations are the occasion of reciprocity of feeling and constitute the surest pledge that all are of one mind.
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="71"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="13"/><ref target="7-141-b"/> This temple is enclosed by an outermost

wall of very great length and breadth, which gains additional solidity by four porticos so adorned as to present a very costly appearance. Each of them is twofold,<ref target="7-141-c"/>  and the stone and timber used as its materials and supplied in abundance, combined with the skill of experienced craftsmen and the care bestowed on it by the master-builders, have produced a very perfect piece of work. The inner walls are smaller and in a severer style of architecture.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="72"><p> Right in the very middle stands the sanctuary itself

with a beauty baffling description, to judge from what is exposed to view. For all inside is unseen except by the high priest alone, and indeed he, though charged with the duty of entering once a year, gets no view of anything.<ref target="7-141-d"/>  For he takes with him a brazier full of lighted coals and incense,<ref target="7-141-e"/>  and the great quantity of vapour which this naturally gives forth covers everything around it, beclouds the eyesight and prevents it from being able to penetrate to any. distance.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="73"><p> The huge size and height of the


<pb n="143"/>


sanctuary make it in spite of its comparatively low situation as prominent an object as any of the highest mountains. In fact, so vast are the buildings that they are seen conspicuously and strike the eye with admiration, especially in the case of foreign visitors, who compare them with the architecture of their own public edifices and are amazed both at their beauty and magnificence.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="74"><p>  But there is no grove within the walled area by

order of the law, for many reasons.<ref target="7-143-a"/> First, because the temple which is truly holy does not seek to provide pleasure and hours of easy enjoyment but the austerity of religion; secondly, because the means used to promote the verdure of trees, being the excrements of men and irrational animals, cannot be brought in there without profanity; thirdly, because the plants of the wild kind of vegetation are of no use, but only, as the poets say, “a burden to the soil,”<ref target="7-143-b"/>  while those of the cultivated variety which produce fruits of the same quality will distract the weak-minded from the solemnity of the sacred rites.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="75"><p> Furthermore, overgrown places and

dense thickets are the resort of malefactors, who use their obscurity for their own safety and as an ambush whence they can suddenly attack whomsoever they wish. Broad spaces and openness and absence of restriction on every side, where there is nothing to hinder the sight, are most suitable to a temple, to enable those who enter and spend their time there to have an accurate view.
<pb n="145"/>

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="76"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="14"/> The revenues of the temple are derived not

only from landed estates but also from other and far greater sources which time will never destroy. For as long as the human race endures, and it will endure for ever, the revenues of the temple also will remain secure co-eternal with the whole universe.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="77"><p> For it is

ordained that everyone, beginning at his twentieth year, should make an annual contribution of first-fruits.<ref target="7-145-a"/>  These contributions are called “ransom money,” and therefore the first-fruits are given with the utmost zeal. The donors bring them cheerfully and gladly, expecting that the payment will give them release from slavery or healing of diseases and the enjoyment of liberty fully secured and also complete preservation from danger.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="78"><p> As the nation is

very populous, the offerings of first-fruits are naturally exceedingly abundant. In fact, practically in every city there are banking places for the holy money where people regularly come and give their offerings. And at stated times there are appointed to carry the sacred tribute envoys selected on their merits, from every city those of the highest repute, under whose conduct the hopes of each and all will travel safely. For it is on these first-fruits, as prescribed by the law, that the hopes of the pious rest.
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="79"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="15"/><ref target="7-145-b"/>  The nation has twelve tribes, but one out

of these was selected on its special merits for the priestly office, a reward granted to them for their gallantry and godly zeal on an occasion<ref target="7-145-c"/>  when the multitude was seen to have fallen into sin through


<pb n="147"/>


following the ill-judged judgement of some who persuaded them to emulate the foolishness of Egypt and the vainly imagined fables current in that land, attached to irrational animals and especially to bulls. For the men of this tribe at no bidding but their own made a wholesale slaughter of all the leaders of the delusion and thus carrying to the end their championship of piety were held to have done a truly religious deed.
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="80"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="16"/> With regard to the priests there are the

following laws. It is ordained that the priest should be perfectly sound throughout, without any bodily deformity.<ref target="7-147-a"/>  No part, that is, must be lacking or have been mutilated, nor on the other hand redundant, whether the excrescence be congenital or an after-growth due to disease. Nor must the skin have been changed into a leprous state or into malignant tetters or warts or any other eruptive growth. All these seem to me to symbolize perfection of soul.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="81"><p> For if

the priest’s body, which is mortal by nature, must be scrutinized to see that it is not afflicted by any serious misfortune, much more is that scrutiny needed for the immortal soul, which we are told was fashioned after the image of the Self-existent.<ref target="7-147-b"/>  And the image of God is the Word through whom the whole universe was framed.
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="82"><p><milestone unit="para"/>After providing for his pure descent from a noble

stock and his perfection both of body and soul, the legislation deals with the dress which the priest must assume when he is about to carry out the sacred rites.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="83"><p> It consists of a linen tunic and short breeches, the

latter to cover the loins, which must not be exposed


<pb n="149"/>


at the altar, while the tunic is to make them nimble in their ministry.<ref target="7-149-a"/>  For in this undress,<ref target="7-149-b"/>  with nothing more than the short tunics, they are attired so as to move with unhampered rapidity when they bring the victims and the votive offerings<ref target="7-149-c"/>  and the libations and all other things needed for the sacrifices.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="84"><p> The

high priest is bidden to put on a similar dress<ref target="7-149-d"/>  when he enters the inner shrine to offer incense, because its fine linen is not, like wool, the product of creatures subject to death, and also to wear another, the formation of which is very complicated.<ref target="7-149-e"/>  In this it would seem to be a likeness and copy of the universe. This is clearly shewn by the design.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="85"><p> In the first

place, it is a circular garment of a dark blue colour throughout, a tunic with a full-length skirt, thus symbolizing the air, because the air is both naturally black and in a sense a full-length robe stretching from the sublunar region above to the lowest recesses of the earth.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="86"><p> Secondly, on this is set a piece

of woven work in the shape of a breastplate, which symbolizes heaven. For on the shoulder-points there are two emerald stones, a kind of substance which is exceedingly valuable. There is one of these on each side and both are circular, representing the hemispheres, one of which is above and one under



<pb n="151"/>


earth.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="87"><p> Then on the breast there are twelve

precious stones of different colours, arranged in four rows of three each, set in this form on the model of the zodiac, for the zodiac consisting of twelve signs makes the four seasons of the year by giving three signs to each.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="88"><p><ref target="7-151-a"/> This part of the dress as

a whole is significantly called the reason-seat, because heaven and its contents are all framed and ordered on rational principles and proportions, for nothing there is irrational. On the reason-seat he embroidered two pieces of woven work, one of which he called Clear Shewing and the other Truth.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="89"><p> By

Truth he suggests the thought that no falsehood is allowed to set foot in heaven but has been banished entirely to the earthly regions and has its lodging in the souls of accursed men: by Clear Shewing that the heavenly beings make clear all things that we are or do, which in themselves would be altogether unknown. Here is a self-evident proof.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="90"><p> If the light

of the sun had never shone, how could the numberless qualities of bodily things have been perceived? Or the multiform varieties of colours and shapes?<ref target="7-151-b"/> Who else could have shewn us nights and days and months and years and time in general except the revolutions, harmonious and grand beyond all description, of the sun and the moon and the other stars?</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="91"><p> How but


<pb n="153"/>


through the same heavenly bodies teaching us to compute the divisions of time could we have learnt the nature of number? Who could have opened and shewn to the voyager his path through the seas and all the expanses of the deep had not the stars as they wheel and revolve in their courses done the work?</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="92"><p> Numberless other phenomena have been observed and

recorded by wise men who by study of the heavenly bodies have marked the signs of calm weather and stormy winds, of plentifulness and scarcity of crops, of mild and scorching summers, of sinister and spring-like winters, of droughts and rainy seasons, of fecundity in animals and plants and on the other hand of sterility in both and all other matters of the same kind. For of all the things that happen upon earth, the signs are graven in the face of heaven.
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="93"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="17"/> At the very lowest part of the skirt there

are appended golden pomegranates and bells and flower-work, symbols of earth and water: the flower patterns of earth because they grow and flower out of it, the pomegranate or flowing fruit, of water, the name preserving its derivation from “flowing,” while the bells shew forth the harmony and concord and unison of the parts of the universe.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="94"><p> The order in

which the parts are arranged is also admirable. At the very top is what he calls the breastpiece in which are placed the stones, a copy of heaven because heaven also is at the top. Then under it the full-length skirt, dark blue right through because the air also is black and occupies the second position below the heaven, and the flower-work and pomegranates at the extremities because to earth and water is allotted the lowest place in the universe.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="95"><p> Such is

the form in which the sacred vesture was designed,

<pb n="155"/>


a copy of the universe, a piece of work of marvellous beauty to the eye and the mind. To the eye it presents a most amazing appearance transcending any woven work that we possess in variety and costliness, to the mind the philosophical conceptions which its parts suggest.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="96"><p> For it expresses the wish first

that the high priest should have in evidence upon him an image of the All, that so by constantly contemplating it he should render his own life worthy of the sum of things, secondly that in performing his holy office he should have the whole universe as his fellow-ministrant. And very right and fit it is that he who is consecrated to the Father of the world should take with him also that Father’s son, the universe, for the service of the Creator and Begetter.
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="97"><p><milestone unit="para"/>There is also a third truth symbolized

by the holy vesture which must not be passed over in silence. Among the other nations the priests are accustomed to offer prayers and sacrifices for their kinsmen and friends and fellow-countrymen only, but the high priest of the Jews makes prayers and gives thanks not only on behalf of the whole human race but also for the parts of nature, earth, water, air, fire. For he holds the world to be, as in very truth it is, his country, and in its behalf he is wont to propitiate the Ruler with supplication and intercession, beseeching Him to make His creature a partaker of His own kindly and merciful nature.
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="98"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="18"/><ref target="7-155-a"/>  After saying this by way of prelude, he

proceeds to lay down another statute commanding that he who approaches the altar and handles the sacrifices should not during the time in which it is his duty to perform the sacred rites drink wine or any other intoxicant, and this for four most cogent reasons:

<pb n="157"/>


the dangers of slackness, forgetfulness, sleep and foolish behaviour.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="99"><p> For strong drink enervates the

bodily faculties, and makes the limbs more difficult to move, increases the tendency to sluggishness in a man, and irresistibly forces him to fall asleep, while by relaxing the sinews of the soul it produces both forgetfulness and foolish conduct. When he is sober, his bodily parts are buoyant and easier to move, the senses are clearer and brighter and the mind keener-sighted, so that it can foresee events and recount what it has seen in the past.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="100"><p> In general, indeed, wine

must be regarded as very unprofitable for every side of life, since it presses hard upon the soul, dulls the senses and weighs down the body, leaving none of our faculties free and untrammelled but hampering the natural activity of each. But in religious rites and ceremonies the mischief is graver in the same degree as it is more intolerable to offend against our duty to God than our duty to man. Thus it is a very proper enactment that the officiants at the sacrifice should fast from wine, “to discern and distinguish between holy and profane, clean and unclean,” lawful and unlawful.<ref target="7-157-a"/> 
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="101"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="19"/> Since a priest is a man well before he<ref target="7-157-b"/>  is

a priest and must and should feel the instinct for mating, Moses arranges for his marriage with a pure virgin whose parents and grandparents and ancestors are equally pure, highly distinguished for the excellence



<pb n="159"/>


of their conduct and lineage.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="102"><p><ref target="7-159-a"/>  For a harlot is

profane in body and soul, even if she has discarded her trade and assumed a decent and chaste demeanour, and he is forbidden even to approach her, since her old way of living was unholy. Let such a one indeed retain in other respects her civic rights as she has been at pains to purge herself from her defilements, for repentance from wrongdoing is praiseworthy. Nor let anyone else be prevented from taking her in marriage, but let her not come near to the priest. For the rights and duties of the priesthood are of a special kind, and the office demands an even tenor of blamelessness from birth to death.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="103"><p> It would be

foolish if, while the bodily scars which wounds leave behind them, marks of misfortune and not of depravity, preclude one from the priesthood, the women who have sold their personal charms not only under compulsion but sometimes by free and deliberate choice, should just because of a belated and reluctant repentance pass straight from their lovers to wedlock with the priests and exchange the stews for a lodging in holy ground. For in the souls of the repentant there remain, in spite of all, the scars and prints of their old misdeeds.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="104"><p><ref target="7-159-b"/>  It is well and admirably said in

another place,<ref target="7-159-c"/>  “Neither shall the hire of a harlot be brought into the Temple,” though the coins are not guilty in themselves but only because of the recipient and the business for which it was given her. Surely




<pb n="161"/>


one would not care to admit to partnership with the priests the women whose very money is profane and regarded as base, even though the metal and the stamp is true.
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="105"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="20"/><ref target="7-161-a"/> So strict are the regulations laid down for the

marriage of the high priest that he is not even permitted to marry a widow, whether her isolation is due to the death of her husband or divorce from him while still alive. This is laid down first in order that the holy seed may pass into pure and untrodden soil and the issue receive no admixture with another family.
Secondly, that by mating with souls entirely innocent and unperverted they<ref target="7-161-b"/>  may find it easy to mould the characters and dispositions of their wives, for the minds of virgins are easily influenced and attracted to virtue and very ready to be taught.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="106"><p> But she who has had experience of another husband

is naturally less amenable to instruction. For her soul is not one of the completely simple kind like a sheet of wax levelled to show clearly the lessons to be inscribed upon it, but rather like one roughened by the imprints already scored upon it, which resist effacement and either do not yield to the dint of other seals or, if they do, confuse them with their own indentations.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="107"><p> Let the high priest then take a virgin

who is innocent of marriage. And when I say
“virgin” I exclude not only one with whom another man has had intercourse but also one with whom any other has been declared to have an agreement of betrothal, even though her body is that of a maid intact.<ref target="7-161-c"/> 
<pb n="163"/>

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="108"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="21"/> As for the subordinate<ref target="7-163-a"/>  priests, while the

other marriage regulations are the same for them as for those who hold the highest priesthood, they are permitted to wed with immunity not only virgins but widows,<ref target="7-163-b"/>  though only such as have lost their husbands by death. This limitation is due to the desire of the law to remove animosities and feuds from the lives of the priests. While the first husband lives, quarrels might be engendered by the feminine proclivity to jealousy.<ref target="7-163-c"/>  His death carries with it the death of any hostility to the second husband.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="109"><p> As for

the distinction between priests and high priests, the view of the law was that the greater sanctity and purity required of the latter in all other matters should be extended to his choice of a partner in marriage, and therefore it forbade him to take to wife any but a maiden. But to those of the second rank it made concessions as to their relations with women and permitted them to espouse such as had had experience of other husbands.
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="110"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="22"/> Further, it made clear distinctions as to the

birth of the intended wives. The high priest must not propose marriage save to one who is not only a virgin but a priestess descended from priests<ref target="7-163-d"/>  so that bride and bridegroom may be of one house and in a sense of the same blood and so, harmoniously united, shew a lifelong blending of temperament firmly established.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="111"><p> But the rest are permitted to marry


<pb n="165"/>


the daughters of others than priests<ref target="7-165-a"/>  partly because the restrictions required to<ref target="7-165-b"/>  maintain their purity are slight, partly because the law did not wish that the nation should be denied altogether a share in the priestly clanship or be entirely excluded from it. This was the reason why he did not forbid the other priests to intermarry with the laity of the nation, for intermarriage is kinship in the second degree. Sons-in-law are sons to their fathers-in-law, and the latter are fathers to the former.
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="112"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="23"/> These and similar regulations as to marriage

are intended to promote the generation of children, but since generation is followed by dissolution, he has laid down laws for the priests dealing with deaths.<ref target="7-165-c"/>  In these he ordains that they should not incur defilement for all connected with them by friendship or kinship whatever the degree, but only for fathers and mothers, sons and daughters, brothers and maiden sisters.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="113"><p> But the high priest is precluded

from all outward mourning and surely with good reason.<ref target="7-165-d"/>  For the services of the other priests can be performed by deputy, so that if some are in mourning none of the customary rites need suffer. But no one else is allowed to perform the functions of a high priest and therefore he must always continue undefiled, never coming in contact with a corpse, so that he may be ready to offer his prayers and sacrifices at the proper time without hindrance on behalf of the nation.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="114"><p> Further, since he is dedicated to God and

has been made captain of the sacred regiment, he ought to be estranged from all the ties of birth and

not be so overcome by affection to parents or children or brothers as to neglect or postpone any one of the religious duties which it were well to perform without any delay.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="115"><p> He forbids him also either to rend his

garments for his dead, even the nearest and dearest, or to take from his head the insignia of the priesthood, or on any account to leave the sacred precincts under the pretext of mourning. Thus, showing reverence both to the place and to the personal ornaments with which he is decked, he will have his feeling of pity under control and continue throughout free from sorrow.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="116"><p> For the law desires him to be endued with

a nature higher than the merely human and to approximate to the Divine, on the border-line,<ref target="7-167-a"/>  we may truly say, between the two, that men may have a mediator through whom they may propitiate God and God a servitor to employ in extending the abundance of His boons to men.
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="117"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="24"/> These rules are followed directly by his

legislation on those who are to share in the first-fruits.<ref target="7-167-b"/> If any of the priests, he tells us, has lost the use of his eyes or hands or feet or any part of his body, or suffers from any defect, he must refrain from officiating because of the afflictions which have befallen him, but he may enjoy the privileges common to the priests because his pure lineage still remains without reproach.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="118"><p><ref target="7-167-c"/> If, however, leprous eruptions

appear upon him or he is suffering from seminal issue, the priest must not touch the holy table or any of the prizes to which his clan is entitled until in the one case the issue has ceased, in the other the leprosy is converted into a resemblance to the hue of healthy flesh.



<pb n="169"/>


</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="119"><p>Further, if a priest touches any impure object or, as

often happens, has an emission during the night, he must not during that day partake of consecrated food but bathe himself, and after sundown he should not be debarred from its use.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="120"><p> But the first-fruits must

be kept out of the hands of a dweller near the priest<ref target="7-169-a"/>  or his hired servant; the first is mentioned because board and hospitality are usually given to neighbours, and there is a danger that the consecrated meats may be profaned<ref target="7-169-b"/>  through an untimely generosity abused as a pretext for impiety. For we must not share everything with everyone, but restrict our gifts to what are suitable to the recipient. Otherwise the most excellent and valuable thing which life possesses, order, will be destroyed, vanquished by its most mischievous foe, confusion.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="121"><p> For if sailors on merchant vessels

were remunerated equally with the pilots, or oarsmen and marines on men-of-war with captains and admirals, or cavalry soldiers in armies with their commanders, or rank and file with their officers, or regimental captains with generals, or in cities litigants with judges, councillors with their chairmen, or in general private individuals with rulers, disturbances and factions would arise and the nominal equality would engender an actual inequality. For like pay for unlike worth is inequality, and inequality is the fountain of evil.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="122"><p> On the same principle the general

law against giving away the prerogatives of the priests should be extended to the neighbours also. Otherwise they will be handling the forbidden meats



<pb n="171"/>


just because they live in the vicinity. For the privilege belongs not to a dwelling-house, but to a caste.
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="123"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="25"/> In the same way no one

must bestow the sacred prerogative on a hired servant, either as his hire or in exchange for his service. For he will sometimes use the gift for improper purposes, thus profaning the rewards attached to pure lineage and the ministry of the sanctuary.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="124"><p> This is the

reason why no one at all of alien race,<ref target="7-171-a"/>  even though he be nobly born and of the original stock, without flaw either on the male or the female line, is permitted by the law to share in the sacred things, in order that the privileges may not be tainted with bastardy but remain the securely guarded possessions of the priestly order.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="125"><p> For it would be preposterous

that while the sacrifices and sacred rites and all the ceremonies of the altar are committed not to all but to the priests alone, the rewards assigned to these offices should become common property and at the service of chance comers, as though it were right to wear out the priests with toil and labour and the cares that beset them night and day and at the same time to allow their rewards to be shared by idlers.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="126"><p><ref target="7-171-b"/> But the home-bred or purchased slave, he proceeds,

should be given his share in food and drink from the first-fruits by the priest, his master. First, because the servant has no resources but his master, and that master’s estate consists of the sacred gifts of charity by which the slave must necessarily be maintained.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="127"><p> Secondly, what is sure to come to pass anyhow should

most certainly be done voluntarily. Our domestics are always with us and share our lives. They prepare


<pb n="173"/>


the ordinary food and drink and additional dishes for their masters, stand by the table and carry out the remains. Whether we wish it or not, they will even if they do not take them openly, pilfer them on the sly. Thus they are compelled perforce to steal and instead of a single indictment, if indeed it is an offence to feed off the master’s viands, a second is provided, namely, stealing, with the result that the enjoyment of the consecrated meats appears to fall to thieves instead of to those who live a blameless life, which is the height of absurdity.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="128"><p> There is a third point for

consideration. The dignity of the first-fruits will not be brought into contempt because they are shared by the servants. The fear of the master will prevent this, for by keeping them from idle habits he is able to check any light conduct on their part.<ref target="7-173-a"/> 
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="129"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="26"/> As a sequel to this he proceeds to lay down

a law full of humane feeling.<ref target="7-173-b"/>  If the daughter of a priest, he says, is widowed after marrying one who is not a priest, either by his death or divorce during his lifetime, and left without children, she should return to her father to regain the share in the first-fruits which she enjoyed as a virgin. For she is still in a sense virtually a virgin, destitute as she is of both husband and children and with no refuge except her father.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="130"><p> But if there are sons or daughters, the mother

must take her place with her children.<ref target="7-173-c"/>  For sons and daughters belong to the house of the male parent and carry with them into it the mother also.<ref target="7-173-d"/> 
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="131"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="27"/> The priests were not allotted a section of


<pb n="175"/>


territory by the law so that like the others they might reap the proceeds of the land and have abundance of their requisites therefrom. Instead, when referring to the consecrated offerings, it paid them the transcendent honour of saying that God was their inheritance.<ref target="7-175-a"/>  He is their inheritance for two reasons. One is the supreme honour conferred by sharing with God in the thank-offering rendered to Him. The other is the obligation to concern themselves only with the sacred rites, thus becoming in a sense trustees of inheritances. The prizes and guerdons which the law offers are as follows.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="132"><p><ref target="7-175-b"/> First, a maintenance

ready to hand and entailing no labour or trouble. For he commands that from all dough of wheat or other grain,<ref target="7-175-c"/>  the bakers should set apart a loaf as a first portion for the use of the priests. In this he is also thinking of the avenue to piety provided by the lesson which the law of setting apart gives to those who obey it.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="133"><p> For through being accustomed to make this offering

out of their necessary food, they will have God in indelible recollection and no greater blessing can be gained than this. As the nation is very populous, the first-fruits are necessarily also on a lavish scale, so that even the poorest of the priests has so superabundant a maintenance that he seems exceedingly




<pb n="177"/>


well-to-do.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="134"><p><ref target="7-177-a"/> Secondly, he ordains that

first-fruits should be paid of every other possession; wine from every winepress, wheat and barley from every threshing-floor, similarly oil from olives, and fruits from the other orchard-trees, so that the priests may not have merely bare necessaries, just keeping themselves alive in comparatively squalid conditions, but enjoy abundance of the luxuries of life and pass their days amid cheerful and unstinted comfort in the style which befits their position.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="135"><p> A third perquisite is the first-born

males of all land animals suitable for the use and service of men.<ref target="7-177-b"/>  These he orders to be distributed to the priests: in the case of kine and sheep and goats the actual offspring, male calves and lambs and kids, since they are “clean” for the purposes both of eating and sacrificing, and are recognized as such. For the others, horses and asses and camels and the like, compensation is to be paid without chaffering about the value.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="136"><p> All these are very numerous, for

the men of the nation are noted particularly as graziers and stock-breeders, and keep flocks and herds of goats and oxen and sheep and of every kind of animal in vast numbers.  And this is not all.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="137"><p> We

find the laws carrying the principle to a further extent by commanding that first-fruits should be paid not only from possessions of every kind but also from their own souls and bodies. For children are separable parts of their parents, or rather to speak more truly, inseparable parts, joined to them by kinship of blood, by the thoughts and memories of ancestors, invisible presences still alive among their descendants,


<pb n="179"/>


by the love-ties of the affection which unites them, by the indissoluble bonds of nature.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="138"><p><ref target="7-179-a"/>  Yet even

parents have their first-born male children consecrated as a first-fruit, a thank-offering for the blessings of parenthood realized in the present and the hopes of fruitful increase in the future. At the same time he shews his wish that the marriages, the first produce of which is a fruit sacred to His service, should be not only blameless but worthy of the highest praise. And reflection on this should lead both husbands and wives to cherish temperance and domesticity and unanimity, and by mutual sympathy shewn in word and deed to make the name of partnership a reality securely founded on truth.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="139"><p><ref target="7-179-b"/> But to

prevent the parents being separated from the children and the children from their parents, he assessed the first-fruit arising from the consecration of the first-born sons at a fixed sum of money, and ordered rich and poor to make the same contribution. He did not take into consideration either the dignity of the contributors or the good condition and beauty of the offspring, but fixed the payment at an amount which was within the power of even the very poor.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="140"><p> For

since the birth of children is an event equally common with the grandest and the meanest, he considered it just to enact that the contribution should be equal also, aiming, as I have said, as nearly as possible at a





<pb n="181"/>


sum within the means of all.
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="141"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="28"/>

<ref target="7-181-a"/> After that he assigns another considerable source of wealth to the priests when he commands everyone to give first-fruits of his revenues from corn and wine and oil, and again of the increase of their livestock levied on their flocks and herds, of sheep and oxen and goats and other animals, and how great an abundance the nation possesses of these may be judged from the magnitude of the population.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="142"><p> From

all this it is clear that the law invests the priests with the dignity and honours of royalty. Thus he commands that tribute should be given from every part of a man’s property as to a ruler, and the way in which the tribute is paid is a complete contrast to the spirit in which the cities make their payments to their potentates.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="143"><p> The cities pay under compulsion and

reluctantly and groan under the burden. They look askance at the tax-collectors as general agents of destruction. They trump up different excuses to suit the occasion, and when they discharge the appointed dues and assessments they do so without regard to the time limits allowed.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="144"><p> But our people

pay gladly and cheerfully. They anticipate the demand, abridge the time limits and think that they are not giving but receiving. And so at each of the yearly seasons they make their contributions with benediction and thankfulness, men and women alike, and with a zeal and readiness which needs no prompting and an ardour which no words can describe.
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="145"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="29"/> These are the contributions levied on the

personal possessions of every individual, but the priests have also other special incomings drawn very


<pb n="183"/>


appropriately from the sacrifices offered.<ref target="7-183-a"/> It is ordained that with every victim two gifts should be presented to the priest from two of its parts, the arm or shoulder from the right side and all the fat from the breast, the former as a symbol of strength and manliness and of all lawful operations in giving and receiving and general activity, the latter of gentle mildness applied to the spirited element.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="146"><p><ref target="7-183-b"/>  For it is

held that this element resides in the breast, since nature has appointed the chest as the most suitable place for its mansion and girded it like a soldier armed against attack with the stoutest of fenceworks called the thorax, or breastplate, which she has formed of a number of bones one upon another, strong and hard, and bound them tight with unbreakable sinews.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="147"><p> But

of animals sacrificed away from the altars as meat for private consumption, three portions are appointed to be given to the priests, the shoulder and the jaws and the maw, as it is called.<ref target="7-183-c"/>  The shoulder for the reason mentioned a little above, the jaws both as belonging to that master-limb, the head, and as a first-fruit of the uttered word which needs their movement to make possible the outflow of its stream. The jaws are shaken—and thence the derivation of their name<ref target="7-183-d"/> —when the tongue strikes upon them and then the whole vocal mechanism joins with them in producing sound.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="148"><p> The maw is an excrescence of the

belly, and it is the fate of the belly to be the manger




<pb n="185"/>


of that irrational animal, desire,<ref target="7-185-a"/>  which drenched by wine-bibbing and gluttony, is perpetually flooded with relays of food and drink administered to it, and like a sow rejoices to make its home in the mire. And therefore the place of dregs and leavings has been assigned as by far the fittest for a licentious and most unseemly animal.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="149"><p> But the opposite of desire is continence,

the acquisition of which is a task to be practised and pressed forward by every possible means as the greatest and most perfect of blessings promoting personal and public welfare alike.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="150"><p> So

then desire, profane, impure and unholy, has been expelled outside the confines of virtue and well deserved is its banishment. But let continence, that pure and stainless virtue which disregards all concerns of food and drink and claims to stand superior to the pleasures of the stomach, touch the holy altars and bring with it the appendage of the belly as a reminder that it holds in contempt gluttony and greediness and all that inflames the tendencies to lust.
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="151"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="30"/><ref target="7-185-b"/>  In addition to all the rest it ordains that

the priests who minister at the holy sacrifices should receive the hides of the whole-burnt-offerings, the number of which is incalculable, and this is no small gift, but represents a very large sum of money. From these things it is clear that the law did not provide the consecrated tribe with a single portion, like the others, but gave it, under the guise of first-fruits from every kind of sacrifice, a source of revenue of greater dignity and sanctity than that of them all put together.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="152"><p>  But that none of the


<pb n="187"/>


donors should taunt the recipients, it ordered the first-fruits
to be first brought into the temple and then taken thence by the priests.<ref target="7-187-a"/>  It was the proper course that the first-fruits should be brought as a thank-offering to God by those whose life in all its aspects is blessed by His beneficence, and then by Him, since He needs nothing at all, freely bestowed with all dignity and honour on those who serve and minister in the temple. For if the gift is felt to come not from men but from the Benefactor of all, its acceptance carries with it no sense of shame.
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="153"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="31"/> Since, then, the prospective rewards are so

great, if any of the priests who live a decent and blameless life are in need, they confront us as accusers of our disobedience to the law, even though they bring no charge. For if we obeyed the commandment and gave the first-fruits as it is ordained, they would have not only abundance of mere necessaries but a full measure of all else that the luxurious can require.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="154"><p> And on the other hand if the priestly tribe

shall in the course of the future be found to possess all the means of life in abundance, it will be strong evidence that the practice of religion is general and the law carefully observed in all respects. But the neglectfulness of some<ref target="7-187-b"/> —for it would not be safe to accuse all—has brought about the impoverishment of the consecrated class and indeed, it is true to say, of the defaulters themselves.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="155"><p> Disobedience to the

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="156"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="32"/> After bestowing these great sources of

revenue on the priests, he did not ignore those of the second rank either, namely the temple attendants. Some of these are stationed at the doors as gatekeepers at the very entrances, some within in front of the sanctuary to prevent any unlawful person from setting foot thereon, either intentionally or unintentionally. Some patrol around it turn by turn in relays by appointment night and day, keeping watch and guard at both seasons. Others sweep the porticoes and the open court, convey away the refuse and ensure cleanliness.<ref target="7-189-a"/> All these have the tithes appointed as their wages, this being the portion settled on them as temple attendants.<ref target="7-189-b"/></p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="157"><p> It should be noted

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="158"><p><ref target="7-189-d"/> He also assigned

them forty-eight cities with a frontage of land each to the depth of 2000 cubits to graze their cattle and carry on other kinds of business necessary for the service of the cities.<ref target="7-189-e"/> Of these there were six allotted, three on the near side and three on the far side of the river Jordan, as a refuge for the perpetrators of involuntary homicide.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="159"><p> For since it would be sacrilege

temples, well secured from violation through the privileged and honourable position of the inhabitants, who, if any stronger power should attempt to use force against the suppliants, would keep them safe, not with warlike preparations, but through the dignities and privileges conferred on them by the laws in virtue of the reverence attached to the priestly office.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="160"><p> But the fugitive must remain shut up within

the confines of the city to which he has come as a refuge because of the avengers waiting at the door, whose relationship to the dead makes them seek the blood of the slayer in their bitterness at the loss of their kinsman, even though the fatal act was involuntary. For strong family feeling overpowers the sense of justice which strict reason would give. But if he advances outside he must understand that his movements will entail certain destruction, for they will not be unobserved by any member of the family, and enmeshed in their nets and snares he will be a lost man.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="162"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="33"/><ref target="7-191-a"/> Of the

animals used for this purpose some are confined to the dry land and others travel in the air. The winged creatures are divided into numberless tribes, all of which he ignored except two, the pigeon and the turtle-dove,<ref target="7-191-b"/>  the pigeon because it is the gentlest of those whose nature is tame and gregarious, the dove



<pb n="193"/>


because it is the tamest of those which are naturally fond of solitude.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="163"><p> The land animals collect in vast

multitudes and the number of their varieties is almost incalculable. All these he passed over after selecting three as of superior merit, namely, oxen, sheep and goats.<ref target="7-193-a"/>  For these are the gentlest and the most docile. We see great herds and flocks of each kind led by a single person, it matters not who. He may even be not a grown man, but the merest child, and under his guidance they go out to the pasture and when required return back in order to their pens.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="164"><p> This tameness is shewn by many other indications,

but most clearly by the following facts. All of them are eaters of grass, none eat flesh; none of them have crooked talons nor a full supplement of teeth, for the upper gum does not lend itself to the growth of teeth, but all the incisors are missing there.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="165"><p> Furthermore,

in the whole animal kingdom they are the most serviceable for human life. The rams produce raiment, the indispensable shelter for the body, the ox ploughs the soil and prepares it for the seed, and when the crop is produced threshes it, thus making it into food which can be shared and enjoyed, while the skin and hair of the goat, when woven or sewn together, supply portable houses for travellers and particularly for campaigners who are compelled by the exigencies of their life to spend most of their time outside the city and in the open air.
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="166"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="34"/>

<ref target="7-193-b"/> All the animals selected must be perfect, with no affliction troubling any part of their body, scathless throughout and free from fault or flaw.<ref target="7-193-c"/> In fact, so great is the forethought exercised not only by those


<pb n="195"/>


who bring the sacrifices but also by the officiants, that the most highly approved of the priests, selected as most suitable for such inspection, examine them from the head to the extremities of the feet, both the visible parts and those which are concealed under the belly and thighs, for fear that some small blemish has passed unobserved.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="167"><p> The examination is carried

out with this excessive minuteness in consideration not of the victims offered but of the innocence of those who offer them. For the law would teach them under this symbol that when they approach the altar to offer either prayers or thanks they must come with no infirmity or ailment or evil affection in the soul, but must endeavour to have it sanctified and free throughout from defilement, that God when He beholds it may not turn away His face from the sight.
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="168"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="35"/> But since the sacrifices are of two kinds,

some offered for the whole nation, or rather, it would be correct to say, for all mankind, others for each separate individual among those whose sense of duty makes them worshippers, we must first speak of those which are general. The system on which they are arranged is admirable.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="169"><p> Some are offered

daily, others on the seventh days, others at the new moons or the beginnings of the sacred month, others at the fasts, others at the three festal seasons.<ref target="7-195-a"/> Every day two lambs are to be brought to the altar, one at dawn, the other towards dusk. Both these, are thank-offerings, one for the benefactions of the day-time, the other for those of the night, given to the human race ceaselessly and constantly by the bounty of God.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="170"><p><ref target="7-195-b"/> On the seventh days he doubles the number


<pb n="197"/>


of the victims. He makes this addition of a number equal to the original because he considers the seventh day, called also in his records the birthday of the whole world,<ref target="7-197-a"/>  to be of equal value to eternity, and therefore he purposes to assimilate the sacrifice of the seventh day to the “perpetuity” of the daily offering of lambs.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="171"><p><ref target="7-197-b"/> Twice too every day the perfume of the most fragrant

kinds of incense is exhaled within the veil at sunrise and at sunset, both before the morning and after the evening sacrifice. Thus the blood offerings serve as thanksgivings for the blood elements in ourselves<ref target="7-197-c"/>  and the incense offerings for our dominant part, the rational spirit-force within us which was shaped according to the archetypal form of the divine image.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="172"><p><ref target="7-197-d"/> <ref target="7-197-e"/> But on each seventh day loaves are

exposed on the holy table equal in number to the months of the year in two layers of six each, each layer corresponding to the equinoxes. For there are two equinoxes in each year, in spring and autumn, with intervals, the sum of which is six months. For this reason * * * At the spring equinox all the seed crops come to their fulness just when the trees begin to produce their fruit, and at the autumn equinox that same fruit is brought to maturity and it is the season when the sowing begins again. Thus nature running its agelong round alternates its gifts to the human race, symbolized by the two sets of six loaves exposed upon the table.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="173"><p> They are also emblematic

of that most profitable of virtues, continence, which

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="175"><p> On

All these things should be held in little account by those who are minded to live with God for their standard and for the service of Him that truly is—men who, trained to disregard the pleasures of the flesh and practised in the study of nature’s verities, pursue the joys and sweet comforts of the intellect.

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="178"><p> Now ten is a perfect number, and he distributed

it excellently among the above-mentioned items; two calves because the moon as she runs for ever her race forwards and backwards has two motions, one as she waxes till she becomes full, one as she wanes to her conjunction with the sun; one ram because there is one law or principle by which she waxes and wanes at equal intervals, both when her light grows and when it fails; seven lambs because the complete changes of form to which she is subject are measured in sevens.<ref target="7-201-c"/>  In the first seven from the conjunction we have the half moon, in the second the full moon, and when she is reversing her course she passes first into the half moon and then dies away into the conjunction.</p></div>

performed on behalf of the nation or, to speak more correctly, on behalf of the human race, have now been described to the best of my ability. But these burnt-offerings are accompanied on each day of a feast by the sacrifice of a kid called the sin-offering offered for the remission of sins, its flesh being put aside to be eaten by the priests.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="191"><p><ref target="7-209-b"/>  What is the reason for this 

addition? Is it that a feast is a season of joy, and the true joy in which there is no illusion is wisdom firmly established in the soul, and the wisdom that is stable cannot be acquired without applying medicine to the sin and surgery to the passions? For it would be a strange inconsistency if, while each of the victims consumed in the burnt-offering is only dedicated when found to be free from mischief and blemish, the mind of the worshipper should not be purified in every way and washed clean and fair by the ablutions and lustrations, which the right reason of nature pours into the souls of those who love God through ears that are sound in health and free from corruption.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="192"><p> But besides 

this something else may be justly said. These festal occasions of relaxation and cessation from work have often ere now opened up countless avenues to transgressions. For strong drink and gross eating accompanied by wine-bibbing, while they awaken the insatiable lusts of the belly, inflame also the lusts seated below it, and as they stream along and overflow on every side they create a torrent of evils in-numerable,


<pb n="211"/>


because they have the immunity of the feast for their headquarters and refuge from retribution.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="193"><p> All this the lawgiver observed and therefore 

did not permit his people to conduct their festivities like other nations, but first he bade them in the very hour of their joy make themselves pure by curbing the appetites for pleasure. Then he summoned them to the sanctuary to take their part in hymns and prayers and sacrifices, that the place and the spectacles there presented and the words there spoken, working through the lordliest of the senses, sight and hearing, may make them enamoured of continence and piety. Last of all by the sin-offering he warned them against continuing in sin, for he who asks for absolution of the sins he has committed is not so lost a wretch as to embark on other new offences at the very time when he asks for remission of the old.
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="194"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="36"/> After having discoursed to this extent 

on these subjects he begins to classify the kinds of sacrifices. He divides them into three principal classes which he calls respectively the whole-burnt-offering, the preservation-offering and the sin-offering. To each of these he adds the adornment of suitable ritual, in which he succeeds admirably in combining decorum with reverence.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="195"><p> His classification is quite 

excellent and perfectly fits the facts to which it shews a logical sequence. For if anyone cares to examine closely the motives which led men of the earliest times to resort to sacrifices as a medium of prayer and thanksgiving, he will find that two hold the highest place. One is the rendering of honour to God for the sake of Him only and with no other motive, a thing both necessary and excellent. The other is the signal benefit which the worshipper

<pb n="213"/>


receives, and this is twofold, on one side directed to obtaining a share in blessings, on the other to release from evils.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="196"><p> To the God-ward motive which has Him 

alone in view he assigned the whole-burnt-offering, for, whole and complete in itself as it is, it fits in well with the same qualities in the motive which carries with it no element of mortal self-interest; but where human interests were concerned, since the idea admitted of division, the lawgiver also made a division, and appointed what he called a preservation-offering to correspond to the aspiration for participation in blessings, while he assigned the sin-offering for avoidance of evils.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="197"><p> Thus very properly 

there are three offerings for three objects, the whole-burnt-offering having no other in view but God Himself alone Whom it is good to honour, the other two having ourselves in view, the preservation-offering for the safe preserving and bettering of human affairs, the sin-offering for the healing of the trespasses which the soul has committed.
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="198"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="37"/> We must now describe the ordinances 

dealing with each of these sacrifices, beginning with the best, which is the whole-burnt-offering.<ref target="7-213-a"/> First of all, he says the victim must be a male specimen of the animals selected as best for the purpose, namely, a calf or lamb or kid.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="199"><p> Secondly, the giver must wash his hands and lay them on the head of the victim, and after this one priest must take and slay it while 

another priest holds a vial below and after catching some of the blood goes all round the altar and sprinkles it thereon. The victim after being flayed must be divided into parts complete in themselves, while the belly and feet are washed, and then the whole must be given over to the sacred fire of the altar. Thus

<pb n="215"/>


the one in it has become many and the many one.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="200"><p><ref target="7-215-a"/>  These are the contents of the ordinance taken 

literally. But another meaning also is indicated of the mystical character which symbols convey; words in their plain sense are symbols of things latent and obscure.  In the first place the victim of the whole-burnt-offering is a male because the male is more complete, more dominant than the female, closer akin to causal activity, for the female is incomplete and in subjection and belongs to the category of the passive rather than the active.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="201"><p> So 

too with the two ingredients which constitute our life-principle, the rational and the irrational; the rational which belongs to mind and reason is of the masculine gender, the irrational, the province of sense, is of the feminine. Mind belongs to a genus wholly superior to sense as man is to woman; unblemished and purged, as perfect virtue purges, it is itself the most religious of sacrifices and its whole being is highly pleasing to God.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="202"><p>  In the 

laying of hands on the head of the animal we find the clearest possible type of blameless actions and of a life saddled with nothing that leads to censure but in harmony with the laws and statutes of nature.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="203"><p> For 

the law desires, first, that the mind of the worshipper should be sanctified by exercise in good and profitable thoughts and judgements; secondly, that his life should be a consistent course of the best actions, so that as he lays his hands on the victim, he can boldly and with a pure conscience speak in this wise: </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="204"><p>“These hands have taken no gift to do injustice, nor 

shared in the proceeds of plunder or overreaching, nor been soiled with innocent blood. None have


<pb n="217"/>


they maimed or wounded, no deed of outrage or violence have they wrought. They have done no service of any other kind at all which might incur arraignment or censure, but have made themselves humble ministers of things excellent and profitable, such as are held in honour in the sight of wisdom and law and wise and law-abiding men.”
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="205"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="38"/> The blood is poured in a circle round the 

altar because the circle is the most perfect of figures, and in order that no part should be left destitute of the vital oblation. For the blood may truly be called a libation of the life-principle. So, then, he teaches in this symbol that the mind, whole and complete, should, as it moves with measured tread passing circle-wise through every phase of word and intention and deed, shew its willingness to do God’s service.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="206"><p><ref target="7-217-a"/>   The direction to wash the belly and the 

feet is highly symbolical. Under the figure of the belly he signifies the lust which it is well to clean away, saturated as it is with stains and pollutions, with wine-bibbing and sottishness, a mighty force for ill, trained and drilled to work havoc in the life of men.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="207"><p> By the washing of the feet is meant that his 

steps should be no longer on earth but tread the upper air. For the soul of the lover of God does in truth leap from earth to heaven and wing its way on high, eager to take its place in the ranks and share the ordered march of sun and moon and the all-holy, all-harmonious host of the other stars, marshalled and led by the God Whose kingship none can dispute or usurp, the kingship by which everything is justly governed.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="208"><p>  The division of the animal 

into its limbs indicates either that all things are one

<pb n="219"/>


or that they come from and return to one, an alternation which is called by some Fullness and Want,<ref target="7-219-a"/>  by others a General Conflagration and Reconstruction,<ref target="7-219-b"/>  the Conflagration being the state when the supremacy of heat has prevailed over the rest, the Reconstruction when the four elements, by concession to each other, obtain equilibrium.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="209"><p> My own reflections 

lead me to think the following a more correct explanation. The soul which honours the Existent having the Existent Himself only in view, ought to honour Him not irrationally nor ignorantly, but with knowledge and reason. And when we reason about Him we recognize in Him partition and division into each of the Divine powers and excellences. For God is good, He is the maker and begetter of the universe and His providence is over what He has begotten; He is a saviour and a benefactor, and has the plenitude of all blessedness and all happiness. Each of these attributes calls for veneration and praise, both separately in itself and when ranked with its congeners.  So, too, it is with the rest.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="210"><p><ref target="7-219-c"/>  

When, my mind, thou wishest to give thanks to God for the creation of the universe, give it both for the sum of things and for its principal parts, thinking of them as the limbs of a living creature of the utmost



<pb n="221"/>


perfection. Such parts are heaven and sun and moon and the planets and fixed stars; then again earth and the living creatures or plants thereon, then the sea and rivers, whether spring-fed or winter courses, and all they contain: then the air and its phases, for winter and summer, spring and autumn, those seasons which recur annually and are so highly beneficial to our life, are different conditions in the air which changes for the preservation of sublunar things.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="211"><p> And if thou givest 

thanks for man, do not do so only for the whole genus but for its species and most essential parts, for men and women, for Greeks and barbarians, for dwellers on the mainland and those whose lot is cast in the islands. And if it is for a single person, divide the thanksgiving as reason directs, not into every tiny part of him down to the very last, but into those of primary importance, first of all into body and soul of which he is composed, then into speech and mind and sense. For thanks for each of these will by itself be not unworthy to obtain audience with God.
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="212"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="39"/> Enough has now been said on the whole 

burnt-offering. We must now consider in its turn the preservation-offering.<ref target="7-221-a"/>  In this case it is a matter of indifference whether the victim is male or female. When it has been slain these three, the fat, the lobe<ref target="7-221-b"/>  of the liver and the two kidneys, are set apart for the altar, while the rest serves as a feast to be enjoyed by the person who has offered the sacrifice.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="213"><p> But why 

these parts of the inwards are consecrated must be carefully considered, not neglecting the following point. In the course of my reflections I have often pondered deeply on this question also; what could

<pb n="223"/>


be the reason why the law, when setting apart the lobe of the liver and the kidneys and the fat as a tribute reserved from the animals sacrificed, did not include either the heart or the brains, since the dominant principle resides in one or other of them.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="214"><p><ref target="7-223-a"/>  And I 

expect the same question will present itself to not a few of those who read the holy scriptures with their understanding rather than with their eyes. If such persons after examination find a more convincing reason, they will benefit both themselves and me; if not I beg them to consider whether that which has commended itself to my mind will stand the test. It is as follows. The dominant principle is the only part of us which admits and retains folly and injustice and cowardice and the other vices, and the home of this principle is one or other of the two just mentioned, namely, the brain and the heart.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="215"><p> The holy word, 

therefore, thought good that the altar of God, by which is given absolution and complete remission of all sins and transgressions, should not be approached by the container in which mind had its lair when it came forth to tread the pathless wilds of injustice and impiety, turning away from the road which leads to virtue and noble conduct. For it would be foolish to have the sacrifices working remembrance instead of oblivion of sin. This seems to me the reason why neither of the parts which hold the pre-eminence, the brain or the heart, is brought to the altar.
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="216"><p><milestone unit="para"/>As for the parts which are actually prescribed, 

appropriate reasons can be given for the choice. The fat is the richest part and acts as a protection to the inwards, serving as a covering and a source of richness to them and benefiting them by the softness of its contact. The kidneys are chosen because of their

<pb n="225"/>


relation to the testicles and generative organs; situated beside them they give them neighbourly assistance, and co-operate in promoting the easy passage of nature’s seed unimpeded by any of the adjacent parts. For the kidneys themselves are blood-coloured receptacles in which the moist off-scouring of the excrement is secreted, and contiguous to them are the testicles which create the stream of the semen. The lobe is a sample tribute from the most important of the inwards, the liver, by which the food is converted into blood and then being sluiced into the heart, is conveyed through the veins for the conservation of the whole body.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="217"><p> For the 

orifice of the stomach being adjacent to the gullet receives the food which has been first bitten off by the teeth and afterwards masticated, and by its action prepares it for the stomach itself. This receives it from the orifice and performs the second office to which it has been appointed by nature, by turning it into juice. And from the stomach there are two pipe-shaped channels extending to the liver and draining the food into the receptacles which lie at intervals therein.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="218"><p> Now the liver has two properties: 

it acts both as a sifter and a creator of blood. As a sifter it secretes all the hard and callous stuff into the adjacent bile-vessel, while in its other capacity by means of the heat which it contains it turns the pure liquid which has been strained off into blood full of life-giving powers, then presses this blood into the heart, whence, as we have said, it is sluiced into the veins, and coursing through the whole body becomes

<pb n="227"/>


its sustenance.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="219"><p><ref target="7-227-a"/> There is another point to 

be added to these statements. The liver has been made so as to lie high<ref target="7-227-b"/>  and be exceedingly smooth, and in virtue of its smoothness it plays the part of a mirror of the utmost brightness. In consequence when the mind withdrawing from its daytime cares, with the body paralyzed in sleep and the obstruction of every sense removed, begins to turn itself about and concentrate upon the pure observation of its concepts, it looks into the liver as into a mirror where it gains a lucid view of all that mind can perceive and, while its gaze travels round the images to see whether they contain any ugly defect, it eschews all such and selects their opposites, and so, well satisfied<ref target="7-227-c"/>  with all the visions presented to it, prophesies future events through the medium of dreams.
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="220"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="40"/><ref target="7-227-d"/> Two days only are allowed for the use of the 

preservation-offering as food, and nothing is to be left over till the third day. This for several reasons. One is, that all the meats of the sacred table must be eaten without undue delay, care being taken that they should not deteriorate through lapse of time. It is the nature of stale flesh to decay rapidly, even though seasoned with spices as preservatives.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="221"><p> Another 


<pb n="229"/>


reason is, that the sacrificial meals should not be hoarded, but be free and open to all who have need, for they are now the property not of him by whom but of Him to Whom the victim has been sacrificed, He the benefactor, the bountiful, Who has made the convivial company of those who carry out the sacrifices partners of the altar whose board they share. And He bids them not think of themselves as the entertainers, for they are the stewards of the good cheer, not the hosts. The Host is He to Whom the material provided for the feast has come to belong, and this must not be stowed away out of sight, and niggardliness, the vice of the slave, preferred to kindliness, the virtue of gentle birth.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="222"><p> The final reason is, that the 

preservation-offering is in fact made in behalf of two, namely soul and body, to each of which he assigned one day for feasting on the flesh. For it was meet that an equal space of time should be appointed for those elements of our nature which are capable of being preserved, so that on the first day as we eat we obtain a reminder of the soul’s preservation, on the morrow of the body’s good health.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="223"><p> And since there 

is no third thing which, properly speaking, could be the subject of preservation, he strictly forbade the use of the oblation as food on the third day, and commanded that if anything was left over through ignorance or inadvertence, it should immediately be consumed by fire.<ref target="7-229-a"/> Even him who had tasted it and nothing more he declares to be guilty. “Poor fool,” he says to him, “thou thinkest to have sacrificed, though thou hast not done so. Sacrilegious, unholy, profane, impure, is the meat which thou hast dressed.


<pb n="231"/>


I accept it not, base glutton, who even in thy dreams hast caught no glimpse of what sacrifice means.”
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="224"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="41"/> Under the head of the preservation-offering 

is embraced what is called the praise-offering.<ref target="7-231-a"/>  The principle of this is as follows. He who has never at all met with any untoward happening, either of soul or body or things external, who lives a life of peace undisturbed by war, placed in an environment of every comfort and good fortune, free from disaster and cause of stumbling, sailing in straight course over the long sea of life amid the sunshine and calm of happy circumstances, with the breeze of prosperity ever behind the helm, has as his bounden duty to requite God his pilot, Who gives him safety untouched by disease, benefits carrying no penalty and in general good unmixed with evil—requite Him, I say, with hymns and benedictions and prayers and sacrifices and the other expressions of gratitude as religion demands. All these collected and summed up have obtained the single name of praise.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="225"><p><ref target="7-231-b"/> For the consumption 

of this sacrifice one day only is allowed, not two as in the former case of the preservation-offering, that those into whose hands benefits have fallen so readily should make repayment with readiness and without delay.
<milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="42"/> So much for these.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="226"><p> We must next examine 

the third kind of sacrifice which bears the name of sin-offering.<ref target="7-231-c"/> Here we have several divisions, both according to the persons concerned and the kinds of victims. As to persons, the high priest is distinguished



<pb n="233"/>


from the whole nation and the rulers<ref target="7-233-a"/>  as a class from the men of the common people. As to victims, they may be a male calf, a he-goat, a she-goat or ewe-lamb.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="227"><p> Another distinction made is one 

which is most essential between voluntary and involuntary sins. For those who have acknowledged their sin are changing their way for the better, and while they reproach themselves for their errors are seeking a blameless life as their new goal.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="228"><p> The sins, 

then, of the high priest and those of the whole nation are purged with an animal of the same value; in both cases it is directed that a male calf should be brought. For the sins of the ruler one of less value is ordered, though this too is a male, namely a he-goat; for the sins of the commoner, one still more inferior in kind, a female offering instead of a male, that is, a she-goat.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="229"><p> For it was proper that in matters of sacrifice the ruler 

should fare better than the commoner and the nation than the ruler, since the whole should always be superior to the part; also that the high priest should be adjudged the same precedence as the nation in their purification and supplication for forgiveness of wrongdoings from the merciful power of God. But the equality of honour which the high priest enjoys is evidently not so much on his own account as because he is the servant of the nation also, giving thanks in common for all through the holiest of prayers and the purest of sacrifices.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="230"><p> Deeply and wonderfully 

impressive is the form of command in this matter.<ref target="7-233-b"/>  “If the high priest,” it says, “sins involuntarily,” and then adds, “so that the people sin,” words which


<pb n="235"/>


almost amount to a plain statement from which we may learn that the true high priest who is not falsely so-called is immune from sin, and if ever he slips, it will be something imposed on him not because of what he does himself, but because of some lapse common to the nation. And that lapse is not incurable but admits easily of healing treatment.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="231"><p><ref target="7-235-a"/> So 

when the calf has been slaughtered he bids the priest to sprinkle some of the blood with his finger seven times over against the veil at the inner shrine, beyond the first veil, at the place where the most sacred chattels have been set, and then anoint and smear the four horns of the altar of incense, corresponding to its four sides, and pour the rest of the blood at the foot of the altar in the open air.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="232"><p> To this altar he 

is commanded to bring three things, the fat and the lobe of the liver and the two kidneys, as in the ordinance of the preservation-offering. But the skin and the flesh and all the rest of the body of the calf from head to foot, with the inwards, are to be carried outside and burnt in a clear and open space<ref target="7-235-b"/>  whither the holy ashes from the altar also are conveyed. The same rules are laid down by law in the case where the sin lies with the whole nation.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="233"><p> But if a trespass is 

committed by a ruler, he purges himself with a he-goat, as I have said; if by one of the common people, with a she-goat or a ewe-lamb. For he assigned the male animal to the ruler, the female to the commoner, while the other regulations which he made are similar for both persons, namely, that the horns of the open-air altar should be anointed with the blood, the fat and the lobe of the liver and the two kidneys offered at the altar and the rest given to the priests to eat.

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="234"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="43"/><ref target="7-237-a"/> But since sins are sometimes committed 

against men, sometimes against things sacred and holy, besides the regulations already stated for dealing with involuntary offences against men, he lays down that in the case of the holy things the purificatory propitiation should be made with a ram, the offenders having first made full compensation for the subject of the trespass with the addition of a fifth part of its proper value.
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="235"><p><milestone unit="para"/>These and similar regulations for involuntary 

offences are followed by his ordinances for such as are voluntary.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="236"><p><ref target="7-237-b"/>  “If,” he says, “a man lies about a partnership or a deposit or a robbery or as to finding the lost property of someone else, and, being suspected and put upon his oath, swears to the falsehood—if then after having apparently escaped conviction by his accusers he becomes, convicted inwardly by his conscience, his own accuser, reproaches himself for his disavowals and perjuries, makes a plain confession of the wrong he has committed and asks for pardon—then the lawgiver orders that forgiveness be 

extended to such a person on condition that he verifies his repentance not by a mere promise but by his actions, by restoring the deposit or the property which he has seized or found or in any way usurped from his neighbour, and further has paid an additional fifth as a solatium for the offence.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="237"><p> And when he has thus 

propitiated the injured person he must follow it up, says the lawgiver, by proceeding to the temple to ask for remission of his sins, taking with him as his


<pb n="239"/>


irreproachable advocate the soul-felt conviction which has saved him from a fatal disaster, allayed a deadly disease, and brought him round to complete health. For him, too, the sacrifice prescribed is a ram, as also for the offender in sacred matters.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="238"><p> For the lawgiver rated the involuntary sin in the sacred sphere as equal 

to voluntary sin in the human, though indeed this last also is perhaps a desecration, since it is supplemented by an oath sworn under dishonest conditions, though rectified by the man’s conversion to the better course.
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="239"><p><milestone unit="para"/>It must be noticed, however, that while the parts of the sin-offering laid upon the altar are the same 

as in the case of the preservation-offering, namely the lobe of the liver, the fat and the kidneys—a natural arrangement because the penitent also is preserved or saved by escape from the soul-sickness which is more grievous than any which affects the body—</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="240"><p>the conditions under which the other parts of the animal 

are appointed to serve for food are different. The difference is threefold, in the place, in the time and in the recipients.<ref target="7-239-a"/>  The place is the temple, the time one day instead of two, and the participants are priests, not those who offer the sacrifices: also they are male priests.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="241"><p><ref target="7-239-b"/>  The prohibition against carrying the flesh 

outside the temple is due to his wish that any sin which the penitent has previously committed should not be made notorious through the ill-judged judgements and unbridled tongues of malicious and acrimonious persons, and blazed abroad as a subject for


<pb n="241"/>


contumelious and censorious talk, but be confined within the sacred precincts which have also been the scene of the purification.
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="242"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="44"/> The command that 

the sacrifice should serve as a feast for the priests is due to several reasons. First, to do honour to the givers of the sacrifice, for the dignity of the guests reflects glory on their entertainers; secondly, to secure them firmly in the belief that the graciousness of God extends to those who feel remorse for their sin. For He would never have called His servitors and ministers to share the hospitality of such a table if full pardon had not been given. Thirdly, because none of the priests is permitted to perform the rites if he is not wholly sound, for the slightest blemish causes him to be thrust from office.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="243"><p><ref target="7-241-a"/>  In fact he encourages those 

who no longer tread the path of wrongdoing with the thought that their resolution to purify themselves has given them a place in the sacerdotal caste and advanced them to equal honour with the priest. For a similar reason the flesh of the sin-offering is consumed in a single day, showing that in sin we should procrastinate and be slow and dilatory in approaching it, but when the achievement of righteousness is our goal, act with speed and promptitude.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="244"><p>  The victims immolated in behalf of the high priest 

or the nation as atonement for trespassing are not dressed to serve as food but are consumed by fire on the sacred ashes, as I have said.<ref target="7-241-b"/> For there is no one superior to the high priest or the nation to act as intercessor for the sinners.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="245"><p> It is natural therefore 

that the flesh should be consumed by fire in imitation



<pb n="243"/>


of the whole-burnt-offerings to do honour to the persons concerned, not because God’s holy judgements are given by considerations of position but because the sins of the greatly virtuous and the truly sacred are such as to be regarded as acts of righteousness if done by others.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="246"><p> For as the fields where the 

soil is deep and rich, even if they are sometimes unproductive, bear more fruit than those where it is naturally thin and poor, so too we find in virtuous and God-loving persons that their unproductiveness of positive goodness is better than the fortuitous righteous actions<ref target="7-243-a"/>  of the bad whose nature does not allow them ever to act intentionally in an honest way.
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="247"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="45"/> After laying down these ordinances about 

each particular kind of sacrifice, whole-burnt-offering, preservation-offering and sin-offering, he institutes rules for another which partakes of the three, to shew the friendship and kinship which exists between them. This connecting link between them is called the Great Vow.<ref target="7-243-b"/>  I must explain why it has acquired this name.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="248"><p> 

When people have paid first-fruits of every part of their property, in wheat, barley, oil, wine and their finest orchard-fruits and also in the first-born males of their livestock, consecrated in the case of the clean species and valued at an adequate compensation in the case of the unclean, as they have no more material resources with which to give a pledge of their piety, they dedicate and consecrate themselves, thus shewing an amazing sanctification and a surpassing devotion to God. And therefore it is fitly called the Great Vow,


<pb n="245"/>


for his own self is the greatest possession which anyone has, and this self he forgoes and puts himself outside it.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="249"><p> When he has made the vow, the lawgiver 

gives him the following instructions. First, he must not take any strong drink nor anything “which he makes from the grape” nor drink any other intoxicant to the overthrow of his reason, but hold himself to be serving as priest during that time. For indeed such priests as are performing the rites have to quench their thirst with water and are forbidden intoxicants.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="250"><p> Secondly, he must not shave the hairs of his head, thus 

giving a clear symbol to the eye that he does not debase the sterling coinage of his vow. Thirdly, he must keep his body pure and undefiled to the extent of abstaining from contact with parents or brothers after death, thus letting his kindly affection and fellow-feeling with the closest and dearest yield to piety that victory which it is both honourable and profitable that it should always win.<ref target="7-245-a"/> 
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="251"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="46"/> When the final day as appointed has come, 

the law bids him bring, to release him from his vow, three animals, a he-lamb, a ewe-lamb and a ram, the first for a whole-burnt-offering, the ewe-lamb as a sin-offering, and the ram as a preservation-offering.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="252"><p> For all these find their likeness in the maker of the vow: 

the whole-burnt-offering, because he surrenders not only the other first-fruits and gifts but also his own self; the sin-offering, because he is a man, since even the perfect man, in so far as he is a created being, never escapes from sinning; the preservation-offering, because he has acknowledged and adopted the real preserver, God, as the author of his preservation


<pb n="247"/>


instead of the physicians and their faculties of healing. For the physicians are mortals ready to perish, unable to secure health even for themselves, and their faculties are not beneficial to all persons nor always to the same persons, but sometimes do great harm: there is Another who is invested with lordship over such faculties and those who exercise them.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="253"><p>  I note, and it is a very striking point, that in the three 

animals brought for the different sacrifices there is no difference of species. They are all of the same species, a ram, a he-lamb and a ewe-lamb. For the law wishes to show in this way what I mentioned a little before, that the three kinds of sacrifice are sisters of one family, because the penitent is preserved and the person preserved from the maladies of his soul repents, and both of them are pressing forward to that perfect and wholly sound frame of mind of which the whole-burnt-offering is a symbol.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="254"><p>  Another point—the votary has vowed to bring himself, 

and while it would be sacrilege that the altar should be defiled by human blood, it was quite necessary that some part of him should be sacrificially offered. The part, therefore, which his zeal prompted him to take was one which can be removed without causing either pain or mutilation. He cut off the hairs of his head, which are to the body like the superfluous branches in the vegetation of a tree,<ref target="7-247-a"/>  and gave them to the fire in which the flesh of the preservation-offering is cooked, a fitting proceeding to secure that at least some part of the votary’s self which cannot be


<pb n="249"/>


lawfully brought to the altar should be merged in and share the nature of sacrifice<ref target="7-249-a"/>  by serving as fuel to a holy flame.
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="255"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="47"/> These rules apply to the laity in common, 

but the priests also had to make offerings of first-fruits to the altar, and not suppose that the services and ministrations to which they were appointed entitled them to immunity.<ref target="7-249-b"/>  The first-fruits suitable for the priest are not taken from any animal with blood in its veins, but from the purest form of human food.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="256"><p> Fine flour constitutes their perpetual 

sacrifice, a tenth part of the sacred measure for every day, half offered in the morning and half in the evening. It is fried in oil and none of it is left over to be eaten. For it is a divine command that every sacrifice offered by a priest should be wholly consumed by fire and none of it set apart for food.
<milestone unit="para"/>We have described to the best of our ability the regulations for sacrifices and will next proceed to speak of those who offer them.
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="257"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="48"/><ref target="7-249-c"/>  The law would have such a person pure 

in body and soul, the soul purged of its passions and distempers and infirmities and every viciousness of word and deed, the body of the defilements which commonly beset it.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="258"><p> For each it devised the purification 

which befitted it. For the soul it used the animals which the worshipper is providing<ref target="7-249-d"/>  for sacrifice, for the body sprinklings and ablutions of which we will speak a little later. For precedence in speech as well as elsewhere must be given to the higher and




<pb n="251"/>


more dominant element in ourselves, the soul.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="259"><p> How 

then is the soul purified? “Note, friend,” says the lawgiver, “how perfect and utterly free from blemish is the victim which you bring selected as the best of many by the priests with all impartiality of mind and clearness of vision, the result of the continued practice which has trained them to faultless discrimination. For if you observe this with your reason rather than with your eyes you will proceed to wash away the sins and defilements with which you have besmeared your whole life, some involuntary and accidental, some due to your own free will.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="260"><p> For 

you will find that all this careful scrutiny of the animal is a symbol representing in a figure the reformation of your own conduct, for the law does not prescribe for unreasoning creatures, but for those who have mind and reason. It is anxious not that the victims should be without flaw but that those who offer them should not suffer from any corroding passion.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="261"><p><ref target="7-251-a"/>  As for the body, it purifies it 

with ablutions and sprinklings and does not allow the person to be sprinkled and washed once for all and then pass straightway within the sacred precincts, but bids him stay outside for seven days and be twice sprinkled on the third and seventh day, and after that, when he has bathed himself, it gives him full security to come within and offer his sacrifice.
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="262"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="49"/> The following regulation also shews a far-sighted 

wisdom which should be noted. In almost all other cases men used unmixed water for the sprinkling. By most people it is taken from the sea, by others from the rivers, and by others it is drawn in ewers from the wells.<ref target="7-251-b"/>  But Moses first provided ashes, the remnants of the sacred fire, obtained in a

<pb n="253"/>


manner which will be explained shortly. Some of these, he says, are to be taken and thrown into a vessel and afterwards have water poured upon them. Then the priests are to dip branches of hyssop in the mixture and sprinkle with it those who are being purged.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="263"><p> The reason for this may be aptly stated as 

follows. Moses would have those who come to serve Him that is first know themselves and of what substance these selves are made. For how should he who has no knowledge of himself be able to apprehend the power of God which is above all and transcends all?</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="264"><p> Now the substance of which our body 

consists is earth and water, and of this he reminds us in the rite of purging. For he holds that the most profitable form of purification is just this, that a man should know himself and the nature of the elements of which he is composed, ashes and water, so little worthy of esteem.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="265"><p> For if he recognizes this, he will 

straightway turn away from the insidious enemy, self-conceit, and abasing his pride become well-pleasing to God and claim the aid of His gracious power Who hates arrogance. For that is a good text<ref target="7-253-a"/>  which tells us that he who sets his hand to words and deeds of pride “provokes” not only men, but also “God,” the author of equality and all that is most excellent.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="266"><p> So 

then, whilst they are being thus sprinkled, deeply moved and roused as they are, they can almost hear the voice of the elements themselves, earth and water, say plainly to them, “We are the substance of which your body consists: we it is whom nature blended and with divine craftsmanship made into the shape of human form. Out of us you were framed when you came into being and into us you will be resolved again when you have to die. For nothing is so made

<pb n="255"/>


as to disappear into non-existence. Whence it came in the beginning, thither will it return in the end.”
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="267"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="50"/> I must now also fulfil my promise to describe 

the special qualities of these ashes. They are not merely the ashes of wood consumed by fire but also of a living creature well-suited to a rite of purification such as this.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="268"><p><ref target="7-255-a"/>  He orders a red heifer which has never 

been yoked and without blemish to be taken outside the city and there slaughtered. Then the high priest is to take of the blood and sprinkle it seven times over everything in front of the sanctuary, then burn it wholly to ashes with the skin and flesh and blood and the belly filled with its ordure. When the flame is dying down, he is to cast right into the middle these three things, cedar wood and hyssop and scarlet wool. Then if it is quite extinguished, a clean man is to collect the ashes and deposit them outside the city in a clean place.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="269"><p><ref target="7-255-b"/>  What these things symbolically 

indicate has been described in full elsewhere where we have expounded the allegory.<ref target="7-255-c"/>  So we see that they who mean to resort to the temple to take part in sacrifice must needs have their bodies made clean and bright,<ref target="7-255-d"/>  and before their bodies their souls. For the soul is queen and mistress, superior to the body in every way because a diviner nature has been allotted to it. The mind is cleansed by wisdom and the truths of wisdom’s teaching which guide its steps to the contemplation of the universe and all that is therein, and by the sacred company of the other virtues and by the practice of them shewn in noble



<pb n="257"/>


and highly praiseworthy actions.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="270"><p> He, then, who is 

adorned with these may come with boldness to the sanctuary as his true home, the best of all mansions, there to present himself as victim. But anyone whose heart is the seat of lurking covetousness and wrongful cravings should remain still and hide his face in confusion and curb the shameless madness which would rashly venture where caution is profitable. For the holy place of the truly Existent is closed ground to the unholy.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="271"><p> To such a one I would 

say, “Good sir, God does not rejoice in sacrifices even if one offer hecatombs, for all things are His possessions, yet though He possesses<ref target="7-257-a"/>  He needs none of them, but He rejoices in the will to love Him and in men that practise holiness, and from these He accepts plain meal or barley,<ref target="7-257-b"/>  and things of least price, holding them most precious rather than those of highest cost.”</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="272"><p> And indeed though the worshippers bring 

nothing else, in bringing themselves they offer the best of sacrifices, the full and truly perfect oblation of noble living,<ref target="7-257-c"/>  as they honour with hymns and thanksgivings their Benefactor and Saviour, God, sometimes with the organs of speech, sometimes without tongue or lips, when within the soul alone their minds recite the tale or utter the cry of praise. These one ear only can apprehend, the ear of God, for human hearing cannot reach to the perception of such.
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="273"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="51"/> That what I have said above is true and is the 

word not of myself but of nature is attested not only



<pb n="259"/>


by its self-evident certitude which provides clear grounds of belief to those who do not out of contentiousness cultivate disbelief, but also by the law which commanded two altars to be constructed differing in materials and situations and in the use to which they were applied.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="274"><p><ref target="7-259-a"/>  For one of these was 

built of stones picked up and left unhewn, and it was set in the open air beside the avenues to the sanctuary and was to be used for blood-offerings. The other was formed of the purest gold; it was set in the inner shrine within the first veil, not to be seen by any except such priests as were in a state of purity,<ref target="7-259-b"/>  and it was to be used for frankincense-offerings.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="275"><p> This 

clearly shews that even the least morsel of incense offered by a man of religion is more precious in the sight of God than thousands of cattle sacrificed by men of little worth. For as gold is better than casual stones and all in the inner shrine more sacred than what stands outside, so and in the same measure is the thank-offering of incense superior to that of the blood of beasts.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="276"><p> And therefore the altar of incense 

receives special honour, not only in the costliness of its material, its construction and its situation, but by taking every day the earlier place in subserving the thanksgiving which men render to God. For it is not permitted to bring the victim of the whole-burnt-offering outside until the incense has been offered



<pb n="261"/>


inside at the first glimpse of day.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="277"><p><ref target="7-261-a"/>   The 

symbolical meaning is just this and nothing else: that what is precious in the sight of God is not the number of victims immolated but the true purity of a rational spirit in him who makes the sacrifice. Can you think that if the judge whose heart is set on giving righteous judgement will not take gifts from any of the litigants, or if he does take them will be open to the charge of bribery; if again the good. man will not receive them from the bad, though both are men, and the one perhaps in need and the other rich—can you think, I say, that God can be corrupted, God Who is absolutely sufficient to Himself and needs nothing of anything created, and being as He is the primal good, the consummation of perfection, the perennial fountain of wisdom and justice and every virtue, turns His face from the gifts of the unjust?</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="278"><p> And is not he who proffers them the most shameless 

of men when he gives to God a share of the profits of his thefts or robbery or denial of a just debt or refusal to pay it, and treats Him as a partner in his wickedness and greed? To such a one I would say “Most miserable of wretches, there are only two alternatives: You expect that your conduct will either be unobserved by God or patent to Him.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="279"><p> If 

the former, you little know the power by which He sees all and hears all: if the latter, your audacity is beyond measure. When you should hide your face in shame for the sins you have committed, you make an open show of the outward signs of your iniquity and, priding yourself on them, assign a share to God. You bring Him the first-fruits of unholiness and have


<pb n="263"/>


not reflected that the law does not admit of lawlessness nor sunlight of darkness. But God is the archetype on which laws are modelled: He is the sun of the sun, in the realm of mind what that is in the realm of sense, and from invisible fountains He supplies the visible beams to the sun which our eyes behold.”
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="280"><p><milestone unit="para"/><ref target="7-263-a"/>  There is a very excellent ordinance inscribed in 

the sacred tables of the law, that the hire of a harlot should not be brought into the temple;<ref target="7-263-b"/>  the hire, that is, of one who has sold her personal charms and chosen a scandalous life for the sake of the wages of shame.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="281"><p> But if the gifts of one who has played the 

harlot are unholy, surely more unholy still are the gifts of the soul which has committed whoredom, which has thrown itself away into ignominy and the lowest depths of outrageous conduct, into wine-bibbing and gluttony, into the love of money, of reputation, of pleasure, and numberless other forms of passion and soul-sickness and vice. What length of time can purge away the stains of these? None, to my knowledge.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="282"><p> The harlots’ traffic indeed is 

often brought to a close by old age, since when the freshness of their charm is passed, all cease to seek them now that their bloom is faded like the bloom of flowers. But as for the soul, when by constant familiarity with incontinence it has been schooled into harlotry, what agelong stretch of years can convert it to decent living? Not even the longest, but only God, with Whom that is possible which is impossible with us.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="283"><p> So he who intends to sacrifice 

must consider not whether the victim is unblemished



<pb n="265"/>


but whether his own mind stands free from defect and imperfection. Further, let him examine the motives which determine him to make the offering. For either he is giving thanks for benefits already received or is asking for security in his tenure of present blessings or for acquisition of others to come, or for deliverance from evils, either present or expected, and all these demand that he should put himself into a condition of mental health and safety.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="284"><p> For if he is offering thanks for what has already been 

granted, let him not shew ingratitude by falling from the state of virtue in which he received these boons. Or if he is securing present blessings or has bright expectations for the future, let him shew himself by good conduct worthy of such happy events. Or if he is seeking to escape from some ills, let none of his actions be deserving of chastisement and punishment.

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="285"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="52"/><ref target="7-265-a"/>  The fire on the altar, he tells us, will burn 

continuously and not be extinguished.<ref target="7-265-b"/>  That, I think, is natural and fitting, for since the gracious gifts of God granted daily and nightly to men are perennial, unfailing and unceasing, the symbol of thankfulness also, the sacred flame, should be kept alight and remain unextinguished for ever.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="286"><p> Perhaps 

also he wishes in this way to employ the abiding presence of the same fire by which all the sacrifices are consecrated to unite them, old and new alike,<ref target="7-265-c"/>  and thus shew that they carry out perfectly the duty

of giving thanks, however numberless are the differences in the resources on which they are based, according as the oblations are lavishly abundant or on the other hand scanty.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="287"><p>  This is the 

literal account: the inner meaning must be observed by the laws of allegory. The true altar of God is the thankful soul of the Sage, compacted of perfect virtues unsevered<ref target="7-267-a"/>  and undivided, for no part of virtue is useless.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="288"><p> On this soul-altar the sacred light is ever

its constancy and permanence from virtue.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="291"><p> He adds, too, a further enactment by which he orders 

every sacrifice to be offered without honey or leaven.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="292"><p><ref target="7-269-a"/>  Both these substances he considers unfit to be brought to the altar: honey perhaps because the bee which collects it is an unclean animal, bred from the putrescence and corruption of dead oxen, we are told, just as wasps are from the carcasses of horses<ref target="7-269-b"/> ; or else he forbids it as a symbol of the utter unholiness 

of excessive pleasure which tastes sweet as it passes through the throat but afterwards produces bitter and persistent pains which of necessity shake and agitate the soul and make it unable to stand firmly in its place.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="293"><p> Leaven is forbidden because of the

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="297"><p>  A second 

object was, that at night-time also some rites of the same kith and kin as those of the day-time should be performed for the service of God, and that no time or season should omit its thanksgiving.

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="298"><p> There is a third 

reason, a very cogent one: Not only in our waking hours do we experience blessings, but also in our slumbers.

The body is released from the labours of the day, the soul relaxes its anxious cares and retreats into itself, away from the press and clamour of the senses, and can then, if at no other time, enjoy privacy and commune

And therefore Moses naturally banished them all from the holy congregation, both those who abolish the Forms, who appear under the name of “the crushed,” and those who absolutely deny God, to whom he assigned the suitable<ref target="7-303-a"/>  title of “the mutilated” and those who preach the opposite doctrine of a family of gods, called by him “the children of the harlot,” and finally the self-assertive, one party of whom deify the reason, the other each several sense. For these last all press to the same goal, though influenced by different plans for attaining it, and ignore the one and really existing God.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="345"><p> But we, the scholars and disciples of Moses, 

will not forgo our quest of the Existent, holding that the knowledge of Him is the consummation of happiness. It is also agelong life. The law tells us that all who “cleave to God live,”<ref target="7-303-b"/>  and herein it lays down a vital doctrine fraught with much wisdom. For in very truth the godless are dead in soul, but those who have taken service in the ranks of the God Who only is are alive, and that life can never die.</p></div></div>

<head>On the special laws which fall under three of the ten general commandments, namely the third on the duty of keeping oaths,<ref target="7-307-a"/> the fourth on reverencing the seventh day, and the fifth on honouring parents</head>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="1"><p>
<milestone unit="altchapter" n="1"/> In the preceding treatise we have dealt fully  
with two of the ten heads, one directed against the acknowledgement of other sovereign gods, the other against giving divine honours to any work of men's hands. And we have described such among the particular enactments of the law as may be properly classed under either head. Let us now discuss the three next in the list, again subjoining those of the special ordinances which belong to them. 
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="2"><p>
The first of the three forbids us to take God's name in vain: the good man's word, it means, should be =
an oath, firm, unswerving, utterly free from falsehood, securely planted on=
 truth. And if indeed occasion should force us to swear, the oath should be=
 by a father and mother, their good health and welfare if they are alive, t=
heir memory if they are dead. For parents are copies and likenesses of the =
divine power, since they have brought the non-existent into existence.

<pb n="309"/>


</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="3"><p>In the laws we read of one of our first founders,<ref target="7-309-a"/>  

who are particularly admired for their wisdom, that he swore by the fear of his father, a fact recorded, I believe, for the benefit of posterity and to teach them the necessary lesson that they should honour their parents in the proper way by showing affection to them as benefactors and awe of them as rulers appointed by nature, and should not lightly essay to use the name of God.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="4"><p> Those persons too deserve 

praise whose unwillingness, tardiness and shrinking, if they are ever forced to swear, raise qualms not only in the spectators but even in those who are administering the oath: such people are in the habit of saying “Yes, by—” or “No, by—”<ref target="7-309-b"/>  and add nothing more, and by thus breaking off suggest<ref target="7-309-c"/>  the clear sense of an oath without actually making it.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="5"><p> But 

also a person may add to his “Yes” or “No “if he wish, not indeed the highest and most venerable and primal cause, but earth, sun, stars, heaven, the whole universe.<ref target="7-309-d"/>  For these are worthy of highest respect, since they have precedence in time over our place in creation, and also will remain for ever untouched by age according to the purpose of Him Who made them.
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="6"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="2"/> But so great is the lightness 

and heedlessness shown by some that they pass by all these works of creation and allow their words to dash on to the Maker and Father of all, never staying to examine whether the place is profane or holy, whether the occasion is suitable, whether they themselves are pure in body and soul, whether the business is important or the object necessary. Instead,



<pb n="311"/>


with unwashed hands,<ref target="7-311-a"/>  as the phrase goes, they make a foul brew of everything, as though Nature’s gift of a tongue justified them in using it without restraint or bridle for unlawful purposes, </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="7"><p>whereas 

that most excellent of instruments which gives clear expression to voice and words, those great benefactors of human life and creators<ref target="7-311-b"/>  of a sense of fellowship, should have been employed to the full by them to ascribe honour and majesty and blessedness to the Cause Which has created all things.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="8"><p> As it is, so 

highly impious are they that on any chance matter the most tremendous titles are on their lips and they do not blush to use name after name, one piled upon another, thinking that the continual repetition of a string of oaths will secure them their object. A very foolish delusion. For in the eyes of sensible people much swearing is a proof, not of good faith, but of faithlessness.
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="9"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="3"/> But if anyone has been absolutely compelled 

to swear on any matter whatever, so long as it is not forbidden by the law, he should use all his strength and every means in his power to make good his oath, and allow nothing to hinder him from carrying out his decision, particularly when he has taken the oath in a reasonable and sober frame of mind, not distraught by savage tempers or frenzied yearnings or uncontrollable desires, so that he does not know what he says or does.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="10"><p> For what is better than to practise 

a lifelong veracity, and to have God as our witness thereto?<ref target="7-311-c"/>  For an oath is nothing else than to call


<pb n="313"/>


God to bear witness in a disputed matter, but to call God to witness to a falsehood is the very height of profanity.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="11"><p> To do so is practically to say outright, 

even though one appear not to utter a word, “I take Thee as a cloak for my wrongdoing. I am ashamed to appear a sinner, be Thou my accomplice; take the charge of my villainy upon Thyself instead of me. For it is a matter of weight to me in my wickedness not to be thought a rogue, but Thou carest not for the opinion of the multitude and troublest not that men should speak well of Thee.” Such words or thoughts are impious in the extreme. To hear them would rouse the indignation, not only of God, Who is exempt from all wickedness, but also of a father or even a stranger who knew anything at all of the flavour of virtue.
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="12"><p><milestone unit="para"/>So then, as I have said, all oaths must be made good 

so long as they are concerned with matters honourable and profitable for the better conduct of public or private affairs and are subject to the guidance of wisdom and justice and righteousness,
<milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="4"/> under which head come also the perfectly lawful vows made in acknowledgement of an abundant measure of blessings either present or expected. But when the oaths have objects of the opposite kind in view, religion forbids us to put them into execution.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="13"><p> For 

there are some who swear at random<ref target="7-313-a"/>  to commit acts of theft and sacrilege or rape and adultery or assaults and murders or other similar crimes and carry them out without hesitation on the pretext that they must be faithful to their oaths, as though it were not better and more pleasing to God to abstain from wrong-


<pb n="315"/>


doing than to abstain from breaking their oaths. Justice and every virtue are commanded by the law of our ancestors and by a statute established of old, and what else are laws and statutes but the sacred words of Nature, possessing intrinsically a fixity and stability which makes them equivalent to oaths?</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="14"><p> And everyone who commits a wrong because he has 

sworn to do so may be assured that the act is not one of faithfulness to a pledge but breaks the oath so worthy of all careful observance with which she sets her seal<ref target="7-315-a"/>  on what is just and excellent. For he adds guilt to guilt when oaths taken for improper purposes which had better have been left unspoken are followed by actions which violate the law.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="15"><p> Let him 

abstain, then, from wrongful conduct and supplicate God, that He may grant him a share of what His gracious power can give and pardon him for what he has sworn so unadvisedly. For to choose a double measure of ill when he could disburden himself of the half of it is the act of one almost hopelessly imbecile and insane.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="16"><p>  But there are some who, either 

because through excessive moroseness their nature has lost the sense of companionship and fellow-feeling or because they are constrained by anger which rules them like a stern mistress, confirm the savagery of their temper with an oath. They declare that they will not admit such and such a person to their board or under their roof, or again, that they will not render assistance to so and so or accept anything from him till his life’s end. Sometimes they carry on their vindictiveness after that end has come and leave


<pb n="317"/>


directions in their wills<ref target="7-317-a"/>  against even granting the customary rites to his corpse.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="17"><p> To such persons I 

would give the advice which I gave to the former class, that they should propitiate God with prayers and sacrifices to win from Him what their needs demand, namely, the healing treatment of their spiritual distempers which no human power is competent to cure.
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="18"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="5"/> But there are others, boastful persons,<ref target="7-317-b"/>  of the 

sort that is puffed up by arrogance, who in their craving for high position determine to have nothing to do in any way with the frugal, the truly profitable mode of living. Indeed, if any rebuke them in order to rein in the unruliness of their desires, they regard the admonition as an insult, and as they press forward to a career of luxury disregard their correctors and hold the admirable and also highly valuable instructions of wisdom a matter for laughter and mockery.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="19"><p> And if they happen to have some abundance 

of resources and means of living on a lavish scale, they employ oaths to set the seal on their use and enjoyment of the wealth which enables them to spend so freely. Here is an instance of what I mean. A short time ago a man of considerable property who had found a loose and dissipated style of living to his taste, was in the presence of an elderly person, a relation or old family friend, I believe, who was reproving him and advising him to make a change and conduct himself with more strictness and seriousness. The other strongly resented this reproof and countered the challenge by swearing that so long as


<pb n="319"/>


he possessed his incomings and goods in stock he would take no step in the direction of economy, either in town or country, either on shipboard or on the road, but would make display of his wealth always and everywhere. But this is evidently not so much an exhibition of wealth as of arrogance and intemperance.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="20"><p>  And yet to this day 

among those who hold high offices of authority there are not a few who possessing accumulated goods in vast numbers and abundant resources, to whom wealth is ceaselessly flowing in as from a perennial fountain, still sometimes betake themselves to the use of such things as we poor people use.<ref target="7-319-a"/>  Their cups are earthern, their loaves spit-baked, their extra dishes olives or cheese or greens: in the summer they wear a girdle and a thin shirt and in the winter a stout rent-proof mantle. The floor will sometimes serve for their bedstead: they have nothing to say to beds of ivory-work or made of tortoiseshell and gold, or bedding brocaded with flowers and purple-dyed garments and elaborate honey-cakes and tables spread with costly luxuries.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="21"><p> The reason, I take it, is not only that they are blessed 

with a fine nature, but also that they have been brought under the influence of a right training from their earliest years. That training has taught them to value the interests of the man before those of the ruler. It makes its abode in their souls, and hardly a day passes but it reminds it of their common humanity and draws them away from lofty and overweening thought, reduces their swollen dimensions, and medicines their inequality with equality.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="22"><p> And 

therefore they have filled their cities with plenty and abundance, with order and peace; of no good thing

<pb n="321"/>


have they mulcted them, all good things have they bestowed freely, unsparingly and unstintedly. These and the like are the actions of noble men, rulers in the true sense.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="23"><p>  Far different are the 

actions of the newly rich who have been wafted into opulence by a freak of fortune. They know nothing, have never even dreamt, of the true wealth which has eyes to see,<ref target="7-321-a"/>  whose substance is the perfect virtues and the actions which conform with them; it is a blind wealth against which they have struck<ref target="7-321-b"/>  and taking it for their support they fail of necessity to see the road before them and wander away into pathless wilds, admiring what deserves no serious respect and mocking at what nature would bid them honour. Such persons, when they take a mistimed oath, are rebuked and reproached in no gentle terms by the holy word. Hardly can they be purged and healed, so that even the gracious nature of God deems them unworthy of His pardon.
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="24"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="6"/><ref target="7-321-c"/> Virgins and wives are not allowed full control 

of their vows by the law. It puts the virgins in subjection to their fathers and sets the husbands to judge for their wives whether the oaths are to hold good or to be cancelled. That is surely reasonable, for the former, owing to their youth, do not know the value of oaths, so that they need others to judge for them, and the latter often, through want of sense, swear what would not be to their husbands’ advantage; and therefore it gave the husbands power to maintain the promise, or the reverse.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="25"><p><ref target="7-321-d"/> Widows who have none 

to intervene on their behalf, neither husbands from




<pb n="323"/>


whom they have been parted, nor fathers whom they left behind them when they set out to find a new home in marriage, should be slow to swear, for their oaths stand beyond repeal, the inevitable result of their lack of protectors.
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="26"><p><milestone unit="para"/><ref target="7-323-a"/> If anyone knows that another has perjured himself, 

and influenced by friendship or shame or fear rather than piety, fails to inform against him or bring him to justice, he must be liable to the same penalties as the perjurer. For to range oneself on the side of the wrongdoer is just the same as committing the wrong.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="27"><p> As to the penalties of perjury, some proceed 

from God, others from man. The highest and greatest are from God, Who is not gentle to such impiety, but suffers the guilty to remain for ever in their well-nigh hopeless uncleanness, a just and fitting penalty, I hold.<ref target="7-323-b"/>  For he who has ignored God, how can he wonder if he is ignored in his turn and is repaid in his own coin?</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="28"><p> The penalties given by men are different, 

death or the lash.<ref target="7-323-c"/>  The better kind whose piety is extra-fervent maintain the penalty of death, while those whose feelings of indignation are not so stern have the offenders scourged by order of the State in a public place and in the sight of all. Indeed except to persons of a servile nature, a flogging is as severe a penalty as death.
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="29"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="7"/> Such is the sum and substance of these ordinances<ref target="7-323-d"/>  

taken literally. But we may also allegorize



<pb n="325"/>


such parts of the subject as admit of being studied in a figurative sense. We should know, then, that nature’s right reasoning has the functions both of a father and a husband, though the conceptions attached to each are different. It acts as a husband because it deposits the seed of virtue in the soul as in a fertile field. It acts as a father because its nature is to beget good intentions and noble and worthy actions, and then to foster its offspring with the water of the truths which education and wisdom abundantly supply.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="30"><p> The mind is likened on the one hand to a 

virgin, on the other to a woman either in widowhood, or still united to a husband. As a virgin it keeps itself pure and uncorrupted from the malignant passions, pleasures and desires and griefs and fears. Over this virgin mind the father who begat it has assumed authority. But when, like a wife, it dwells with virtuous reasoning as its worthy mate, that same reasoning promises to take charge of it and impregnates it husband-like with thoughts of highest excellence.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="31"><p> But the soul, which is bereaved of 

its birth-tie with sound sense or its marriage-tie with right reasoning, is widowed of all that is most excellent and, deserted by wisdom because it has chosen a life of guilt, must stand bound by the decision which it has made to its own undoing. It has none to heal its errors, no reasoning of wisdom, either to live with it as its husband or to act as its father and begetter.
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="32"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="8"/><ref target="7-325-a"/> In dealing with those who have dedicated 

votive offerings, not only of their property or parts of it, but of themselves, the law laid down a scale of valuation in which no regard is paid to beauty or stature or anything of the kind, but all are assessed

<pb n="327"/>


equally, the sole distinctions made being between men and women and between children and adults.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="33"><p> It ordained that from 20 years to 60 a man should be 

valued at 200<ref target="7-327-a"/>  drachmas of pure silver coinage and a woman at 120; from 5 to 20 years, a male at 80 and a woman at 40 drachmas; from infancy to 5 years, a male at 20 and a female at 12 drachmas, while in the case of old persons who have lived beyond 60, the men are valued at 60 drachmas and the women at 40.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="34"><p> The order that all males and all females should be 

assessed equally<ref target="7-327-b"/>  at every age was made for three most cogent reasons. First, because the worth of one person’s vow is equal and similar to that of another, whether it is made by a person of great importance or one of mean estate; secondly, because it was not seemly that the votaries should be subject to the vicissitudes of slaves who are valued at a high price or on the other hand are rated low accordingly as they have or have not a fine condition of body and comeliness; thirdly, and this is the most convincing of all, that in the sight of men inequality, in the sight of God equality, is held in honour.
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="35"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="9"/> These are the regulations laid down by the law 

in the case of human beings.<ref target="7-327-c"/>  For livestock we have the following. If a man sets apart a beast from his stock, if it is a clean specimen of one of the three kinds which are allowed for sacrifice, an ox or sheep or goat, he must sacrifice that particular animal without substituting either a better for a worse or a worse for a better. For God does not delight in the




<pb n="329"/>


fleshiness or fatness of animals, but in the blameless intention of the votary. But if he does make any exchange, he must consecrate two instead of one, both the original and its substitute.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="36"><p> If he has vowed any 

of his unclean cattle, he must bring it to the most highly esteemed of the priests,<ref target="7-329-a"/>  who must assess it not exceeding its proper value and then add a fifth part of that value, so that if a clean animal has to be provided for the sacrifice instead of this one, what is provided may not fall short of the proper value.<ref target="7-329-b"/>  Further, the intention is to discomfit the votary for having made a vow without reflection under the impression that the impure animal was on this occasion pure, a mistake presumably due to some mental aberration which powerfully affected him.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="37"><p><ref target="7-329-c"/>  If he 

dedicates his house, again he should take a priest as assessor, but the sums to be disbursed by the purchasers vary.<ref target="7-329-d"/> If the votary determines to redeem the house, he must spend more freely and add a fifth as a punishment for two bad things, thoughtlessness and lust of possession, the former shown in the matter of his vow, the latter in his desire to regain what he had surrendered. If the purchaser is other than the original owner, he should not pay more than the proper value.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="38"><p> The votary must not interpose long 

delay in accomplishing his vow.<ref target="7-329-e"/>  It would be a strange inconsistency if while in our dealings with



<pb n="331"/>


men we try to antedate fulfilment of our promises, in dealing with God, Who lacks and needs nothing, we should extend it beyond the appointed time. By such slowness and procrastination we convict ourselves of the greatest of iniquities, contempt of Him whose service we must hold to be the beginning and consummation of happiness. This is enough on this subject of oaths and vows.
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="39"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="10"/><ref target="7-331-a"/> The next head is concerned with the sacred 

seventh day. Under this head are included a great number of matters of vital importance, the different kinds of feasts; the release in the seventh year of persons who were naturally free but through times of adversity are in servitude; the charity shown by creditors to debtors in cancelling loans to their fellow-nationals, this also in the seventh year; the rest allowed both in the lowlands and the uplands to the fertile soil at intervals of six years; and the laws laid down with respect to the fiftieth year. The mere recital of all these is enough to make the naturally gifted perfect in virtue without any effort on their part and to produce some degree of obedience in the rebellious and hard-natured.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="40"><p>  Now the

ten. Also we have shewn how a sevenfold addition of successive numbers beginning with unity produces twenty-eight,<ref target="7-333-a"/>  a perfect number, equal to the sum of its factors; again, how when brought into a geometrical progression, it produces simultaneously a square and a cube,<ref target="7-333-b"/>  besides the numberless other beautiful results which the study of it reveals. On these numerical points we must not linger at the present juncture, but we must examine each specific subject which lies before us included under the general head, beginning with the first; and the first subject, as we saw, is the feasts.
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="41"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="11"/> There are in all ten feasts which are recorded 

in the law. The first, the mention of which may perhaps cause some surprise, is the feast of every day. The second is that held on the seventh day with six days between, called by the Hebrews in their native tongue Sabbath. The third is the new moon which follows the conjunction of the moon with the sun. The fourth is the “Crossing” festival called Pascha. The fifth is the offering of the first ears, the sacred Sheaf. The sixth is the Unleavened Bread. Then comes what is emphatically<ref target="7-333-c"/>  a seventh, being the feast of Sevens or Weeks. Eighth is the Sacred-month-day, ninth is the Fast, tenth the feast of Tabernacles which concludes the yearly festivals and thus ends up with a perfect number ten. We must begin with the first of these.
</p></div>

<pb n="335"/>


festival,<ref target="7-335-a"/>  it accommodates itself to the blameless life of righteous men<ref target="7-335-b"/>  who follow nature and her ordinances. And if only the vices had not conquered and dominated the thoughts in us which seek the truly profitable and dislodged them from each soul—if instead the forces of the virtues had remained un-vanquished throughout, the time from birth to death would be one continuous feast, and houses and cities dwelling in security and leisure<ref target="7-335-c"/>  would have been full of all good things with everything tranquil around them.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="43"><p> As it is, the overreaching and the assaults

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="44"><p> All who practise wisdom, 

either in Grecian or barbarian lands, and live a blameless and irreproachable life, choosing neither to inflict nor retaliate injustice, avoid the gathering of busy-bodies and abjure the scenes which they haunt, such as law-courts, council-chambers, markets, congregations and in general any gathering or assemblage of careless men.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="45"><p> Their own aspirations are for a life 

of peace, free from warring. They are the closest observers of nature and all that it contains; earth, sea, air and heaven and the various forms of being

which inhabit them are food for their research, as in mind and thought they share the ranging of the moon and sun and the ordered march of the other stars fixed and planetary. While their bodies are firmly planted on the land they provide their souls with wings, so that they may traverse the upper air and gain full contemplation of the powers which dwell there, as behoves true “cosmopolitans” who have recognized the world to be a city having for its citizens the associates of wisdom, registered as such by virtue to whom is entrusted the headship of the universal commonwealth.
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="46"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="13"/> Such men filled with high 

worthiness, inured to disregard ills of the body or of external things, schooled to hold things indifferent as indeed indifferent,<ref target="7-337-a"/>  armed against the pleasures and lusts, ever eager to take their stand superior to the passions in general, trained to use every effort to overthrow the formidable menace which those passions have built up against them, never swerving under the blows of fortune because they have calculated beforehand the force of its assaults, since the heaviest adversities are lightened by anticipation,<ref target="7-337-b"/>  when the mind ceases to find anything strange in the event and apprehends it but dully as it might some stale and familiar story—such men, we say, in the delight of their virtues, naturally make their whole life a feast.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="47"><p> These are indeed but a small number

nature intended them to be, all of them blameless and guiltless and lovers of sound sense, rejoicing in moral excellence just because it is what it is and counting it the only true good and all the other goods but slaves and vassals, subject to their authority, the cities would have been brimful of happiness, utterly free from all that causes grief and fears, and packed with what produces joys and states of well-being, so that each season as it comes would give full opportunity for cheerful living and the whole cycle of the year would be a feast.
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="49"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="14"/> And therefore 

in the judgement of truth none of the wicked keeps a feast, even for the shortest time, tormented as he is by consciousness of wrongdoing and depressed in soul, even though he simulates a smile with his face. For where does the wicked man find a season for true rejoicing? He whose every plan is for evil, whose life-mate is folly, with whom everything, tongue, belly and organs of generation, is against what is seasonable.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="50"><p> For with the first he blurts out 

matters of secrecy which call for silence, while in his greed he fills the second with viands unlimited and strong drink in great quantities, and as for the third, he misuses them for abominable lusts and forms of intercourse forbidden by all laws. He not only attacks in his fury the marriage-beds of others, but even plays the pederast and forces the male type of nature to debase and convert itself into the feminine form, just to indulge a polluted and accursed passion.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="51"><p> For this reason Moses, great here as ever, seeing how 

vast was the beauty which belonged to the true feast, held that its perfection was beyond the capacity of human nature to realize, and consecrated it to God with these very words, “The Lord’s feasts.” For

<pb n="341"/>


when he considered the sorrowful and terror-stricken condition of our race, how charged it is with numberless evils generated by the greedy desires of the soul and also by the infirmities of the body, increased by the vicissitudes of fortune and the mutual onslaughts of neighbours against neighbours<ref target="7-341-a"/>  who inflict and suffer countless wrongs, he could not but wonder that anyone, tossed about on so vast a sea of events, whether of his own intending or not, and unable to find tranquility or the secure anchorage of a life kept safe from danger, could really hold a feast, not in the sense in which the word is commonly used, but in the true sense; and the true sense is, to find delight and festivity in the contemplation of the world and its contents and in following nature and in bringing words into harmony with deeds and deeds with words.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="53"><p> And therefore it was 

a necessary pronouncement that the feasts belonged to God alone, for God alone is happy and blessed, exempt from all evil, filled with perfect forms of good, or rather, if the real truth be told, Himself <hi rend="italic">the</hi> good, Who showers the particular goods on heaven and earth.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="54"><p>  And so it was that in the days of old 

a certain mind of rich intelligence, her passions now calmed within her, smiled because joy lay within her and filled her womb.<ref target="7-341-b"/>  And when, as she considered the matter, it seemed to her that joy might well be the peculiar property of God alone, and that she herself was sinning in taking for her own conditions of well-being above human capacity, she was afraid, and denied the laughter of her soul


<pb n="343"/>


until her doubts were set at rest.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="55"><p> For the gracious 

God allayed her fears by an oracle in which He bade her acknowledge that she laughed, meaning thus to teach us the lesson that joy is not altogether denied to the creature. Joy is of two kinds. One is unmixed and of the utmost purity, admitting nothing whatever of the nature opposite to its own. This joy belongs to God and to no other. The other which flows from it is a mixed stream blended with lesser tributaries of sorrow, and if the blend is such that the pleasant ingredients outnumber the unpleasant, the wise man receives it as the greatest of gifts. So much for this matter.
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="56"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="15"/> After this continuous unbroken feast which 

has neither beginning nor end, the second to be observed is the sacred seventh day, recurring with six days between. Some have given to it the name of virgin,<ref target="7-343-a"/>  having before their eyes its surpassing chastity. They also call her the motherless,<ref target="7-343-a"/>  begotten by the father of the universe alone, the ideal form of the male sex with nothing of the female. It is the manliest and doughtiest of numbers, well gifted by nature for sovereignty and leadership. Some give it the name of the “season”<ref target="7-343-b"/>  judging its conceptual nature from its manifestation in the realm of sense.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="57"><p> For seven is a factor common to all the 

phenomena which stand highest in the world of sensible things and serve to consummate in due order transitions of the year and recurring seasons. Such are the seven planets, the Great Bear, the Pleiades and the cycles of the moon, as it waxes and wanes,


<pb n="345"/>


and the movements, harmonious and grand beyond description, of the other heavenly bodies.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="58"><p> But 

Moses from a higher point of view gave it the name of completion and full perfection when he laid down six as the number under which the parts of the universe were brought into being, seven as that under which they were perfected. For six is even-odd, formed out of twice three with the odd part as its male element and the even as its feminine, and these two, by the immutable laws of nature, are the sources of generation.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="59"><p> But seven is a number entirely 

uncompounded, and may be quite properly described as the light of six. For seven reveals as completed what six has produced, and therefore it may be quite rightly entitled the birthday of the world,<ref target="7-345-a"/>  whereon the Father’s perfect work, compounded of perfect parts, was revealed as what it was.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="60"><p>  On this day we are commanded 

to abstain from all work, not because the law inculcates slackness; on the contrary it always inures men to endure hardship and incites them to labour, and spurns those who would idle their time away, and accordingly is plain in its directions to work the full six days. Its object is rather to give men relaxation from continuous and unending toil and by refreshing their bodies with a regularly calculated system of remissions, to send them out renewed to their old activities. For a breathing-space enables not merely ordinary people but athletes also to collect their strength and with a stronger force behind them to undertake promptly and patiently each of the tasks set before them.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="61"><p> Further, when He forbids bodily labour 

on the seventh day, He permits the exercise of

<pb n="347"/>


the higher activities, namely, those employed in the study of the principles of virtue’s lore. For the law bids us take the time for studying philosophy and thereby improve the soul and the dominant mind.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="62"><p> So each seventh day there stand wide open 

in every city thousands of schools of good sense, temperance, courage, justice and the other virtues in which the scholars sit in order quietly with ears alert and with full attention, so much do they thirst for the draught which the teacher’s words supply, while one of special experience rises and sets forth what is the best and sure to be profitable and will make the whole of life grow to something better.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="63"><p> But among the vast number of particular truths and 

principles there studied, there stand out practically<ref target="7-347-a"/>  high above the others two main heads: one of duty to God as shewn by piety and holiness, one of duty to men as shewn by humanity and justice, each of them splitting up into multiform branches, all highly laudable.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="64"><p> These things shew clearly that Moses 

does not allow any of those who use his sacred instruction to remain inactive at any season. But since we consist of body and soul, he assigned to the body its proper tasks and similarly to the soul what falls to its share, and his earnest desire was, that the two should be waiting to relieve each other. Thus while the body is working, the soul enjoys a respite, but when the body takes its rest, the soul resumes its work, and thus the best forms of life, the theoretical and the practical, take their turn in replacing each other. The practical life has six as


<pb n="349"/>


its number allotted for ministering to the body. The theoretical has seven for knowledge and perfection of the mind.
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="65"><p><milestone unit="para"/>XVI It is forbidden to light any fire on this day,<ref target="7-349-a"/>  

fire being regarded as the source and origin of life, since without it nothing can be executed which serves the requirements necessary for existence. And thus the prohibition of the highest<ref target="7-349-b"/>  and earliest instrument needed in the arts, and especially those of the mechanical kind, acts as a barrier to those required for the particular forms of service.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="66"><p><ref target="7-349-c"/>  But it would 

seem that his further enactments were given for the sake of the more disobedient who refused to pay attention to his commandments, when he not only requires the free men to abstain from work on the Sabbath, but gives the same permission to men-servants and handmaids, and sends them a message of security and almost of freedom after every six days, to teach both masters and men an admirable lesson.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="67"><p> The masters must be accustomed to work 

themselves without waiting for the offices and attentions of their menials,<ref target="7-349-d"/>  and so in the event of times of difficulty such as occur through the vicissitudes of human affairs, they may not through unfamiliarity with personal service lose heart at the outset and despair of accomplishing the tasks set before them, but use the different parts of their body with more nimbleness and shew a robust and


<pb n="351"/>


easy activity; while on the other hand the servants are not to refuse to entertain still higher hopes, but should find in the relaxation allowed after six days an ember or spark of freedom, and look forward to their complete liberation if they continue to serve well and loyally.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="68"><p> But the result of this occasional 

submission of the free to do the menial offices of the slave, together with the immunity allowed to the slave, will be a step forward in human conduct towards the perfection of virtue, when both the seemingly distinguished and the meaner sort remember equality and repay to each other the debt incumbent on them.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="69"><p>  But the holiday of 

the Sabbath is given by the law not only to servants but also to the cattle, though there might well be a distinction. For servants are free by nature, no man being naturally a slave,<ref target="7-351-a"/>  but the unreasoning animals are intended to be ready for the use and service of men and therefore rank as slaves. Yet all the same, though it is their proper business to carry burdens and undergo toils and labour for their owners, they obtain their respite on the seventh days.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="70"><p> There is 

no need to go through the rest of the list, when even the ox<ref target="7-351-b"/>  who serves the most useful and indispensable purposes in human life, namely ploughing when the soil is prepared for the sowing, and again thrashing when the sheaves are brought in for the purging of the fruit, is then kept free from the yoke and enjoys the birthday festival of the world. So universally has the sanctity of the day extended its influence.
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="71"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="17"/> So high is the reverence which he assigns 


<pb n="353"/>


to the seventh day that other things which share in the qualities of the number are honoured in his estimation. Thus he lays down a rule for cancellation of debts in every seventh year,<ref target="7-353-a"/>  both as a succour to the poor and as a challenge to the rich to shew humanity, in order that by giving some share of their own to the needy they may expect to receive the same kindness themselves, if any disaster befall them. Human vicissitudes are manifold, and life is not always on the same anchorage, but is like an unsteady wind, ever veering round to the opposite quarter.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="72"><p> Now the best course would be that the creditors’ 

liberality should be extended to all debtors. But since they are not all capable of showing magnanimity, some being under the dominion of their money<ref target="7-353-b"/>  or not very well off, he laid down that they too should make a contribution, the sacrifice of which would not give them pain.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="73"><p><ref target="7-353-c"/>  He does not allow them to 

exact money from their fellow-nationals, but does permit the recovery of dues from the others.<ref target="7-353-d"/>  He distinguishes the two by calling the first by the appropriate name of brethren, suggesting that none should grudge to give of his own to those whom nature has made his brothers and fellow-heirs. Those who are not of the same nation he describes as aliens<ref target="7-353-e"/>  reasonably enough, and the condition of the alien excludes any idea of partnership, unless indeed by a transcendency of virtues he converts even it into a tie of kinship, since it is a general truth that common citizenship rests on virtues and laws which propound the morally beautiful as the sole good.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="74"><p><ref target="7-353-f"/>   Now lending 


<pb n="355"/>


money on interest is a blameworthy action,<ref target="7-355-a"/>  for a person who borrows is not living on a superabundance of means, but is obviously in need, and since he is compelled to pay the interest as well as the capital, he must necessarily be in the utmost straits. And while he thinks he is being benefited by the loan, he is actually like senseless animals suffering further damage from the bait which is set before him.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="75"><p> I ask you, Sir Moneylender, why do you 

disguise your want of a partner’s feeling by pretending to act as a partner? Why do you assume outwardly a kindly and charitable appearance but display in your actions inhumanity and a savage brutality, exacting more than you lend, sometimes double, reducing the pauper to further depths of poverty?</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="76"><p> And therefore no one sympathizes when 

in your eagerness for larger gains you lose your capital as well. In their glee all call you extortioner and money-grubber and other similar terms, you who have lain in wait for the misfortunes of others, and regarded their ill-luck as your own good luck.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="77"><p> It has 

been said<ref target="7-355-b"/>  that vice has no sense of sight; so too the moneylender is blind, and has no vision of the time of repayment, when it will hardly be possible, if at all, to obtain what he has expected to gain by his greed.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="78"><p> Such a person may well pay the penalty 

of his avarice by receiving back merely what he provided, and learn not to make a trade of other people’s misfortunes<ref target="7-355-c"/>  and enrich himself in improper ways. And the borrowers should be granted the privilege


<pb n="357"/>


of the law’s charity, and pay neither simple nor compound interest, but just the principal. For later, as the proper occasion arise, they will make the same sacrifice to their present creditors and requite with equal assistance those who were the first to bestow the benefit.
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="79"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="18"/> After ordinances of this sort he follows 

them by laying down a law which breathes kindness and humanity throughout.<ref target="7-357-a"/>  “If,” he says, “one of your brethren is sold to you, let him continue in slavery for six years but in the seventh be set free without payment.”</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="80"><p> Here again he uses the term 

brother of a fellow-national, and by this name indirectly sows in the soul of the owner the thoughts of his close relationship to the person in his power. It bids him not despise him as a stranger who has no charm to win his affection, but allow the lesson which the holy word suggests<ref target="7-357-b"/>  to create a preliminary sense of kinship, and thus feel no resentment at his approaching liberation.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="81"><p> For people in this position, 

though we find them called slaves, are in reality labourers<ref target="7-357-c"/>  who undertake the service just to procure themselves the necessaries of life, however much some may bluster about the rights of absolute power which they exercise over them.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="82"><p><ref target="7-357-d"/>  We must abate 

their truculence by repeating these excellent injunctions of the law. The man whom you call a slave, my friend, is a hired person, himself too a man, ultimately<ref target="7-357-e"/>  your kinsman, further of the same



<pb n="359"/>


nation, perhaps also of the same tribe and ward,<ref target="7-359-a"/>  reduced to the guise which he now adopts by actual need.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="83"><p> Expel, then, from your soul that evil and 

malignant thing, arrogance. Deal with him as your hired servant, both in what you give and what you take. As for the latter, he will render you his services without the slightest backwardness always and everywhere without procrastination, and anticipate your orders with zeal and rapidity. And you must give him in return food and raiment and take care for his other needs. Do not harness him like an unreasoning animal nor oppress .him with weights too heavy and too numerous for his capacity, nor heap insults upon him, nor drag him down by threats and menaces into cruel despondency. Rather grant him time and places for respite according to some regular rule. For while “not too much of anything” is an excellent maxim in every case, it is particularly so as between masters and servants.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="84"><p><ref target="7-359-b"/>  When however 

you have received his services for the fullest term required, namely, six years, and when the truly sacred number of the seventh year is about to begin, grant his freedom to him who is naturally free and grant it without hesitation, my friend, and rejoice that you have found an opportunity of benefiting the highest of living creatures, man, in his chief interest. For a slave can have no greater boon than freedom.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="85"><p><ref target="7-359-c"/>  Be 

glad, too, to crown your benefaction by bestowing something of each of your various kinds of property to start him on his way. For it is a praise to you that he should not leave your home penniless but well stocked in resources to procure what is necessary.


<pb n="361"/>


Otherwise the same thing may happen again. He may be reduced by need to his old unhappy plight and compelled to undertake slavery again through lack of the means of life, and the boon you bestowed upon him may be cancelled. So much for the poor.
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="86"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="19"/> Then follows a commandment to let the 

land lie fallow during the seventh year.<ref target="7-361-a"/>  There are several reasons for this. In the first place he wished to give seven its honourable position in all the series in which time is measured, namely, days, months and years. For every seventh day is holy, a Sabbath as the Hebrews call it, and it is in the seventh month in every year that the chief of all the feasts falls, and therefore naturally the seventh year also has been marked out for a share in the dignity which belongs to the number. And there is this second reason.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="87"><p> 

Do not, he says, be entirely under the power of lucre, but submit voluntarily to some loss, so that you may find it easy to bear some involuntary injury, if ever it should occur, instead of resenting it as some strange and alien misfortune and falling into despair. For some of the rich are so poor-spirited that when adversity overtakes them, they are as mournful and depressed as if they had been robbed of their whole substance.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="88"><p> But among 

the followers of Moses all who have been his true disciples, trained in his excellent institutions from their earliest years, by allowing even rich territory to lie idle inure themselves to bear privations calmly and by the lesson of magnanimity thus learned voluntarily and deliberately to let even undoubted


<pb n="363"/>


sources of wealth fall almost from their very hands.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="89"><p><ref target="7-363-a"/>   There is also, I think, this third suggestion, 

that men should absolutely abstain from putting any oppressive burden upon anyone else. For if the different parts of the earth which cannot share in any sensations of pain or pleasure yet have to be given respite, how much more must this be the case with men who not only possess the sense which is common also to the irrational animals but even the special gift of reason through which the painful feelings caused by toil and labour stamp and record themselves in mental pictures, more vivid than mere sensation!</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="90"><p> Let so-called masters therefore cease 

from imposing upon their slaves severe and scarcely endurable orders, which break down their bodies by violent usage and force the soul to collapse before the body.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="91"><p> You need not grudge to moderate your 

orders. The result will be that you yourselves will enjoy proper attention and that your servants will carry out their orders readily and accept their duties not just for a short time to be abandoned through wearying too quickly, and, indeed, we may say, as if old age had prematurely overtaken them in their labours. On the contrary, they will prolong their youth to the utmost, like athletes, not those who fatten themselves up into full fleshiness, but those who regularly train themselves by “dry sweatings”<ref target="7-363-b"/>  to acquire what is necessary and useful for life.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="92"><p>  So too let rulers of cities cease from 


<pb n="365"/>


racking them with taxes and tolls as heavy as they are constant. Such rulers both fill their own coffers and while hoarding money hoard also illiberal vices which defile the whole of civic life.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="93"><p><ref target="7-365-a"/>  For they purposely 

choose as tax-gatherers the most ruthless of men, brimful of inhumanity, and put into their hands resources for overreaching. These persons add to their natural brutality the immunity they gain from their masters’ instructions, and in their determination to accommodate every action to those masters’ pleasure they leave no severity untried, however barbarous, and banish mercy and gentleness even from their dreams.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="94"><p> And therefore in 

carrying out their collecting they create universal chaos and confusion and apply their exactions not merely to the property of their victims but also to their bodies, on which they inflict insults and outrages and forms of torture quite original in their savagery.  Indeed, I have heard of persons who, actuated by abnormal frenzy and cruelty, have not even spared the dead, persons who become so utterly brutalized that they venture even to flog corpses with whips.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="95"><p> And when anyone censured the 

extraordinary cruelty shewn in refusing to allow even death, the release and in very truth the “end” of all ills, to procure freedom from insult for those who are now beyond its reach, and in causing them to undergo outrage instead of the normal rites of burial, the line of defence adopted was worse than the accusation. They treated the dead, they said, with such contempt not for the useless purpose of insulting the deaf and senseless dust but in order to excite the pity of those who were related to them by birth or some other tie of fellowship, and thus

<pb n="367"/>


urge them to ransom the bodies of their friends by making a final gift in payment for them.
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="96"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="20"/> Foolish, foolish people, I would say to them, have you 

not first learnt the lesson which you teach, or are you competent to induce others to shew pity, even with the cruellest actions before them,<ref target="7-367-a"/>  when you have exscinded all kindly and humane feelings from your own souls? And this you have done, though you had no lack of good advisers, particularly in our laws, which have relieved even the land from its yearly tolls and provided it with a rest and respite.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="97"><p>  This 

land, though to all appearance a lifeless thing, is put into a condition to make its requital and to repay a boon which it received as a free gift but is now eager to return. For the immunity which it has during the seventh year and its rest from labour and complete freedom during the whole annual cycle give it a fertility in the next year which causes it to bear twice as much or even many times as much as in the previous years.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="98"><p> We may also note that the trainers 

of athletes take much the same line in dealing with their pupils. When they have thoroughly drilled them by an unbroken course of exercises, before they reach the point of exhaustion, they give them a fresh lease of life by providing relaxations, not only from the labour of the training itself but from the dietary regulations as to food and drink, the hardships of which they abate in order to make the soul cheerful and the body comfortable.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="99"><p> And we 

must not suppose that here we have the professional trainers to hard work appearing as instructors in


<pb n="369"/>


slackness and luxury; they are following a scientific method by which further strength and power is given to what is already strong and powerful, and vigour enhanced as though it were a harmony by alternating relaxation with tension.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="100"><p> This truth I have learnt 

from the never-failing wisdom of nature who, knowing how toil-worn and weary our race becomes, divided our time into day and night, giving the hours of wakefulness to one and of sleep to the other.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="101"><p> For, 

most careful of mothers, her anxious thought was that her children should not be exhausted. In the daylight she wakens our bodies and stimulates them to carry out all the offices and demands of life, and reproaches those who are making it their practice to loiter through life in an idle and voluptuous way. But at night she sounds the recall as in war and summons them to repose and take care of their bodies.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="102"><p> And 

men casting off all the sore burden of affairs which has lain heavy upon them from morn till eve, turn homewards and betake themselves to rest, and in the deep sleep which falls upon them cast off the distempers of their daylight troubles, and then again unwearied and full of fresh vigour hasten eagerly each to his own familiar occupation.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="103"><p> This double 

course nature has assigned to men by means of sleeping and waking with the result that by alternating activity with inaction they have increased readiness and nimbleness in the various parts of their bodies.
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="104"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="21"/> These considerations the prophetic author 

of our laws had before his eyes when he proclaimed a rest for the land and made the husbandman stay his work after six years. But he gave this enactment not only on the grounds which I have mentioned but also moved by that habitual kindliness which he aims

<pb n="371"/>


at infusing into every part of his legislation, thereby impressing on the readers of the sacred scriptures the stamp of good and neighbourly customs.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="105"><p> For he 

forbids them to close up any field during the seventh year.<ref target="7-371-a"/>  All olive-yards and vineyards are to be left wide open and so with the other kinds of property, whether of sown crops or orchard-trees, thus giving an unrestricted use of such fruits as are of natural growth to the poor quite as much, if not more so, than to the owners.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="106"><p> Thus on the one hand he did 

not allow the masters to do any work of tillage because he wished to avoid giving them the painful feeling that they had incurred the expenditure but did not receive the income in return, and on the other hand he thought fit that the poor should for this year at any rate enjoy as their own what appeared to belong to others, and in this way took from them any appearance of humiliation or possibility of being reproached as beggars.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="107"><p> May not our passionate affection 

well go out to laws charged with such kindly feeling, which teaches the rich to give liberally and share what they have with others and encourages the poor not to be always dancing attendance on the houses of the wealthy, as though compelled to resort thither to make up their own deficiency, but sometimes also to come claiming a source of wealth in the fruits which, as I have said, develop untilled and which they can treat as their own?</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="108"><p>  Widows and orphans and all others who are neglected and ignored because they have no surplus 

of income have at this time such a surplus and find themselves suddenly affluent through the gifts of God, Who invites them to share with the owners under the sanction of the holy number seven.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="109"><p> And 


<pb n="373"/>


indeed all stock-breeders feel at liberty to take out their own cattle in search of pasturage and to select meadow-land of good herbage and particularly suitable for grazing their beasts. Thus they take full advantage of the immunity secured by the time of freedom. And this is not opposed by any grudging on the master’s side. They are under the sway of a very ancient custom, which through long familiarity has won its way to the standing of nature.
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="110"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="22"/> While laying down this first foundation of 

moderation and humanity, he built on it by adding years to the number of seven times seven and consecrated the whole of the fiftieth year.<ref target="7-373-a"/>  This he made the subject of many special enactments, all of remarkable excellence, apart from those which are common to other seventh years.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="111"><p><ref target="7-373-b"/>  The first of these 

enactments is as follows. He considers that alienated estates ought to be restored to their original possessors in order that the apportionments should be secured to the families and that no one to whom they had been allotted should be altogether deprived of the grant.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="112"><p><ref target="7-373-c"/>  For since times of adversity often arise 

which make it necessary for some persons to sell their property, he made provision for the just needs of such persons and at the same time took steps to prevent the purchasers being deceived, by accompanying the permission to the vendors to sell with very clear instructions to the purchasers as to the

terms of the transaction.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="113"><p> “Do not pay the price,” 

he says, “of complete ownership, but only for a fixed number of years and a lower limit than fifty.” For the sale should represent not real property but fruits, and this for two most convincing reasons.

Another reason is that each of the holders has a portion assigned to him by lot, and that this should be taken from him is contrary to the law’s conception of justice.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="114"><p> Anyone, therefore, who before the fifty years are 

completed has the means to recover his own property, or anyone else very closely related to him, is urged by the lawgiver to take every step to recover the land at the price which he got for it, and not to occasion loss to the purchaser who helped him at the time when he needed it.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="115"><p> On the other hand he sympathized with 

the poor man and shewed him pity by restoring to him the additional wealth which he originally possessed, excepting fields which had been dedicated by a vow, and therefore rank with votive offerings.<ref target="7-375-b"/>  Religion forbids that time should affect the validity of a votive offering, and therefore it is ordained that the proper price for such estates should be demanded and that no concessions should be made to the votary.
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="116"><p><milestone unit="para"/>XXIII These are the rules for cases where the 

apportionments and holdings consist of land. There are different regulations as to houses.<ref target="7-375-c"/>  Houses in some cases belong to cities and are inside the walls, and others are farm-buildings in the country outside the walls. Consequently the law allows the latter to be redeemable at any time, and prescribes that any that have not been ransomed by the fiftieth year

<pb n="377"/>


should be restored without compensation to the former owner as in the case of real property, for farm-buildings are a part of real property.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="117"><p> But houses within 

the walls may be recoverable by the vendors for the space of a year, but after the year are absolutely secured to the purchasers who are not liable to suffer any injury from the general remission in the fiftieth year.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="118"><p> His reason is that he wishes to give the 

newcomers also a basis on which they may feel themselves firmly established in the country. For since they have no apportionment of land as they were not counted when the holdings were distributed, the law assigned to them their houses in fee simple in its anxiety that those who had come as suppliants and refugees to the laws should not be cast adrift.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="119"><p> For when the land was apportioned according to the tribes 

the cities were not distributed, nor indeed built in city form at all, and the inhabitants took for their dwellings the outbuildings in the country. Subsequently when they left these and became concentrated as the feeling of unity and friendship naturally grew stronger in the course of many years, they built houses adjacent to each other, thus forming cities. And of these, as I have said, they assigned a share to the newcomers, to prevent them finding themselves cut off from holding property both in the country and in the cities.
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="120"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="24"/> The legislation with regard to the consecrated 

tribe is as follows.<ref target="7-377-a"/>  The temple-keepers were not allotted a section of land by the law, which considered that they were sufficiently provided for by the first-fruits, but assigned them instead forty-eight cities to dwell in, with a surrounding frontage in each case of two thousand cubits.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="121"><p> Houses within 

these were not, like the others within the walls,

<pb n="379"/>


secured to the purchasers, if the vendors could not find the means to redeem them within the year, but were liable to be redeemed for an unlimited period just as the lay population<ref target="7-379-a"/>  could redeem the farm buildings, to which the dwelling-houses of the Levites correspond. For these were all that fell to their share in that great territory, and thus he considered that being once received they ought not to be taken back, any more than the farm-buildings in the case of those to whom the holdings were apportioned. So much for the subject of houses.
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="122"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="25"/> Similar rules to those already stated are 

laid down as to the relations between creditors and debtors and between servants and masters.<ref target="7-379-b"/>  Creditors are not to exact interest from their fellow-nationals but to be content with recovering what they provided. Masters are to treat their purchased slaves as their hired servants, not as their slaves by nature, and give them secure access to liberty on the spot if they can provide their ransom, or in the case of the needy at a later time, when either the seventh year from the beginning of their slavery or the fiftieth arrives, in the latter case even though only a single day has elapsed since the man was reduced to that condition. For that time is accepted as the remission and actually is such, when all reverse their course and turn back to the prosperity of the past.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="123"><p> But the law does permit the acquisition of slaves 

from other nations<ref target="7-379-c"/>  for two reasons; first, that a distinction should be made between fellow-countrymen and aliens; secondly, that that most indispensable possession, domestic service, should not be absolutely



<pb n="381"/>


excluded from his commonwealth. For the course of life contains a vast number of circumstances which demand the ministrations of slaves.
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="124"><p><milestone unit="para"/><ref target="7-381-a"/> The heirs of parents are to be sons,<ref target="7-381-b"/>  or failing sons 

daughters. For just as in nature men take precedence of women, so too in the scale of relationships they should take the first place in succeeding to the property and filling the position of the departed which they have ceased to hold, debarred by an inevitable law which admits to immortality nothing that is mortal or earth-born.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="125"><p> But if virgins are left 

without a dower, nothing of the kind having been settled on them by the parents while still alive, they should share equally with the males. The charge of protecting the girls left thus desolate and superintending their development, and the expenses of providing anything required for their maintenance and education as befits maidens should fall upon the head magistrate<ref target="7-381-c"/> ; also when the time comes, the duty of arranging a suitable marriage and choosing husbands who are selected on their merits and approved in all respects.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="126"><p> And these should be, if 

possible, of the same family as the girls, or if that cannot be, at any rate of the same ward and tribe, in order that the portions assigned as dowry should not




<pb n="383"/>


be alienated by inter-marriage with other tribes, but should retain the place given to them in the allotments originally made on the basis of tribes.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="127"><p><ref target="7-383-a"/>  But if 

the deceased has no descendants, the brothers must proceed to the succession, for brothers rank next in tables of relationship with sons and daughters. If the dead man has no brother, the succession must pass to the uncles on the father’s side, and if there are no uncles, to the aunts, and then to the next nearest among their other connexions or kinsfolk.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="128"><p> But if 

kinsfolk are so scarce that no blood-relation remains, then the tribe shall be the heir.<ref target="7-383-b"/>  For the tribe is in a sense a kinship with a wider and more all-embracing compass.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="129"><p><ref target="7-383-c"/> One question, however, which 

is raised by some inquirers should not be passed over in silence. Why, they ask, does the Law when dealing with the regulations of inheritance mention kinsmen of every degree and fellow-wardsmen and fellow-tribesmen, but leaves parents alone unmentioned who would naturally inherit from the children as the children do from them? The answer, good sir, is that the law, God-given as it is, and ever desirous to follow the course of nature, held that no sinister thought should be introduced. Parents pray that they may leave behind them alive the children they have begotten to succeed to their name, race and property, and the imprecations of their implacable enemies are just the opposite, that the sons and daughters may die before their parents.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="130"><p> Now he did not 


<pb n="385"/>


wish to speak plainly of anything so out of tune with and discordant to the harmony and concord which prevails throughout the cosmic order as the death of children while the parents survive, and there fore he complied both with necessity and decency<ref target="7-385-a"/>  in not ordaining that mothers and fathers should inherit from their sons and daughters. He knew that such an event was not in accordance with the ordinary course of life or with nature.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="131"><p> So while he avoided 

appointing the parents in undisguised terms as heirs to the property of their dead children, lest by assigning to them an acquisition of so undesirable a kind he should seem to be casting a slur upon their mourning or reminding them of their misfortunes, he adopted another way of conveying the ownership to them, a simple specific for a great mischief.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="132"><p> What 

was this way? He declares the father’s brothers to be the heirs of their nephews, a privilege doubtless given to the uncle for the sake of the father, unless anyone is foolish enough to suppose that a person who honours A for the sake of B is deliberately dishonouring B. Is it the case that those who pay court to the acquaintances of their friends are neglecting those friends? Is it not rather the truth that their affectionate care for all that might honour these acquaintances<ref target="7-385-b"/>  shews regard for the friends also? On the same principle the law, when it nominates the father’s brother to share in the inheritance because of his relationship to the father, much more nominates the father, not in actual words it is true for reasons already stated, but with a force more


<pb n="387"/>


recognizable than words, leaving no doubt of the intention of the lawgiver.
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="133"><p><milestone unit="para"/>The eldest son does not share equally with his 

juniors, but is adjudged a double portion,<ref target="7-387-a"/>  one reason being that his parents who before were but man and wife, owe to the first-born the fact that they have later become father and mother. Another is that it is their first-born who began to use these names in addressing his parents.<ref target="7-387-b"/>  The third reason is the most important, that what was before their birth a house of barren stock has become fruitful for the preservation of the human race, a preservation which is sown in marriage and fructified in the birth of children, starting with the eldest.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="134"><p> This was the 

reason, I suppose, that the first-born sons of the enemies who had shewn themselves so merciless in action, were cut off in wholesale massacre in a single night, as the Holy Scriptures tell us, while the first-born of our nation were dedicated by consecration as a thank-offering to God. For it was just that on the enemy should fall the weight of a blow for which no consolation was possible, namely, the destruction of their foremost rank, while God Who wrought the salvation was honoured by the dedication as first-fruits of those who headed the line of children.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="135"><p><ref target="7-387-c"/> But there 

are some who after marrying and begetting children unlearn in their later days what they knew of self-restraint and are wrecked on the reef of incontinence. Seized with a mad passion for other women, they maltreat those who hitherto belonged to them and behave to the children they have begotten by them as though they were uncles rather than fathers, copy the unrighteousness shewn

<pb n="389"/>


by stepmothers to the first family and altogether devote themselves and all they have to the second wives and their children, overcome by the vilest of passions, voluptuousness. Such lusts the law would not have hesitated to bridle if it were possible, and prevent them from frisking and plunging still more.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="136"><p> But since it is difficult, or rather impossible, to heal 

the frenzy goaded into savagery, it left the father to his fate as one in the grip of an incurable disease but did not disregard the son of the wife who was wronged through his passion for another, but bade him take the double portion in the distribution between the brothers.<ref target="7-389-a"/>  There are several reasons for this.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="137"><p> In 

the first place, it punishes the culprit by forcing him to give good treatment to the person to whom he intended to give the reverse and renders him incapable of carrying out his ill-judged judgement. This it effects by conferring benefits on the person who was likely to suffer loss at his hands, and by taking upon itself the parental position which had been abandoned by the natural father in so far as the eldest child was concerned.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="138"><p>  Secondly, 

it shews mercy and pity for the victims of injustice whom it relieves of a very grievous trouble by enabling them to share in the boon thus bestowed. For naturally we may suppose that the gratification felt by the son at obtaining the double portion is shared by the mother, encouraged as she is by the humanity of the law which refuses to allow her and her family to lie entirely at the mercy of her enemies.  And there was a third reason.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="139"><p> 

Being gifted with a power to judge justly, it reflected that the father had bestowed his bounties generously on the children of the beloved wife

<pb n="391"/>


because of his affection for her, but left the children of the hated wife entirely out of consideration owing to his hostility to their mother, so that the former even in his lifetime inherited more than their equal share, and the latter might expect at his death to find themselves robbed of the whole patrimony. And therefore it decreed that the son of the discarded wife should have the eldest son’s privilege of the double share, in order to equalize the partition between both families.<ref target="7-391-a"/>  Enough on these matters.
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="140"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="26"/> Following the order stated above, we record 

the third type of feast which we will proceed to explain. This is the New Moon, or beginning of the lunar month,<ref target="7-391-b"/>  namely the period between one conjunction and the next, the length of which has been accurately calculated in the astronomical schools. The new moon holds its place among the feasts for many reasons. First, because it is the beginning of the month, and the beginning, both in number and in time, deserves honour. Secondly, because when it arrives, nothing in heaven is left without light, for while at the conjunction, when the moon is lost to sight under the sun, the side which faces earth is darkened, when the new month begins it resumes its natural brightness.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="141"><p> The third reason is, that the 

stronger or more powerful element at that time supplies the help which is needed to the smaller and weaker. For it is just then that the sun begins to illumine the moon with the light which we perceive


<pb n="393"/>


and the moon reveals its own beauty to the eye. And this is surely an obvious lesson inculcating kindness and humanity and bidding men never grudge their own good things, but imitating the blessed and happy beings in heaven banish jealousy from the confines of the soul, producing what they have for all to see, treat it as common property, and give freely to the deserving.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="142"><p> The fourth reason 

is, that the moon traverses the zodiac in a shorter fixed period than any other heavenly body. For it accomplishes that revolution in the span of a single month, and therefore the conclusion of its circuit, when the moon ends its course at the starting-point at which it began, is honoured by the law, which declares that day a feast, again to teach us an admirable lesson, that in the conduct of life we should make the ends correspond with the beginnings. And this will be effected if we keep our primitive appetites under the control of reason and do not permit them to rebel and riot like cattle that have no herdsman.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="143"><p>  As for the services that the moon 

renders to everything on earth, there is no need to dilate upon them. The proofs are perfectly clear. As the moon increases, the rivers and fountains rise, and again diminish as it diminishes. Its phases cause the seas to withdraw and dwindle at the ebbtide, then suddenly rush back with the returning flood, and the air to undergo all manner of changes as the sky becomes clear or cloudy and alters in other ways. The fruits, both of the sown crops and orchard-trees, grow to their maturity according to the revolutions of the moon, which fosters and ripens everything that grows with the dewy and very gentle breezes




<pb n="395"/>


which it brings.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="144"><p> But, as I have said, this is not the 

time to dwell at length on the praises of the moon and record and catalogue the services which it renders to living creatures and everything on earth. It is for these or similar reasons that the New Moon is honoured and obtains its place among the feasts.
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="145"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="27"/> After the New Moon comes the fourth 

feast, called the Crossing-feast,<ref target="7-395-a"/>  which the Hebrews in their native tongue call Pascha. In this festival many myriads of victims from noon till eventide<ref target="7-395-b"/>  are offered by the whole people, old and young alike, raised for that particular day to the dignity of the priesthood.<ref target="7-395-c"/>  For at other times the priests according to the ordinance of the law carry out both the public sacrifices and those offered by private individuals. But on this occasion the whole nation performs the sacred rites and acts as priest with pure hands and complete immunity.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="146"><p> The reason for this is as follows: the 

festival is a reminder and thank-offering for that great migration from Egypt which was made by more than two millions<ref target="7-395-d"/>  of men and women in obedience to the oracles vouchsafed to them. Now at that time they had left a land brimful of inhumanity which made a practice of expelling strangers, and what was worst of all, assigned divine honours to irrational creatures, not merely domesticated animals, but even wild





<pb n="397"/>


beasts. So exceedingly joyful were they that in their vast enthusiasm and impatient eagerness, they naturally enough sacrificed without waiting for their priest.<ref target="7-397-a"/>  This practice which on that occasion was the result of a spontaneous and instinctive emotion, was sanctioned by the law once in every year to remind them of their duty of thanksgiving. These are the facts as discovered by the study of ancient history.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="147"><p>  But to those who are accustomed to turn literal facts 

into allegory, the Crossing-festival suggests the purification of the soul. They say that the lover of wisdom is occupied solely in crossing from the body and the passions, each of which overwhelms him like a torrent, unless the rushing current be dammed and held back by the principles of virtue.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="148"><p>  On 

this day every dwelling-house is invested with the outward semblance and dignity of a temple. The victim is then slaughtered and dressed for the festal meal which befits the occasion. The guests assembled for the banquet have been cleansed by purificatory lustrations, and are there not as in other festive gatherings, to indulge the belly with wine and viands, but to fulfil with prayers and hymns the custom handed down by their fathers.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="149"><p> The day on which 

this national festivity occurs may very properly be noted. It is the 14th of the month, a number formed of the sum of two sevens, thus bringing out the fact that seven never fails to appear in anything worthy of honour but everywhere takes the lead in conferring prestige and dignity.
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="150"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="28"/> With the Crossing-feast he combines one 

in which the food consumed is of a different and unfamiliar


<pb n="399"/>


kind, namely, unleavened bread, which also gives its name to the feast.<ref target="7-399-a"/>  This may be regarded from two points of view, one peculiar to the nation, referring to the migration just mentioned, the other universal, following the lead of nature, and in agreement with the general cosmic order. To show that this affirmation is absolutely true, will require some examination. This month comes seventh in order and number as judged by the cycle of the sun, but in importance it is first, and therefore is described as first in the sacred books.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="151"><p><ref target="7-399-b"/>  The reason for this I 

believe to be as follows. In the spring equinox we have a kind of likeness and portraiture of that first epoch in which this world was created. The elements were then separated and placed in harmonious order with reference to themselves and each other. The heaven was adorned with sun and moon and the rhythmic movements and circlings of the other stars, both fixed and planetary. So too the earth was adorned with every manner of plants, and the uplands and lowlands, wherever the soil had depth and goodness, became luxuriant and verdant.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="152"><p> So every year God reminds us of the creation of the 

world by setting before our eyes the spring when everything blooms and flowers. And therefore there is good reason for describing it in the laws as the first month because in a sense it is an image of the primal origin reproduced from it like the imprint from an archetypal seal.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="153"><p> But the month of the 

autumnal equinox, though first in order as measured by the course of the sun, is not called first in the law,



<pb n="401"/>


because at that time all the fruits have been gathered in and the trees are shedding their leaves and all the bloom which the spring brought in its prime already scorched by the heat of the summer sun is wilting under the dry currents of air.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="154"><p> And so to give the 

name of “first” to a month in which both uplands and lowlands are sterilized and unfruitful seemed to him altogether unsuitable and incongruous. For things which come first and head the list should be associated with all the fairest and most desirable things which are the sources of birth and increase to animals and fruits and plants, not with the processes of destruction and the dark thoughts which it suggests.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="155"><p> The feast begins at the middle of the 

month, on the fifteenth day, when the moon is full, a day purposely chosen because then there is no darkness, but everything is continuously lighted up as the sun shines from morning to evening and the moon from evening to morning and while the stars give place to each other no shadow is cast upon their brightness.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="156"><p><ref target="7-401-a"/>   Again, the feast is held 

for seven days to mark the precedence and honour which the number holds in the universe, indicating that nothing which tends to cheerfulness and public mirth and thankfulness to God should fail to be accompanied with memories of the sacred seven which He intended to be the source and fountain to


<pb n="403"/>


men of all good things.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="157"><p> Two days out of the seven, 

the first and the last, are declared holy. In this way he gave a natural precedence to the beginning and the end; but he also wished to create a harmony as on a musical instrument between the intermediates and the extremes. Perhaps too he wished to harmonize the feast with a past which adjoins the first day and a future which adjoins the last. These two, the first and the last, have each the other’s properties in addition to their own. The first is the beginning of the feast and the end of the preceding past, the seventh is the end of the feast and the beginning of the coming future. Thus, as I have said before,<ref target="7-403-a"/>  the whole life of the man of worth may be regarded as equivalent to a feast held by one who has expelled grief and fear and desire and the other passions and distempers of the soul.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="158"><p>  The 

bread is unleavened either because our forefathers, when under divine guidance they were starting on their migration, were so intensely hurried that they brought the lumps of dough unleavened,<ref target="7-403-b"/>  or else because at that season, namely, the springtime, when the feast is held, the fruit of the corn has not reached its perfection, for the fields are in the ear stage and not yet mature for harvest. It was the imperfection of this fruit which belonged to the future, though it was to reach its perfection very shortly, that he considered might be paralleled by the unleavened food, which is also imperfect, and serves to remind us of the comforting hope that nature, possessing as she does a superabundant wealth of things needful, is already preparing her yearly gifts to the human



<pb n="405"/>


race.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="159"><p> Another suggestion made by the interpreters 

of the holy scriptures is that food, when unleavened, is a gift of nature, when leavened is a work of art. For men in their eagerness to temper the barely necessary with the pleasant, have learned through practice to soften by art what nature has made hard.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="160"><p> Since, then, the spring-time feast, as I have laid down, 

is a reminder of the creation of the world, and its earliest inhabitants, children of earth in the first or second generation, must have used the gifts of the universe in their unperverted state before pleasure had got the mastery, he ordained for use on this occasion the food most fully in accordance with the season. He wished every year to rekindle the embers of the serious and ascetic mode of faring, and to employ the leisure of a festal assembly to confer admiration and honour on the old-time life of frugality and economy, and as far as possible to assimilate our present-day life to that of the distant past.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="161"><p> These 

statements are especially guaranteed by the exposure of the twelve loaves corresponding in number to the tribes, on the holy table.<ref target="7-405-a"/>  They are all unleavened, the clearest possible example of a food free from admixture, in the preparation of which art for the sake of pleasure has no place, but only nature, providing nothing save what is indispensable for its use. So much for this.
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="162"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="29"/> But within the feast there is another feast 

following directly after the first day. This is called the “Sheaf,”<ref target="7-405-b"/>  a name given to it from the ceremony which consists in bringing to the altar a sheaf as a first-fruit, both of the land which has been given to


<pb n="407"/>


the nation to dwell in and of the whole earth, so that it serves that purpose both to the nation in particular and for the whole human race in general.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="163"><p> The 

reason of this is<ref target="7-407-a"/>  that the Jewish nation is to the whole inhabited world what the priest is to the State. For the holy office in very truth belongs to the nation because it carries out all the rites of purification and both in body and soul obeys the injunctions of the divine laws, which restrict the pleasures of the belly and the parts below it and the horde . . . setting reason to guide the irrational senses, and also check and rein in the wild and extravagant impulses of the soul, sometimes through gentler remonstrances and philosophical admonitions, sometimes through severer and more forcible condemnations and the fear of punishment which they hold over it as a deterrent.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="164"><p>  But not only is the legislation in a sense 

a lesson on the sacred office, not only does a life led in conformity with the laws necessarily confer priesthood or rather high priesthood in the judgement of truth, but there is another point of special importance. There is no bound or limit to the number of deities, male and female, honoured in different cities, the vain inventions


<pb n="409"/>


of the tribe of poets and of the great multitude of men to whom the quest for truth is a task of difficulty and beyond their powers of research. Yet instead of all peoples having the same gods, we find different nations venerating and honouring different gods. The gods of the foreigner they do not regard as gods at all. They treat their acceptance by the others as a jest and a laughing-stock and denounce the extreme folly of those who honour them and the failure to think soundly shewn thereby.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="165"><p> But if He 

exists Whom all Greeks and barbarians unanimously acknowledge,<ref target="7-409-a"/>  the supreme Father of gods and men and the Maker of the whole universe, whose nature is invisible and inscrutable not only by the eye, but by the mind, yet is a matter into which every student of astronomical science<ref target="7-409-b"/>  and other philosophy desires to make research and leaves nothing untried which would help him to discern it and do it service—then it was the duty of all men to cleave to Him and not introduce new gods staged as by machinery<ref target="7-409-c"/>  to receive the same honours.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="166"><p> When they went 

wrong in what was the most vital matter of all, it is the literal truth that the error which the rest committed was corrected by the Jewish nation which passed over all created objects because they were created and naturally liable to destruction and chose



<pb n="411"/>


the service only of the Uncreated and Eternal, first because of its excellence, secondly because it is profitable to dedicate and attach ourselves to the elder rather than to the younger, to the ruler rather than to the subject, to the maker rather than to the thing created.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="167"><p> And therefore it astonishes me to 

see that some people venture to accuse of inhumanity the nation which has shewn so profound a sense of fellowship and goodwill to all men everywhere, by using its prayers and festivals and first-fruit offerings as a means of supplication for the human race in general and of making its homage to the truly existent God in the name of those who have evaded the service which it was their duty to give, as well as of itself.
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="168"><p><milestone unit="para"/>So much for this feast as a thanksgiving for the 

whole human race. But the nation in particular also gives thanks for many reasons. First, because they do not continue for ever wandering broadcast over islands and continents and occupying the homelands of others as strangers and vagrants, open to the reproach of waiting to seize the goods of others. Nor have they just borrowed a section of this great country for lack of means to purchase,<ref target="7-411-a"/>  but have acquired the land and cities for their own property, a heritage in which they live as long established citizens and therefore offer first-fruits from it as a sacred duty.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="169"><p> Secondly, the land which has fallen 

to their lot is not derelict nor indifferent soil, but good land, well fitted for breeding domestic animals


<pb n="413"/>


and bearing fruits in vast abundance. For in it there is no poverty of soil and even such parts as seem to be stony or stubborn are intersected by soft veins of very great depth, the richness of which adapts them for producing life.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="170"><p> But besides this it 

was no uninhabited land which they received, but one which contained a populous nation and great cities filled with stalwart citizens. Yet these cities have been stripped of their inhabitants and the whole nation, except for a small fraction, has disappeared, partly through wars, partly through heavensent visitations, a consequence of their strange and monstrous practices of iniquity and all their heinous acts of impiety aimed at the subversion of the statutes of nature. Thus should those who took their place as inhabitants gain instruction from the evil fate of others and learn from their history the lesson that if they emulate deeds of vice<ref target="7-413-a"/>  they will suffer the same doom, but if they pay honour to a life of virtue they will possess the heritage appointed to them and be ranked not as settlers but as native-born.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="171"><p>  We have shewn, then, that the Sheaf was an offering 

both of the nation’s own land and of the whole earth, given in thanks for the fertility and abundance which the nation and the whole human race desired to enjoy. But we must not fail to note that there are many things of great advantage represented by the offering. First, that we remember God, and what thing more perfectly good can we find than this? Secondly, that we make a requital, as is most fully due, to Him Who is the true cause of the good harvest.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="172"><p> For the 

results due to the husbandman’s art are few or as good


<pb n="415"/>


as nothing, furrows drawn, a plant dug or ringed around, a trench deepened, excessive overgrowth lopped, or other similar operations. But what we owe to nature is all indispensable and useful, a soil of great fruitfulness, fields irrigated by fountains or rivers, spring-fed or winter torrents, and watered by seasonable rains, happily tempered states of the air which sends us the breath of its truly life-giving breezes, numberless varieties of crops and plants. For which of these has man for its inventor or parent?</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="173"><p> No, it is nature, their parent, who has not grudged to 

man a share in the goods which are her very own, but judging him to be the chiefest of mortal animals because he has obtained a portion of reason and good sense, chose him as the worthiest and invited him to share what was hers to give. For all this it is meet and right that the hospitality of God should be praised and revered, God Who provides for His guests the whole earth as a truly hospitable home ever filled not merely with necessaries, but with the means of luxurious living.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="174"><p> Further, we learn not to neglect 

benefactors, for he who is grateful to God, Who needs nothing and is His own fullness,<ref target="7-415-a"/>  will thus become accustomed to be grateful to men whose needs are numberless.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="175"><p>  The sheaf thus offered is 

of barley, shewing that the use of the inferior grains is not open to censure. It would be irreverent to give first-fruits of them all, as most of them are made to give pleasure rather than to be used as necessaries, and equally unlawful to enjoy and partake of any


<pb n="417"/>


form of food for which thanks had not been offered in the proper and rightful manner. And therefore the law ordained<ref target="7-417-a"/>  that the first-fruit offerings should be made of barley, a species of grain regarded as holding the second place in value as food. For wheat holds the first place and as the first-fruit of this has greater distinction, the law postponed it to a more suitable season in the future. It does not anticipate matters, but puts it in storage for the time being, so that the various thank-offerings may be adjusted to their appointed dates as they recur.
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="176"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="30"/> The festival of the Sheaf, which has all 

these grounds of precedence,<ref target="7-417-b"/>  indicated in the law, is also in fact anticipatory of another greater feast. For it is from it that the fiftieth day is reckoned, by counting seven sevens, which are then crowned with the sacred number by the monad,<ref target="7-417-c"/>  which is an incorporeal image of God, Whom it resembles because it also stands alone. This is the primary excellence exhibited by fifty, but there is another which should be mentioned.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="177"><p> One reason among others which 

makes its nature so marvellous and admirable is that it is formed by what the mathematicians tell us is the most elemental and venerable of existing things,<ref target="7-417-d"/>  namely, the right-angled triangle. In length its




<pb n="419"/>


sides are 5, 3, 4, of which the sum is twelve, the pattern of the zodiac cycle, the duplication of the highly prolific six, which is the starting-point of perfection since it is the sum of the factors which produce it through multiplication. But we find that the sides when raised to the second power, <hi rend="italic">i.e.</hi> 3 x 3 + 4 x 4 + 5 x 5, make 50, so that we must say that 50 is superior to 12 in the same degree as the second power is superior to the first.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="178"><p> And if the 

lesser of these is represented by the most excellent of the heavenly spheres, the zodiac, the greater, namely 50, must be the pattern of some quite superior form of existence. But a discussion of this would be out of place at this point. It is quite enough for the present to call attention to the difference, so as to avoid treating a prominent fact as of secondary importance.
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="179"><p><milestone unit="para"/>The feast which is held when the number 50 is 

reached has acquired the title of” first-products.”<ref target="7-419-a"/>  On it it is the custom to bring two leavened loaves of wheaten bread for a sample offering of that kind of grain as the best form of food. One explanation of the name, “Feast of First-products,” is that the first produce of the young wheat and the earliest fruit to appear is brought as a sample offering before the year’s harvest comes to be used by men.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="180"><p> It is 

no doubt just and a religious duty that those who have received freely a generous supply of sustenance so necessary and wholesome and also palatable in the highest degree should not enjoy or taste it at all until they have brought a sample offering to the Donor, not indeed as a gift, for all things and possessions and gifts are His, but as a token, however small,


<pb n="421"/>


by which they show a disposition of thankfulness and loyalty to Him Who, while He needs no favours, sends the showers of His favours in never-failing constancy.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="181"><p> Another reason for the name may be that wheaten 

grain is pre-eminent as the first and best product, all the other sown crops ranking in the second class in comparison; for as an archon in a city or a pilot in a ship are said to be the first because they regulate the course of the city or the ship, as the case may be, so wheaten grain has received the compound name of “first-product” because it is the best of all the cereals, which it would not be,<ref target="7-421-a"/>  unless it were also the food used by the best of living creatures.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="182"><p> The 

loaves are leavened in spite of the prohibition<ref target="7-421-b"/>  against bringing leaven to the altar, not to produce any contradiction in the ordinances, but to ensure that so to speak there shall be a single kind, both for receiving and giving. By receiving I mean the thanksgiving of the offerers, by giving the immediate return without any delay to the offerers of what they bring, though not for their own use.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="183"><p> For food that has 

once been consecrated will be used by those who have the right and authority, and that right belongs to those who act as priests who through the beneficence of the law have the right to partake of any thing brought to the altar which is not consumed by the undying fire—a privilege granted either as a payment for officiating or as a prize for the contests which they endure in the cause of piety, or a sacred allotment in lieu of land, in the apportionment of


<pb n="423"/>


which they had not received their proper share like the other tribes.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="184"><p>  But leaven is also a 

symbol for two other things: in one way it stands for food in its most complete and perfect form, such that in our daily usage none is found to be superior or more nourishing, and as wheat-meal is superior to that of the other seed crops, its excellence demands that the offering made in recognition of it should be of the same high quality.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="185"><p> The other point 

is more symbolical. Everything that is leavened rises, and joy is the rational elevation or rising of the soul.<ref target="7-423-a"/>  And there is nothing that exists which more naturally gives a man joy than the possession in generous abundance of necessaries. Such rightly call forth gladness and thanksgiving in those who by the leavened loaves give outward expression to the invisible sense of well-being in their hearts.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="186"><p>  The offering takes the form of loaves 

instead of wheaten meal,<ref target="7-423-b"/>  because when the wheat has come there is nothing still missing in the way of appetizing food. For we are told that of all the seed crops, wheat is the last to spring up and be ready for harvesting.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="187"><p> And these thank-offerings of 

the best kind are two in number for the two kinds of time, the past and the future; for the past, because our days have been spent in abundance, free from the experience of the evils of want and famine; for the future, because we have laid by and prepared resources to meet it, and are full of bright


<pb n="425"/>


hopes while we dispense and bring out for daily use the gifts of God as they are needed by the rules of good economy.<ref target="7-425-a"/> 
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="188"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="31"/> Next comes the opening of the sacred 

month,<ref target="7-425-b"/>  when it is customary to sound the trumpet in the temple at the same time that the sacrifices are brought there, and its name of “trumpet feast” is derived from this. It has a twofold significance, partly to the nation in particular, partly to all mankind in general. In the former sense it is a reminder of a mighty and marvellous event which came to pass when the oracles of the law were given from above.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="189"><p><ref target="7-425-c"/>  For then the sound of the trumpet pealed 

from heaven and reached, we may suppose, the ends of the universe, so that the event might strike terror even into those who were far from the spot and dwelling well nigh at the extremities of the earth, who would come to the natural conclusion that such mighty signs portended mighty consequences. And indeed what could men receive mightier or more profitable than the general laws which came from the mouth of God, not like the particular laws, through an interpreter?</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="190"><p>  This is a significance 

peculiar to the nation. What follows is common to all mankind. The trumpet is the instrument used in war, both to sound the advance against the enemy when the moment comes for engaging battle and also for recalling the troops when they have to separate and return to their respective camps. And there is another war not of human agency when nature is at strife in herself, when her parts make onslaught one on another and her law-abiding sense of equality




<pb n="427"/>


is vanquished by the greed for inequality.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="191"><p> Both 

these wars work destruction on the face of the earth. The enemy cut down the fruit-trees, ravage the country, set fire to the foodstuffs and the ripening ears of corn in the open fields, while the forces of nature use drought, rainstorms, violent moisture-laden winds, scorching sun-rays, intense cold accompanied by snow, with the regular harmonious alternations of the yearly seasons turned into disharmony, a state of things in my opinion due to the impiety which does not gain a gradual hold but comes rushing with the force of a torrent among those whom these things befall.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="192"><p> And therefore the law instituted this feast 

figured by that instrument of war the trumpet, which gives it its name, to be as a thank-offering to God the peace-maker and peace-keeper, Who destroys faction both in cities and in the various parts of the universe and creates plenty and fertility and abundance of other good things and leaves the havoc of fruits without a single spark to be rekindled.
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="193"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="32"/> The next feast held after the “Trumpets” 

is the Fast.<ref target="7-427-a"/>  Perhaps some of the perversely minded who are not ashamed to censure things excellent will say, What sort of a feast is this in which there are no gatherings to eat and drink, no company of entertainers or entertained, no copious supply of strong drink nor tables sumptuously furnished, nor a generous display of all the accompaniments of a public banquet, nor again the merriment and revelry with frolic and drollery, nor dancing to the sound of flute and harp and timbrels and cymbals, and the other instruments of the debilitated and invertebrate kind of music which through the channel of the ears awaken the unruly lusts?</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="194"><p> For it is in these and 


<pb n="429"/>


through these that men, in their ignorance of what true merriment is, consider that the merriment of a feast is to be found. This the clear-seeing eyes of Moses the ever wise discerned and therefore he called the fast a feast, the greatest of the feasts, in his native tongue a Sabbath of Sabbaths,<ref target="7-429-a"/>  or as the Greeks would say, a seven of sevens, a holier than the holy. He gave it this name for many reasons.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="195"><p>  First, because of the self-restraint which it entails; 

always and everywhere indeed he exhorted them to shew this in all the affairs of life, in controlling the tongue and the belly and the organs below the belly, but on this occasion especially he bids them do honour to it by dedicating thereto a particular day. To one who has learnt to disregard food and drink which are absolutely necessary, are there any among the superfluities of life which he can fail to despise, things which exist to promote not so much preservation and permanence of life as pleasure with all its powers of mischief?</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="196"><p>  Secondly, because 

the holy-day is entirely devoted to prayers and supplications, and men from morn to eve employ their leisure in nothing else but offering petitions of humble entreaty in which they seek earnestly to propitiate God and ask for remission of their sins, voluntary and involuntary, and entertain bright hopes looking not to their own merits but to the gracious nature of Him Who sets pardon before chastisement.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="197"><p>  Thirdly, because of the time at which the celebration 

of the fast occurs, namely, that when all the annual fruits of the earth have been gathered in. To eat and drink of these without delay would, he held, shew gluttony, but to fast and refrain from taking them as food shews the perfect piety which teaches

<pb n="431"/>


the mind not to put trust in what stands ready prepared before us as though it were the source of health and life. For often its presence proves injurious and its absence beneficial.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="198"><p> Those who abstain from food 

and drink after the ingathering of the fruits cry aloud to us with their souls, and though their voices utter no sound, their language could hardly be plainer. They say, “We have gladly received and are storing the boons of nature, yet we do not ascribe our preservation to any corruptible thing, but to God the Parent and Father and Saviour of the world and all that is therein, Who has the power and the right<ref target="7-431-a"/>  to nourish and sustain us by means of these or without these.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="199"><p> See, for example, how the many thousands 

of our forefathers as they traversed the trackless and all-barren desert, were for forty years, the life of a generation, nourished by Him as in a land of richest and most fertile soil; how He opened fountains unknown before to give them abundance of drink for their use; how He rained food from heaven, neither more nor less than what sufficed for each day, that they might consume what they needed without hoarding, nor barter for the prospect of soulless stores<ref target="7-431-b"/>  their hopes of His goodness, but taking little thought of the bounties received rather reverence and worship the bountiful Giver and honour Him with the hymns and benedictions that are His due.”</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="200"><p>  By order of the law the 

fast is held on the tenth day. Why on the tenth? As has been shewn in our detailed discussion of that



<pb n="433"/>


number,<ref target="7-433-a"/>  it is called by the learned the all-perfect, and embraces all the progressions, arithmetical, harmonic and geometrical, and further the harmonies, the fourth, the fifth, the octave and the double octave, representing respectively the ratios 4: 3, 3: 2, 2: 1 and 4: 1, and it also contains the ratio of 9:8, so that it sums up fully and perfectly the leading truths of musical science, and for this reason it has received its name of the all-perfect.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="201"><p> In ordaining 

that this privation of food and drink should be based on the full and perfect number 10, he intended to prescribe the best possible form of nourishment for the best part of us. He did not wish anyone to suppose that as their instructor in the mysteries he was advocating starvation, the most intolerable of sufferings, but only a brief stoppage in the influx which passes into the receptacles of the body.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="202"><p> For this 

would ensure that the stream from the fountain of reason should flow pure and crystal-clear with smooth course into the soul, because the constantly repeated administrations of food which submerge the body sweep the reason away as well, whereas if they are checked, that same reason stoutly fortified can in pursuit of all that is worth seeing and hearing make its way without stumbling as upon a dry firm causeway.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="203"><p> Besides, it was meet and right when every- 

thing has shewn abundance as they would have it, and they enjoy a full and perfect measure of goodness, that amid this prosperity and lavish supply of boons, they should by abstaining from food and drink remind themselves of what it is to want, and offer prayers and supplications, on the one hand to ask that they may never really experience the lack of necessities, on the other to express their thankfulness

<pb n="435"/>


because in such wealth of blessings they remember the ills they have been spared. Enough on this matter.
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="204"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="33"/> The last of the annual feasts, called 

Tabernacles, recurs at the autumn equinox.<ref target="7-435-a"/>  From this we may draw two morals. The first is, that we should honour equality and hate inequality, for the former is the source and fountain of justice, the latter of injustice. The former is akin to open sunlight, the latter to darkness. The second moral is, that after all the fruits are made perfect, it is our duty to thank God Who brought them to perfection and is the source of all good things.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="205"><p> For autumn, or after- 

fruitage, is, as also the name clearly implies, the season after the ripe fruit has been gathered in, when the sown crops and the fruit-trees have paid their annual toll and bounden tribute, and the land has richly provided all that it yields for the sustenance of the various kinds of animals without number, both tame and wild, sustenance not only to be enjoyed on the spot and for the moment, but also in the future, through the foresight of nature, the friend of all that lives. Further, the people are commanded, during 206 the time of the feast, to dwell in tents.<ref target="7-435-b"/>  The reason of this may be that the labour of the husbandmen no longer requires that they should live in the open air, as nothing is now left unprotected but all the fruits are stored in silos or similar places to escape the damage which often ensues through the blazing sunshine or storms of rain.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="207"><p> For when the crops which 

feed us are standing in the open field, you can only watch and guard the food so necessary to you, by



<pb n="437"/>


coming out and not shutting yourself up like a woman who never stirs outside her quarters. And if while you remain in the open air you encounter extreme cold or heat, you have the thick growth of the trees waiting to shade you, and sheltered under them you can easily escape injury from either source. But when all the fruits are being gathered in, come in yourself also to seek a more weatherproof mode of life and hope for rest in place of the toils which you endured when labouring on the land.<ref target="7-437-a"/> Another reason may be, that it should remind us of the long journeyings of our forefathers in the depths of the desert, when at every halting-place they spent many a year in tents.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="208"><p> And indeed it is well in wealth 

to remember your poverty, in distinction your insignificance, in high offices your position as a commoner, in peace your dangers in war, on land the storms on sea, in cities the life of loneliness. For there is no pleasure greater than in high prosperity to call to mind old misfortunes.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="209"><p> But besides giving 

pleasure, it is a considerable help in the practice of virtue. For people who having had both good and ill before their eyes have rejected the ill and are enjoying the good, necessarily fall into a grateful frame of mind and are urged to piety by the fear of a change to the reverse, and also therefore in thankfulness for their present blessings they honour God with songs and words of praise and beseech Him and propitiate Him with supplications that they may never repeat the experience of such evils.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="210"><p>  Again, the 

beginning of this feast comes on the fifteenth day of the month for the same reason as was given when


<pb n="439"/>


we were speaking<ref target="7-439-a"/>  of the season of spring,<ref target="7-439-b"/>  namely that the glorious light which nature gives should fill the universe not only by day but also by night, because on that day the sun and moon rise in succession to each other with no interval between their shining, which is not divided by any borderland of darkness.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="211"><p> As a crown to the seven days he adds an eighth,<ref target="7-439-c"/>  

which he calls the “closing,” not meaning apparently that it is the closing of that feast only, but also of all the yearly feasts which I have enumerated and described. For it is the last in the year and forms its conclusion.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="212"><p>  Perhaps also the number 

eight, the first cubic number, was assigned to the feast for the following reason: it is the beginning of the higher category of solids, marking where we pass from the unsubstantial and bring to its conclusion the category of the conceptual which rises to the solid in the scale of ascending powers.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="213"><p><ref target="7-439-d"/>  And indeed the 

autumn festival, being as I have said a sort of complement<ref target="7-439-e"/>  and conclusion of all the feasts in the year,



<pb n="441"/>


seems to have more stability and fixity, because the people have now received their returns from the land and are no longer perplexed and terrified by doubts as to its fertility or barrenness. For the anxious thoughts of the husbandman are never settled till the crops are gathered in, so numberless are the men and animals from whom they are liable to suffer harm.
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="214"><p><milestone unit="para"/>All this long exposition is due to my regard for the 

sacred seventh day, and my wish to shew that all the yearly feasts prove to be as it were the children of that number which stands as a mother . . . scenes of folly and joy . . . and because the festal assemblies and the cheerful life which they afford bring delights that are free from all anxiety and dejection, and spread exhilaration both in the body and in the soul, in the body by the comfortable way of living, in the soul by the study of philosophy.
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="215"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="34"/><ref target="7-441-a"/> But besides these we have what is not a 

feast, but is a general ceremony of a festal character called the Basket, a name which describes what takes place, as we shall shortly shew.<ref target="7-441-b"/>  That it has not the prestige and standing of a feast is clear for many







<pb n="443"/>


reasons. For it does not affect the nation as a united whole like each of the others, nor do we find any victim being brought or led to the altar and then sacrificed and given over to be consumed by the sacred and unquenchable fire, nor is there any specified number of days during which the feast is to last.
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="216"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="35"/> But that it has a festal character and nearly 

approaches the form of a general ceremony<ref target="7-443-a"/>  can be easily seen. For every person who possesses farms or landed estates takes some of every kind of fruit and fills receptacles which, as I have said, are called baskets, and brings them with joy as a sample offering of his rich fruit-harvest, to the temple, and there standing opposite the altar, gives them to the priest. Meanwhile he recites this beautiful and admirable canticle, or if he does not remember it, he listens with all attention while the priest repeats it.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="217"><p> The 

sense of this canticle is as follows: “The founders of our race abandoned Syria and migrated to Egypt and, though few in number, increased to a populous nation. Their descendants suffered wrongs without number from the inhabitants, and when no further assistance from men appeared forthcoming, became suppliants of God and sought refuge in His help.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="218"><p> He 

Who is kindly to all the wronged accepted their supplication and confounded their assailants with signs and wonders and portents and all the other marvels that were wrought at that time, and saved the victims of outrage who were suffering all that malice could devise, and not only brought them forth





<pb n="445"/>


into freedom, but gave them a land fertile in every way.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="219"><p> Of the fruits of this land we present a sample 

offering to Thee, our Benefactor, if indeed we may speak of presenting that which we receive. For all these things, good Master, are Thy boons and gifts, and as Thou hast judged us worthy of them, we take pride and delight in the unexpected blessings which Thou hast given us beyond all our hopes.”</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="220"><p> 


<milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="36"/> This canticle is used continually by a succession of worshippers from early summer to late autumn, through the two seasons which constitute a complete half of the year. For the whole population cannot in a body bring the fruits of the season at a fixed time, but must do so at different times, and this may even be the case with the same persons coming from the same places.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="221"><p><ref target="7-445-a"/>  For since some of the fruits 

ripen more quickly than others, both because of the difference of the situation which may be warmer or colder, and for a multitude of other reasons, naturally the time when this sample of the fruits is due cannot be exactly defined or limited, but extends over a very considerable period.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="222"><p> These offerings 

are assigned for the use of the priests, because they have no territory allotted to them, nor property which brings them income, and their heritage consists of the offerings of the nation in return for the religious duties imposed upon them by night and day.
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="223"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="37"/> I have now completed the discussion of 

the number seven and of matters connected with days and months and years that have reference to that number, and also of the feasts which are associated


<pb n="447"/>


ated with it. In this I have followed the order of the principal heads set before us as the sequence of the subjects demanded. I now proceed to the next head, in which we find recorded a statement of the honour due to parents.
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="224"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="38"/><ref target="7-447-a"/> In my previous remarks I have sketched 

the four divisions which both in order and importance stand undoubtedly first. They comprise the assertion of the absolute sovereignty by which the universe is governed, the prohibition against making any image or likeness of God and against perjury or vain swearing in general and the doctrine of the sacred seventh day, all of them tending to promote piety and religion. I now proceed to the fifth, which states the duty of honouring parents, a matter which, as I have shewn in the discussion devoted to this in particular,<ref target="7-447-b"/>  stands on the border-line between the human and the divine.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="225"><p> For parents are midway between 

the natures of God and man, and partake of both; the human obviously because they have been born and will perish, the divine because they have brought others to the birth and have raised not-being into being. Parents, in my opinion, are to their children what God is to the world, since just as He achieved existence for the non-existent, so they in imitation of His power, as far as they are capable, immortalize the race.
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="226"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="39"/> And a father and mother de- 

serve honour, not only on this account, but for many other reasons. For in the judgement of those who take account of virtue, seniors are placed above juniors, teachers above pupils, benefactors above beneficiaries, rulers above subjects, and masters above servants.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="227"><p> Now parents are assigned a place 

in the higher of these two orders, for they are seniors

<pb n="449"/>


and instructors and benefactors and rulers and masters: sons and daughters are placed in the lower order, for they are juniors and learners and recipients of benefits and subjects and servants.  That none of these statements is false is self-evident, but logical proofs will ratify their truth still further.
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="228"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="40"/> I say, then, that the maker is always senior to the 

thing made and the cause to its effect, and the begetters are in a sense the causes and the creators of what they beget. They are also in the position of instructors because they impart to their children from their earliest years everything that they themselves may happen to know, and give them instruction not only in the various branches of knowledge which they impress upon their young minds,<ref target="7-449-a"/>  but also on the most essential questions of what to choose and avoid, namely, to choose virtues and avoid vices and the activities to which they lead.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="229"><p>  Further, who could be more truly called benefactors 

than parents in relation to their children? First, they have brought them out of non-existence;<ref target="7-449-b"/>  then, again, they have held them entitled to nurture and later to education of body and soul, so that they may have not only life, but a good life.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="230"><p> They have 


<pb n="451"/>


benefited the body by means of the gymnasium and the training there given, through which it gains muscular vigour and good condition and the power to bear itself and move with an ease marked by gracefulness and elegance. They have done the same for the soul by means of letters<ref target="7-451-a"/>  and arithmetic and geometry and music and philosophy as a whole which lifts on high the mind lodged within the mortal body and escorts it to the very heaven and shews it the blessed and happy beings that dwell therein, and creates in it an eager longing for the unswerving ever-harmonious order which they never forsake because they obey their captain and marshal.  But in addition to the benefits they confer, parents have also received authority over their offspring. That authority is not obtained by lot nor voting as it is in the cities, where it may be alleged that the lot is due to a blunder of fortune in which reason has no place, and the voting to the impetuosity of the mob, always so reckless and devoid of circumspection, but is awarded by the most admirable and perfect judgement of nature above us which governs with justice things both human and divine.
<milestone unit="para"/>XLΙ. And therefore fathers have the right to upbraid their children and admonish them severely and if they do not submit to threats conveyed in words to beat and degrade them<ref target="7-451-b"/>  and put them in bonds. And further if in the face of this they continue to rebel, and carried away by their incorrigible depravity refuse the yoke, the law permits the parents to extend the punishment to death, though here it requires more than the father alone or


<pb n="453"/>


the mother alone.<ref target="7-453-a"/>  So great a penalty should be the sentence, not only of one of them but of both. For it is not to be expected that both the parents would agree to the execution of their son unless the weight of his offences depressed the scale strongly enough to overcome the affection which nature has firmly established in them.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="233"><p>  But parents have 

not only been given the right of exercising authority over their children, but the power of a master corresponding to the two primary<ref target="7-453-b"/>  forms under which servants are owned, one when they are home-bred, the other when they are purchased. For parents pay out a sum many times the value of a slave on their children and for them to nurses, tutors and teachers, apart from the cost of their clothes, food and superintendence in sickness and health from their earliest years until they are full grown. “Homebred” too must they be who are not only born in the house but through the masters of the house, who have made the contribution enforced by the statutes of nature in giving them birth.<ref target="7-453-c"/> 
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="234"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="42"/> With 

all these facts before them, they do not do anything deserving of praise who honour their parents, since any one of the considerations mentioned is in itself quite a sufficient call to shew reverence. And on the contrary, they deserve blame and obloquy and extreme punishment who do not respect them as seniors nor listen to them as instructors nor feel the duty of requiting them as benefactors nor obey them as rulers nor fear them as masters.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="235"><p> Honour therefore, 

he says, next to God thy father and thy mother,



<pb n="455"/>


who are crowned with a laurel of the second rank assigned to them by nature, the arbitress of the contest. And in no way wilt thou honour them as well as by trying both to be good and to seem good, to be good by seeking virtue simple and unfeigned, to seem good by seeking it accompanied by a reputation for worth and the praise of those around you.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="236"><p> For 

parents have little thought for their own personal interests and find the consummation of happiness in the high excellence of their children, and to gain this the children will be willing to hearken to their commands and to obey them in everything that is just and profitable; for the true father will give no instruction to his son that is foreign to virtue.
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="237"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="43"/> But the proof of filial piety may be given 

not only in the ways above mentioned, but also by courtesy shewn to persons who share the seniority of the parents. One who pays respect to an aged man or woman who is not of his kin may be regarded as having remembrance of his father and mother. He looks to them as prototypes and stands in awe of those who bear their image.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="238"><p> And therefore in the 

Holy Scriptures the young are commanded not only to yield the chief seats to the aged but also to give place to them as they pass,<ref target="7-455-a"/>  in reverence for the grey hairs that mark the age to which they may hope to attain who judge it worthy of precedence.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="239"><p> Admirable 

too, as it seems to me, is that other ordinance where he says, “Let each fear his father and mother.”<ref target="7-455-b"/> 

<pb n="457"/>


Here he sets fear before affection, not as better in every way, but as more serviceable and profitable for the occasion which he has before him. For in the first place, persons subject to instruction and admonition are in fact wanting in sense, and want of sense is only cured by fear. Secondly, it would not be suitable to include in the enactments of a lawgiver an instruction on the duty of filial affection, for nature has implanted this as an imperative instinct from the very cradle in the souls of those who are thus united by kinship.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="240"><p><ref target="7-457-a"/>  And therefore he omitted any mention 

of love for parents because it is learned and taught by instinct and requires no injunction, but did enjoin fear for the sake of those who are in the habit of neglecting their duty. For when parents cherish their children with extreme tenderness, providing them with good gifts from every quarter and shunning no toil or danger because they are fast bound to them by the magnetic forces of affection, there are some who do not receive this exceeding tenderheartedness in a way that profits them. They pursue eagerly luxury and voluptuousness, they applaud the dissolute life, they run to waste both in body and soul, and suffer no part of either to be kept erect by its proper faculties which they lay prostrate and paralyzed without a blush because they have never feared the censors they possess in their fathers and mothers but give in to and indulge their own lusts.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="241"><p> But these 

parents also must be exhorted to employ more active and severe admonitions to cure the wastage of their children, and the children also that they may stand


<pb n="459"/>


in awe of those who begot them, fearing them both as rulers and masters. For only so, and that hardly, will they shrink from wrongdoing.
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="242"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="44"/> I have now discussed the five heads of the 

laws belonging to the first table, and all the particular enactments which may be classed under each of the five. But I must also state the penalties decreed for transgression of them.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="243"><p> The result of 

the close affinity which the offences have to each other is that they all have a common punishment, namely, death, but there are different reasons for this punishment. We should begin with the last commandment, on the behaviour due to parents, since our discussion of it is fresh in our minds. He says “if anyone strikes his father or mother, let him be stoned.”<ref target="7-459-a"/>  This is quite just, for justice forbids that he should live who maltreats the authors of his life.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="244"><p> But some dignitaries and legislators who had 

an eye to men’s opinions rather than to truth, have decreed that striking a father should be punished by cutting off the hands, a specious refinement<ref target="7-459-b"/>  due to their wish to win the approval of the more careless or thoughtless, who think that the parts with which the offenders have struck their parents should be amputated.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="245"><p><ref target="7-459-c"/>  But it is silly to visit displeasure on the 

servants rather than on the actual authors, for the



<pb n="461"/>


outrage is not committed by the hands but by the persons who used their hands to commit it, and it is these persons who must be punished. Otherwise, when one man has killed another with a sword, we should cast the sword out of the land and let the murderer go free, and conversely, honour should be given, not to those who have distinguished themselves in war, but to the lifeless equipments and weapons which were the instruments of their exploits.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="246"><p> In the case of the victors in the athletic contests, 

whether at the single or the double course or the long race or the boxing or the general contest, will they try to garland the legs and hands only and disregard the bodies of the athletes as a whole? It would surely be ridiculous to introduce such practices and give to the indispensable accompaniments the punishments or honours which should be given to the responsible persons. For similarly, in musical exhibitions, when anyone makes a highly successful performance on the flute or lyre, we do not pass him by and adjudge the laudatory announcements and honours to the instruments.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="247"><p> Why then, you 

grand legislators, should we cut off the hands of those who strike a father? Or is your object that the offenders, besides being quite useless, may levy a tribute not annually, but daily, on those whom they have wronged, because they are unable to provide the sustenance they need. For no father is so iron-hearted as to allow his son to starve to death, particularly as his anger grows faint as time goes on.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="248"><p> And even if while making no assault with his hands 

he uses abusive language to those to whom good words are owed as a bounden duty, or in any other way does anything to dishonour his parents, let him die.<ref target="7-461-a"/>  He

<pb n="463"/>


is the common and indeed the national enemy of all. For who could find kindness from him who is not kind even to the authors of his life, through whom he has come into existence and to whom he is but a supplement?
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="249"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="45"/> Again, let him who has turned the sacred 

seventh day into a profane thing, as far as lies in his power, be sentenced to death.<ref target="7-463-a"/>  For on the contrary we ought to be rich in ways of purifying things profane, both material and immaterial,<ref target="7-463-b"/>  to change them for the better, since, as it has been said, “envy has no place in the divine choir.”<ref target="7-463-c"/>  But to dare to debase and deface the stamp of things consecrated shews the utmost height of impiety.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="250"><p> There is an incident 

which occurred during the great migration from Egypt in ancient days while the whole multitude was journeying through the pathless wilderness.<ref target="7-463-d"/>  The seventh day had come, and all those myriads, how numerous I have stated in an earlier place,<ref target="7-463-e"/>  were staying very quietly in their tents, when a single person of a rank by no means mean or insignificant,<ref target="7-463-f"/>  regardless of the orders given and mocking at those who maintained them, went out to gather firewood, but actually succeeded<ref target="7-463-g"/>  in displaying his disobedience to the law.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="251"><p> He returned bringing an armful, 


<pb n="465"/>


but the others, pouring out from the tents,<ref target="7-465-a"/>  though greatly enraged refrained from violence on account of the sanctity of the day, but took him to the ruler and reported the impious deed. The ruler put him in custody, but when the divine pronouncement had been given out that he should be stoned, he surrendered him to those who had first seen him<ref target="7-465-b"/>  to be done to death. For the prohibition against lighting a fire on the seventh day, the reason for which I have stated earlier,<ref target="7-465-c"/>  applies equally, I presume, to collecting the means for kindling fire.
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="252"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="46"/> For persons who call God to witness to an 

untruth, death is the appointed punishment,<ref target="7-465-d"/>  quite rightly. For not even a man, if he is of a decent sort, will tolerate an invitation to join in subscribing to an untruth, but would in my opinion regard anyone who urged him to this course as an enemy unfit to be trusted.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="253"><p> And therefore we must declare that God, 

though His nature is to be merciful, will never free from guilt him who swears falsely<ref target="7-465-e"/>  to an injustice, a miscreant almost beyond possibility of purification, even if he evades the chastisements of men. And these he will never escape; for there are thousands who have their eyes upon him full of zeal for the laws, strictest guardians of the ancestral institutions,



<pb n="467"/>


merciless to those who do anything to subvert them. Otherwise we must suppose that while it is right to seek the death of one who dishonours a father or a mother, more moderation should be shewn when impious men dishonour the name which is more glorious than majesty itself.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="254"><p> Yet none is so foolish 

as to visit the lesser offences with death and spare those who are guilty of the greater; and the sacrilege involved in reviling or outraging parents is not so great as that committed by perjury against the sacred title of God.
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="255"><p><milestone unit="para"/>But if he who swears a wrongful oath is guilty, how 

great a punishment<ref target="7-467-a"/>  does he deserve who denies the truly existing God and honours created beings before their Maker, and thinks fit to revere, not only earth or water or air or fire, the elements of the All, or again the sun and moon and planets and fixed stars, or the whole heaven and universe, but also the works of mortal craftsmen, stocks and stones, which they have fashioned into human shape?</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="256"><p> And therefore 

let him too himself be made like unto these works of men’s hands. For it is right that he who honours lifeless things should have no part in life, especially if he has become a disciple of Moses and has often heard from his prophetic<ref target="7-467-b"/>  lips those most holy and godly instructions,



<pb n="469"/>


“Do not admit the name of other gods into thy soul to remember it,<ref target="7-469-a"/>  nor give expression to it with thy voice. Keep both thy mind and thy speech far apart from these others, and turn to the Father and Maker of all, that thy conceptions of His sole sovereignty may be the best and the noblest, and thy words such as are suitable and most profitable to thyself and to them that shall hear thee.”
<milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="47"/> We have now explained the punishments inflicted on those who transgress the five oracles.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="258"><p> But the guerdons awaiting those who keep them, even if not stated by the law in actual words of the 

injunctions, yet may be seen to underlie them. The refusal to acknowledge other gods, or to deify the works of men’s hands, or to commit perjury, needs no other reward. For surely the practice of such abstinence is in itself the best and most perfect reward.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="259"><p> For where can any lover of truth find greater pleasure than by devoting himself to the one God and embracing his service in guilelessness and 

purity? I call to witness not such as serve vanity but those who are inspired with a zeal which never goes astray, those among whom truth is honoured. For wisdom is itself the guerdon of wisdom, and justice and each of the other virtues is its own reward.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="260"><p><ref target="7-469-b"/>  And much more is she, who as in a choir is the fairest and the queen of the dance—religion<ref target="7-469-c"/> —her own prize and guerdon, providing happiness to those who cherish her and to their children and children’s children blessings of welfare which can never be 

taken from them.
<milestone unit="para"/>XLVIII Again, the experience of those who keep the seventh day is that



<pb n="471"/>


both body and soul are benefited in two most essential ways. The body is benefited by the recurrence of respite from continuous and wearisome toil, the soul by the excellent conceptions which it receives of God as the world-maker and guardian of what He has begotten. For He brought all things to their completion on the seventh day. These things shew clearly that he who gives due value<ref target="7-471-a"/>  to the seventh day gains value<ref target="7-471-a"/>  for himself.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="261"><p> So too indeed he who 

shews respect to his parents should not seek anything further, for if he look he will find his guerdon in the action itself. However, since this commandment, inasmuch as it is concerned with mortal things, is inferior to the first four heads whose province is nearer the divine, He gave encouragement with the words, “Honour thy father and thy mother, that it may be well with thee and that thy time may be long.”</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="262"><p> Here He names two rewards: one is the possession 

of virtue, for “well” is virtue or cannot exist without virtue, the other in very truth is salvation from death given by prolonged vitality and agelong life which thou wilt keep thriving even while in the body, if thou live with a soul purged clean of all impurity.
<milestone unit="para"/>This part of the subject has now been sufficiently discussed. We will proceed in due season<ref target="7-471-b"/>  to examine the contents of the second table.

</p></div></div>

<pb n="475"/>
<div type="textpart" subtype="book" n="3">
<head>On the particular laws which come under two of the ten general commandments, namely the sixth against adulterers and all licentiousness and the seventh against murderers and all violence.</head>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="1"><milestone unit="altchapter" n="1"/><p>
There was a time when I had leisure for philosophy  and for the contemplation of the universe and its contents, when I made its spirit<ref target="7-475-a"/> my own in all its beauty and loveliness and true blessedness, when my constant companions were divine themes and verities, wherein I rejoiced with a joy that never cloyed or sated. I had no base or abject thoughts nor grovelled<ref target="7-475-b"/> in search of reputation or of wealth or bodily comforts, but seemed always to be borne aloft into the heights with a soul possessed by some God-sent inspiration, a fellow-traveller with the sun and moon and the whole heaven and universe. 
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="2"><p>
Ah then I gazed down from the upper air, and straining the mind's eye beheld, as from some commanding peak, the multitudinous world-wide spectacles of earthly things, and blessed my lot in that I had escaped by main force

<pb n="477"/>


from the plagues of mortal life.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="3"><p> But, as it proved, my 

steps were dogged by the deadliest of mischiefs, the hater of the good, envy, which suddenly set upon me and ceased not to pull me down with violence till it had plunged me in the ocean of civil cares,<ref target="7-477-a"/>  in which I am swept away, unable even to raise my head above the water.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="4"><p> Yet amid my groans I hold my own, for, 

planted in my soul from my earliest days I keep the yearning for culture which ever has pity and compassion for me, lifts me up and relieves my pain. To this I owe it that sometimes I raise my head and with the soul’s eyes—dimly indeed because the mist of extraneous affairs has clouded their clear vision—I yet make shift<ref target="7-477-b"/>  to look around me in my desire to inhale a breath of life pure and unmixed with evil.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="5"><p> And if unexpectedly I obtain a spell of fine weather 

and a calm from civil turmoils, I get me wings and ride the waves and almost tread the lower air, wafted by the breezes of knowledge which often urges me to come to spend my days with her, a truant as it were from merciless masters in the shape not only of men but of affairs, which pour in upon me like a torrent from different sides.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="6"><p> Yet it is well for me to give 

thanks to God even for this,<ref target="7-477-c"/>  that though submerged I am not sucked down into the depths, but can also open the soul’s eyes, which in my despair of comforting hope I thought had now lost their sight, and am irradiated by the light of wisdom, and am not given over to lifelong darkness. So behold me



<pb n="479"/>


daring, not only to read the sacred messages of Moses, but also in my love of knowledge to peer into each of them and unfold and reveal what is not known to the multitude.
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="7"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="2"/> Since out of the ten oracles which God gave 

forth Himself without a spokesman or interpreter, we have spoken of five, namely those graven on the first table, and also of all the particular laws which had reference to these, and our present duty is to couple with them those of the second table as well as we can, I will again endeavour to fit the special laws into each of the heads.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="8"><p> The first<ref target="7-479-a"/>  commandment in 

the second table is “Thou shalt not commit adultery.” It comes first, I think, because pleasure is a mighty force felt throughout the whole inhabited world, no part of which has escaped its domination, neither the denizens of land nor of sea nor of the air, for in all three elements beasts, fowls and fishes all alike treat her with profound respect and deference and submit to her orders, look to her every glance or nod, accept contentedly even the caprices of her arrogance and almost anticipate her commands, so promptly and instantaneously do they hasten to render their services.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="9"><p> Now even natural pleasure is often greatly 

to blame when the craving for it is immoderate and insatiable, as for instance when it takes the form of voracious gluttony, even though none of the food taken is of the forbidden kind, or again the passionate desire for women shewn by those who in their craze for sexual intercourse behave unchastely, not with the wives of others, but with their own.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="10"><p> But the 

blame in most of these cases rests less with the soul


<pb n="481"/>


than with the body, which contains a great amount both of fire and of moisture; the fire as it consumes the material set before it quickly demands a second supply; the moisture is sluiced in a stream through the genital organs, and creates in them irritations, itchings and titillations without ceasing.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="11"><p> It is not so with men who are mad to possess the 

wives of others, sometimes those of their relations and friends, who live to work havoc among their neighbours, who go about to bastardize wholesale widespread family connexions, to turn their prayers for married happiness into a curse and render their hopes of offspring fruitless. Here it is the soul which is incurably diseased. Such persons must be punished with death<ref target="7-481-a"/>  as the common enemies of the whole human race, that they may not live to ruin more houses with immunity and be the tutors of others who make it their business to emulate the wickedness of their ways.

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="13"><p> To the Persian 

custom it at once shows its aversion and abhorrence and forbids it as a very grave offence against holy living.<ref target="7-481-d"/>  For the Persian magnates marry their

mothers and regard the children of the marriage as nobles of the highest birth, worthy, so it is said, to hold the supreme sovereignty.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="14"><p> What form of unholiness 

could be more impious than this: that a father’s bed, which should be kept untouched as something sacred, should be brought to shame: that no respect should be shown for a mother’s ageing years: that the same man should be son and husband to the same woman, and again the same woman wife and mother to the same man: that the children of both should be brothers to their father and grandsons to their mother: that she should be both mother and grandmother of those whom she bore and he both father and half-brother of those whom he begot?</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="15"><p> Even, among the Greeks these things 

were done in old days in Thebes in the case of Oedipus the son of Laïus. They were done in ignorance, not by deliberate intention, and yet the marriage produced such a harvest of ills that nothing was wanting that could lead to the utmost misery.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="16"><p> For a succession 

of wars civil and foreign was left to be passed on as a heritage to children and descendants from their fathers and ancestors.<ref target="7-483-a"/>  The greatest cities in Greece were sacked, and armed forces both of natives and allied contingents were destroyed: after the other; brothers slew brothers in the deadly feud engendered by


<pb n="485"/>


ambition for sovereign power. In consequence not only families and independent territories, but also the largest part of the Greek world perished involved in the general destruction. For cities formerly well populated were left stripped of their inhabitants as monuments of the disasters of Greece, a sinister sight to contemplate.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="17"><p> Nor are the Persians 

either who follow these practices exempt from similar troubles, for they are always engaging in campaigns and battles, slaying and being slain.<ref target="7-485-a"/>  Sometimes they are attacking the neighbouring populations, sometimes defending themselves against insurrection. For of insurgents many appear from many quarters, as the barbarian nature can never remain in quietude. Thus before the sedition of the hour is put down another springs up, so that no season of the year is reserved for a tranquil life, but summer and winter, day and night they are bearing arms, and so rarely does peace reign that they spend more time enduring the hardships of encampment in the open air than dwelling in their cities.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="18"><p> I put on one side the great 

and magnificent triumphs of kings whose first exploit when they succeed to the throne is that worst of sacrileges fratricide—murders which they try to vindicate as reasonable by predicting that their brothers will probably attack them.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="19"><p> All these things 

appear to me to be the result of the ill-matched matings of sons with mothers. For justice who watches over human affairs avenges the unholy deeds on the impious, and the impiety extends beyond the perpetrators of the deed to those who voluntarily range themselves with the perpetrators.</p></div>

a sister, a very excellent rule tending to promote both continence and outward decency.<ref target="7-487-c"/>  Now Solon the lawgiver of the Athenians permitted marriage with half-sisters on the father’s side but prohibited it when the mother was the same.<ref target="7-487-d"/>  The lawgiver of the Lacedaemonians, on the other hand, allowed the second but forbade the first.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="23"><p> But the lawgiver

to both, and not only if they were younger than their brothers but also if they were older or of the same age.<ref target="7-489-a"/>  For twins are often born who, although separated and disunited by nature at birth, enter at the call of concupiscence and voluptuousness into a partnership and wedlock which are neither in the true sense of the words.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="24"><p> These practices our most

widow or unmarried, I need not say while the wife is alive, heaven forbid, but even after her death. For the stepfather is virtually a father whose duty is to set his wife’s daughter in the same position as his own.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="27"><p> Again, he does not allow the same man to 

marry two sisters either at the same or at different times, even if the person in question has repudiated the one he married first.<ref target="7-491-a"/>  For while she is still alive either as his consort or divorced,<ref target="7-491-b"/>  whether she is remaining in widowhood or has married another, he considered that the law of holiness required that the sister should not take the position which the wife has lost by her misfortune, but should learn not to set at nought the rights of kinship, nor use as a stepping-stone the fallen state of one so closely united to her by birth, nor bask at ease while enjoying and returning the caresses of her sister’s enemies.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="28"><p> For from this source grow grave jealousies and bitter

do not enter into the partnership of marriage with a member of a foreign nation, lest some day conquered by the forces of opposing customs you surrender and stray unawares from the path that leads to piety and turn aside into a pathless wild. And though perhaps you yourself will hold your ground steadied from your earliest years by the admirable instructions instilled into you by your parents, with the holy laws always as their key-note, there is much to be feared for your sons and daughters. It may well be that they, enticed by spurious customs which they prefer to the genuine, are likely to unlearn the honour due to the one God, and that is the first and the last stage of supreme misery.

Mark how conspicuously they braid and adorn the hair of their heads, and how they scrub and paint their faces with cosmetics and pigments and the like, and smother themselves with fragrant unguents. For of all such embellishments, used by all who deck themselves out to wear a comely appearance, fragrance is the most seductive.

bull, but had no hope of obtaining its company. Consequently wild with passion, for amorousness is vastly intensified by unsuccess, she reported the trouble under which she was labouring to Daedalus, who was the best craftsman of his time. His masterly skill in devising plans for capturing the uncaptured enabled him to construct a wooden cow, into which he introduced Pasiphaë through one of its sides, and the bull supposing it to be a living animal of its own kind, charged and mounted it.

But Moses, recognizing that the way in which this animal is produced contravenes nature, stringently forbade it under the wider order by which he refused permission for animals of either sex to breed with those of an unlike species.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="48"><p><ref target="7-505-b"/>  In making this

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="53"><p><ref target="7-509-a"/> So the 

law says to the husband who suspects his wife, “Draw up a formal challenge and come to the holy city with your wife and standing before the judges lay bare the suspicion which troubles you, not in the spirit of a false accuser or malicious schemer, set on winning at any cost, but of one who would strictly test the truth without sophistry.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="54"><p> The woman who is threatened with two dangers, 

one of losing her life, the other of bringing shame on her past (and this is a thing far more grievous than death), must judge the matter in her heart, and if she is pure, plead her cause with good courage, but if her conscience convicts her, make her submission and use her ashamedness to palliate her sins.

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="57"><p><ref target="7-511-b"/>  The meal used 

is of barley, perhaps because as a foodstuff it is of somewhat doubtful merit, suited for irrational animals and men in unhappy circumstances, and thus is a symbol that the adulteress is quite on a par with wild beasts, which copulate without discrimination or due consideration, while the wife who is innocent of the charges brought against her has emulated the life which is fitted to human beings.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="58"><p> The priest, it

The act of adultery is signified by the earthen vessel because of its fragility, since death is the punishment decreed for adulterers; innocence of the charge by the earth and water, since both these are factors in the birth and growth and consummation of all things.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="59"><p> And 

therefore the terms used in both cases make an

appropriate addition to the picture.

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="60"><p> When these preliminaries are completed, 

the woman is to come forward with her head uncovered, bringing the barley-meal, as has been said, and the priest holding the earthen vessel with the earth and water in it stands fronting her and pronounces as follows:</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="61"><p> “If thou hast not transgressed 

the lawful usages of marriage, if no other man has had intercourse with thee, suffered by thee in abandonment of thy duties to the legitimate partner of thy home, be clear of guilt and its consequences. But if thou hast set at naught thy husband and eagerly gratified thy new desires, seized with love for another or surrendering to his love, betraying and debasing the closest and fondest ties, be well assured that thou hast laid thyself open to every curse, and the signs of their fulfilment thou wilt exhibit in thy body.

then write these words on a piece of paper and after blotting them out in the water in the vessel, proffer it to the woman, and when she has drunk she will depart expecting either reward for her chastity or extreme punishment for her incontinence.

apprehensions of sterility or childlessness. But if she is guilty she may be sure that the fate awaiting her is an unwieldy belly, swollen and inflamed, and terrible suffering all round the womb, which she has not cared to keep pure for the husband who married her according to ancestral custom.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="63"><p> So careful is the

And therefore the law in defending the case of a woman deflowered in a solitude is careful to add the very excellent proviso: “The damsel cried out and there was none to help her;” so that if she neither cried out nor resisted but co-operated willingly, she will be found guilty, and her use of the place as an excuse is merely a device to make it seem that she was forced.</p></div>

If he should bind her with the help of others<ref target="7-523-a"/>  and gag her mouth so that she could not utter a sound, what help could she get from the neighbours? In a sense such a one, though living in a city, is in a solitude, being solitary so far as helpers are concerned. The other, even if no one was present to help, may be said, in view of her willing cooperation, to be in exactly the same position as the offender in the town.

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="97"><p> For

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="111"><p> For if

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="112"><p> If 

the guardians of the children cut them off from these blessings, if at their very birth they deny them all share in them, they must rest assured that they are breaking the laws of Nature and stand self-condemned on the gravest charges, love of pleasure, hatred of men, murder and, the worst abomination of all, murder of their own children.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="113"><p> For they are pleasure-lovers 

when they mate with their wives, not to procreate children and perpetuate the race, but like pigs and goats in quest of the enjoyment which such intercourse gives.

For no one is so foolish as to suppose that those who have treated dishonourably their own flesh and blood will deal honourably with strangers.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="114"><p> As to the charges of murder in general 

and murder of their own children in particular the clearest proofs of their truth is supplied by the parents. Some of them do the deed with their own hands; with monstrous cruelty and barbarity they stifle and throttle the first breath which the infants draw or throw them into a river or into the depths of the sea, after attaching some heavy substance to make them sink more quickly under its weight.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="115"><p> Others 

take them to be exposed in some desert place, hoping, they themselves say, that they may be saved, but leaving them in actual truth to suffer the most distressing fate. For all the beasts that feed on human

Carnivorous birds, too, come flying down and gobble up the fragments, that is, if they have not discovered them earlier, for, if they have, they get ready to fight the beasts of the field for the whole carcase.</p></div>

Do we not consider that those who brought them into the world stand condemned when strangers play the part of parents, and parents do not behave with even the kindness of strangers?
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="117"><p><milestone unit="para"/>So Moses then, as I have said, implicitly and indirectly 

forbade the exposure of children, when he pronounced the sentence of death against those who cause the miscarriage of mothers in cases where the foetus is fully formed. No doubt the view that the child while still adhering to the womb below the belly is part of its future mother is current both among natural philosophers whose life study is concerned with the theoretical side of knowledge and also among physicians of the highest repute, who have made researches into the construction of man and examined in detail what is visible and also by the careful use of anatomy what is hidden from sight, in order that if medical treatment is required nothing which could cause serious danger

should be neglected through ignorance.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="118"><p> But when 

the child has been brought to the birth it is separated from the organism with which it was identified and being isolated and self-contained becomes a living animal, lacking none of the complements needed to make a human being.<ref target="7-551-a"/>  And therefore infanticide undoubtedly is murder, since the displeasure of the law is not concerned with ages but with a breach of faith to the race.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="119"><p> Though indeed, if 

age had to be taken into consideration, infanticide to my mind gives a greater cause for indignation, for in the case of adults quarrels and differences supply any number of reasonable pretexts, but with mere babes, who have just passed into the light and the life of human kind, not even a false charge can be brought against such absolute innocence. Therefore those who gird themselves up to conspire against such as these must be judged to be the cruellest and most ruthless of men. The holy law detests them and has pronounced them worthy of punishment.
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="120"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="21"/> The holy law describes the man who has been

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="121"><p> For it assumes that a merciful and forgiving 

God would never surrender an innocent man to be done to death but only one who having been enabled by his resourcefulness to make a skilful escape from the justice of men has been arraigned and condemned in the invisible court of Nature, that court in which


<pb n="553"/>


truth is seen in perfect purity, which is not beclouded by verbal artifices, since it never accepts words at all but unveils motives and brings hidden intentions into open daylight. Partly, too, it lays the manslayer under the imputation, not indeed of murder, since he is held to have been the minister of divine judgement, but of a defilement of little note and quite insignificant, for which pardon may well be asked and granted.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="122"><p><ref target="7-553-a"/>  For in inflicting chastisement on 

offenders whose deeds have been evil beyond all remedy God uses as His ministers those whose sins are few and easily remedied, though He does not show approval of them but merely takes them as suitable instruments of vengeance. For He would not wish that anyone whose whole life is stainless and his lineage also should set his hand to homicide however justly deserved.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="123"><p> He therefore sentenced the 

involuntary manslayer to go into exile, but not just anywhere nor yet for all time. For He assigned to persons convicted under this head six cities, an eighth part of those allotted to the consecrated tribe,<ref target="7-553-b"/>  a fact recorded in the name of “cities of refuge” which He gave to them, and by a further edict He limited the time of banishment to the life of the high priest, after whose death the exile should be permitted to return.<ref target="7-553-c"/> 
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="124"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="22"/><ref target="7-553-d"/> The first reason for this is as 

follows: the aforesaid tribe received the cities as a reward for a righteous slaughter which we must regard as the most illustrious act of heroism that has




<pb n="555"/>


ever been achieved.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="125"><p> When the prophet, summoned 

up to the highest and most sacred mountain in that region, was receiving<ref target="7-555-a"/>  from God the heads which sum up the particular laws, and had disappeared for several days, the born enemies of peace had diffused through every part of the camp the vices that spring up in the ruler’s absence and had crowned them with impiety. They mocked at the most excellent and admirable injunctions which bade them honour the truly existing God, constructed a golden bull in imitation of the vanity of Egypt, offered sacrifices which were no sacrifices, held feasts which were no feasts and danced dances of death with songs and hymns which should have been dirges.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="126"><p><ref target="7-555-b"/>  Then this 

same tribe, sorely distressed at the sudden backsliding and fired with zeal by their heart-felt hatred of evil, every man of them filled with rage, frenzied, possessed, took arms as if at one signal,<ref target="7-555-c"/>  and despising all thoughts of danger mowed down their foes drunk with the twofold intoxication of impiety and wine. They began with their nearest and dearest, for they acknowledged no love nor kinship but God’s love, and in the space of a few hours 24,000<ref target="7-555-d"/>  had fallen whose fate served as a warning through fear that they might suffer the like to those who were on the brink of sharing their delusion.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="127"><p> This campaign, waged spontaneously 

and instinctively on behalf of piety and




<pb n="557"/>


holiness towards the truly existing God and fraught with much danger to those who undertook it, was approved by none other than the Father of all Who took it upon Himself to judge the cause of those who wrought the slaughter, declared them pure from any curse of bloodguiltiness and gave them the priesthood as a reward for their gallantry.
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="128"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="23"/> So then he bids the unintentional homicide 

flee to some of the cities allotted to this tribe, there to gain consolation and be saved from despairing of salvation altogether. There the place will remind him of the fearless courage once shewn in the past; there he may reflect that those who shed blood intentionally received not only full pardon but also rewards great and much to be desired and fraught with abundant happiness; and that, if they fared thus, much more will those whose act was not premeditated receive, not indeed such privileges as confer honour, but at least the lowest and last that they do not pay for the blood they have shed with their own. This shews that not every kind of homicide is culpable but only that which entails injustice, and that as for the other kinds if it is caused by an ardent yearning for virtue it is laudable and if unintentional it is free from blame.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="129"><p>  No 

more need be said about the first reason; we must proceed at once to explain the second.<ref target="7-557-a"/>  The law wishes to preserve the unintentional homicide, as it recognizes that in intention he was free from guilt, and that with his hands he had been the servant of justice, the overseer of human affairs. It knows that watching and waiting for him are blood-thirsty enemies, the kinsmen of the dead man, urged on to vengeance by overwhelming pity and inconsolable

<pb n="559"/>


grief, and so carried away by unreasoning passion that they do not inquire what is true or essentially just.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="130"><p> It therefore permitted such a one to fly for refuge, 

not to the holy temple, since he had not yet been purged, nor yet to some obscure and insignificant place where he might easily be surrendered as one of little account, but to a holy city which comes midway between holy and profane ground and is in a sense a secondary temple. For the cities of the consecrated order compared with the others receive a higher reverence, corresponding, I consider, to the honour paid to their respective occupants. The law wished in fact to use the superior rank of the city which gave them shelter to put the safety of the fugitive on the firmest possible footing.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="156"><p> Why,

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="158"><p> But the other

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="159"><p>  An 

example of this was given a little time ago in our own district by a person who was appointed to serve as a collector of taxes. When some of his debtors whose default was clearly due to poverty took flight in fear of the fatal consequences of his vengeance, he carried off by force their womenfolk and children and parents and their other relatives and beat and subjected them to every kind of outrage and contumely in order to make them either tell him the whereabouts of the fugitive or discharge his debt themselves. As they could do neither the first for want of knowledge, nor the second because they were as penniless as the fugitive, he continued this treatment until while

<pb n="577"/>


wringing their bodies with racks and instruments of torture he finally dispatched them by newly-invented methods of execution.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="160"><p> He filled a large 

basket with sand and having hung this enormous weight by ropes round their necks set them in the middle of the market-place in the open air, in order that while they themselves sank under the cruel stress of the accumulated punishments, the wind, the sun, the shame of being seen by the passers-by and the weights suspended on them, the spectators of their punishments might suffer by anticipation.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="161"><p> Some of 

these, whose souls saw facts more vividly than did their eyes, feeling themselves maltreated in the bodies of others, hastened to take leave of their lives with the aid of sword or poison or halter, thinking that in their evil plight it was a great piece of luck to die without suffering torture.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="162"><p> The others 

who had not seized the opportunity to dispatch themselves were brought out in a row, as is done in the awarding of inheritances, first those who stood in the first degrees of kinship, after them the second, then the third and so on till the last.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="163"><p> And when there were no kinsmen left, the maltreatment was passed on to their neighbours and sometimes even to villages and cities which quickly became desolate and stripped of their inhabitants who left their homes and dispersed to places where they expected to remain unobserved.Yet perhaps it is not to be wondered at

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="164"><p> Indeed in 


<pb n="579"/>


the past the legislators themselves, who are the landmarks and standards of justice, have not shrunk from acting as such<ref target="7-579-a"/>  to the greatest injustice.

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="165"><p> If they were companions in 

error let them also be companions in punishment, but if they had no association with the others, never followed the same objects, never let elation at the success of their kinsmen tempt them to a life of ease and pleasure, why should they be put to death? Is their relationship the one sole reason? Then is it birth or lawless actions which deserve punishment?</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="166"><p> Probably you, most reverend 

lawgivers, had worthy people for relations. If they had been bad, I do not think the idea of such enactments would have entered your minds.

and observing the errors current among other nations regarded them with aversion as ruinous to the ideal commonwealth; persons whose conduct shewed any kind of sloth or inhumanity or vice he detested and would not ever surrender anyone whose life had been passed in their company to be punished with them and thus made an appendix to the crimes of others.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="168"><p> He therefore expressly forbade that sons 

should be slain instead of fathers or fathers instead of sons. Thereby also he gave it as his judgement that persons who had sinned should be the persons who were punished, whether the punishment consisted of monetary fines or stripes and injurious treatment of a still more violent kind, or wounds and maiming and disfranchisement and exile or any other kind of sentence. For in the single statement that one man should not be killed instead of another he included also the cases which he left unmentioned.

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="171"><p> A woman,

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="172"><p> The audacity of women who when men are exchanging 

angry words or blows hasten to join in, under the pretext of assisting their husbands in the fray, is reprehensible and shameless in a high degree. And so in wars and campaigns and emergencies which threaten the whole country they are not allowed to take their place according to the judgement of the law, having in view the fitness of things, which it was resolved to keep unshaken always and everywhere and considered to be in itself more valuable than victory or liberty or success of any kind.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="173"><p> If indeed 

a woman learning that her husband is being outraged is overcome by the wifely feeling inspired by her love for him and forced by the stress of the emotion to hasten to his assistance, she must not unsex herself by a boldness beyond what nature

permits but limit herself to the ways in which a woman can help.

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="174"><p> What, is a

As it is, some of them go to such a length that, not only do we hear amid a crowd of men a woman’s bitter tongue venting abuse and contumelious words, but see her hands also used to assault—hands which were trained to weave and spin and not to inflict blows and injuries like pancratiasts and boxers.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="175"><p>  And while all else might be 

tolerable, it is a shocking thing, if a woman is so lost to a sense of modesty, as to catch hold of the genital parts of her opponent.<ref target="7-585-a"/>  The fact that she does so with the evident intention of helping her husband must not absolve her.<ref target="7-585-b"/>  To restrain her over-boldness she must pay a penalty which will incapacitate herself, if she wishes to repeat the offence, and frighten the more reckless members of her sex into proper behaviour.

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="176"><p> The managers of gymnastic 


<pb n="587"/>


competitions also deserve praise for debarring women from the spectacle,<ref target="7-587-a"/>  in order that they may not be present, when men are stripping themselves naked, nor debase the sterling coin of modesty, by disregarding the statutes of nature which she has laid down for each section of our race. For men too cannot with propriety be present when women are taking off their clothes. Each sex should turn away from seeing the nakedness of the other and so comply with what nature has willed.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="177"><p> Surely, then, if it is

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="178"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="32"/> This is the explanation commonly and 

widely stated, but I have heard another from highly gifted men who think that most of the contents of the law-book are outward symbols of hidden truths, expressing in words what has been left unsaid. This explanation was as follows.<ref target="7-587-b"/>  There is in the soul a male and female element just as there is in families, the male corresponding to the men, the female to the women. The male soul assigns itself to God alone as the Father and Maker of the Universe and the Cause of all things. The female clings to all that is born and perishes; it stretches out its faculties like a hand to catch blindly at what comes in its way, and gives the clasp of friendship to the world of created things with all its numberless changes and transmutations, instead of to the divine order, the immutable, the


<pb n="589"/>


blessed, the thrice happy.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="179"><p> Naturally therefore we 

are commanded in a symbol to cut off the hand which has taken hold of the “pair,”<ref target="7-589-a"/>  not meaning that the body should be mutilated by the loss of a most essential member, but to bid us exscind from the soul the godless thoughts which take for their basis all that comes into being through birth; for the “pair” are a symbol of seed-sowing and birth.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="180"><p> I will add 

another thought, following where the study of nature leads me.<ref target="7-589-b"/>  The monad is the image of the first cause, the dyad of matter passive and divisible. Therefore one who honours the dyad before the monad should not fail to know that he holds matter in higher esteem than God. It is for this reason that the law judged it right to cut off this tendency of the soul as if it were a hand, for there is no greater impiety than to ascribe to the passive element the power of the active principle.
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="181"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="33"/> The legislators deserve censure who 

prescribe for malefactors punishments which do not resemble the crime, such as monetary fines for assaults, disfranchisement for wounding or maiming another, expulsion from the country and perpetual banishment for wilful murder or imprisonment for theft.<ref target="7-589-c"/>  For inequality and unevenness is repugnant to the commonwealth which pursues truth.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="182"><p> Our

<pb n="591"/>


the penalty being determined according to the limb, part or sense affected, while if his malice extended to taking another’s life his own life should be the forfeit.

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="183"><p> In saying this I

for the services and benefits which the eyes render to the human race, it would take a long time to enumerate them, but one, the best, must be mentioned.

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="186"><p><ref target="7-593-b"/>  Now philosophy is the fountain 

of good things, all that are truly good, and he who draws from that spring deserves praise, if he does so for the acquisition and practice of virtue, but blame, if it is for knavish ends and to outwit another with sophistry.

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="187"><p> Now let us

the yearly seasons by which all things are brought to their consummation. Numberless other marvels did it behold, and after it had gazed around over earth and sea and the lower air, it made speed to shew all these things to the mind.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="189"><p> The mind, having 

discerned through the faculty of sight what of itself it was not able to apprehend, did not simply stop short at what it saw, but, drawn by its love of knowledge and beauty and charmed by the marvellous spectacle, came to the reasonable conclusion that all these were not brought together automatically by unreasoning forces, but by the mind of God Who is rightly called their Father and Maker; also that they are not unlimited but are bounded by the ambit of a single universe, walled in like a city by the outermost sphere of the fixed stars; also that the Father Who begat them according to the law of nature takes thought for His offspring, His providence watching over both the whole and the parts.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="190"><p> Then it went on to inquire 

what is the substance of the world which we see and whether its constituents are all the same in substance or do some differ from others; what are the elements of which each particular part is composed, what are the causes which brought them into being, and what are the forces or properties which hold them together and are these forces corporeal or incorporeal.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="191"><p> We 

may well ask what title we can give to research into these matters but philosophy and what more fitting name than philosopher to their investigator.

which loves to learn, loves to contemplate and is truly wisdom-loving or philosophical.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="192"><p> This is the greatest boon which sight bestowed on 

human life, and I think that this pre-eminence has been awarded to it because it is more closely akin to the soul than the other senses. They are all of the same family as the mind, but, just as it is with families, the place which is closest in birth<ref target="7-597-a"/>  and first and highest, is held by sight.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="193"><p> We may find many 

proofs of this, for who does not know that when we rejoice the eyes are bright and smiling, when we are sad they are full of anxiety and dejection, and, if the burden is magnified and presses and crushes, they break out into tears; when anger prevails they swell and their look is bloodshot and fiery; when the temper dies down it is gentle and kindly; </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="194"><p>when we 

are reflecting or inquiring the pupils are set and seem to share our thoughts, while in persons of little sense their silliness makes their vision roaming and restless. In general the emotions of the soul are shared by the eyes, and as it passes through its numberless phases they change with it, a natural consequence of their affinity.<ref target="7-597-b"/>  Indeed it seems to me that nowhere else in God’s creations is the inward and invisible so well represented by the outward and visible as reason is by sight.
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="195"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="35"/> If, then, anyone has maliciously injured 

another in the best and lordliest of his senses, sight, and is proved to have struck out his eye, he must in his turn suffer the same, if the other is a free man,<ref target="7-597-c"/>  but not if he is a slave. Not that the offender deserves pardon or is less in the wrong, but because


<pb n="599"/>


if the master is mutilated as a punishment the injured slave will find him worse than before. He will harbour a perpetual grudge for his misfortune and avenge himself on one whom he regards as a mortal enemy by setting him every day to tasks of an intolerable kind and beyond his powers to cope with, the oppressive weight of which will break his spirit also.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="196"><p> The law, therefore, provided 

on the one hand that a master should not go unpunished for his malicious assault and on the other that the servant should not suffer further wrong in addition to the loss of his eye.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="197"><p> It effected this by enacting that if anyone struck out his servant’s eye he should without hesitation grant him his liberty, for 

in this way the master will incur a double penalty; he will lose the value of the slave as well as his services, and a third affliction more severe than either of these two is that he will be forced to confer a benefit that touches his highest interest on an enemy whom he probably hoped to be able to maltreat indefinitely. The servant will receive a double solatium for his suffering; he is not only set at liberty but has escaped from a harsh and cruel master.
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="198"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="36"/> A further command is that if anyone 

strikes out a servant’s tooth he must grant him his liberty.<ref target="7-599-a"/>  Why is this? Because life is precious and the means contrived by nature for the preservation of life are teeth by which the food is subjected to the processes necessary for dealing with it. Now the teeth are divided into the cutters and the grinders; the former do their part by cutting or biting the bread-stuffs and all other comestibles, whence their appropriate name of cutters, the latter by their


<pb n="601"/>


capacity for reducing the bitten pieces into smaller particles.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="199"><p>  This is the reason why the 

Maker and Father, Whose way is to frame nothing that does not serve some purpose, did not make the teeth straight away at birth like each of the other parts. He bore in mind that they would be a superfluous burden to the infant who would be fed on milk, and would also bring serious trouble to the breasts, the fountain through which the liquid sustenance flows, as they would be galled during the suction of the milk.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="200"><p> He 

looked forward, therefore, to the proper time, that is, to when the infant is weaned from the breast, and brought out that supplementary growth of teeth, which He hitherto kept in storage, only when the infant would refuse to take food in the form of milk and could bear the more mature kind which requires the instruments which I have mentioned.
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="201"><p><milestone unit="para"/>If, then, anyone gives way to insolent presumption 

and strikes out his servant’s tooth which ministers obediently to his most essential needs, sustenance and survival, he must set at liberty the victim of his injustice and suffer himself the loss of the services and ministries of the injured party.<ref target="7-601-a"/>  Is a tooth then, I shall be asked, of the same value as an eye?</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="202"><p> They 

are both, I should reply, of the same value for the purposes for which they were made, the eye being made for what is visible, the tooth for what is edible. And if anyone cares to compare these, he will find that the eye is the noblest of the body’s members because it contemplates the heaven which is the noblest part of the universe, while the tooth is useful as the operator


<pb n="603"/>


of what is most useful for maintaining life, namely food. Also anyone who has lost his sight is not thereby prevented from living, but one who has had his teeth struck out has only a most miserable death awaiting him.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="203"><p> So if anyone takes steps to injure his 

servants in this part of their bodies he must recognize that the effect of his act upon them is a famine artificially created in the midst of abundance and plenty.

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="204"><p> And therefore elsewhere 

the lawgiver forbids creditors to demand that their debtors should give their mill or upper millstone as a surety, and he adds that anyone who does so takes the life to pledge.<ref target="7-603-a"/>  For one who deprives another of the instruments needed to preserve existence is well on the way to murder, since his hostile intentions extend to attacking life itself.

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="205"><p><milestone unit="para"/><ref target="7-603-b"/> So careful was the lawgiver to guard against any-one 

helping to bring about the death of another that he considers that even those who have touched the corpse of one who has met a natural death must remain unclean<ref target="7-603-c"/>  until they have been purified by aspersions and ablutions. Indeed he did not permit even the fully cleansed to enter the temple within

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="206"><p><ref target="7-605-a"/>  Further too, those who

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="207"><p><ref target="7-605-c"/>  For a man’s soul is a precious thing, and when it 

departs to seek another home, all that will be left behind is defied, deprived as it is of the divine image.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="209"><p> For the unjust and impious 

man is in the truest sense unclean. No thought of respect for things human or divine ever enters his mind.

The laws directed against adultery and murder and the offences which fall under either head have been already discussed with all possible fullness as I venture to think.

 </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="2"><p>
Anyone who carries off
any kind of property<ref target="8-7-b"/> belonging to another and to which he has no right must be written down as a public enemy,<ref target="8-7-c"/> if he does so openly and with violence, because he combines shameless effrontery with

defiance of the law.<ref target="8-9-a"/>  But if he does it secretly and tries to avoid observation like a thief, since his ashamedness serves to palliate his misdeeds,<ref target="8-9-b"/>  he must be punished in his private capacity, and, as he is liable only for the damage which he has attempted to work, he must repay the stolen goods twofold<ref target="8-9-c"/>  and thus by the damage which he most justly suffers make full amends for the injustice of his gains.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="3"><p> If his lack of means makes

the payment of this penalty impossible he must be sold,<ref target="8-9-d"/>  since it is only right that one who has allowed himself to become a slave to profit-making of an utterly lawless kind should be deprived of his liberty. And in this way the injured party also will not be turned away without a solatium or seem to have his interest neglected through the impecuniosity of the thief.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="4"><p> No one should denounce this sentence as

inhuman, for the person sold is not left a slave for all time but he is released at or before the seventh year<ref target="8-9-e"/>  under the general proclamation as I have shown

in the treatise on the seventh day.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="5"><p><ref target="8-11-a"/>   Nor

need he complain because he has to repay twice the value of the stolen goods, or even if he is sold. For he is guilty in several ways. First because dissatisfied with what he has he desires a greater abundance and thus fortifies the malignant and well-nigh deadly passion of coveteousness. Secondly because it is the property of others which he eyes so avidly and sets his snares to secure for himself and deprive the owners of their possession. Thirdly because the concealment which he also practises, while it secures him the profits of the business often for his sole enjoyment, leads him to divert the charge in each case to innocent persons and so blindfold the quest for the truth.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="6"><p> It would

seem too that he is his own accuser, since his conscience convicts him when he filches in this stealthy way, for he must be actuated by shame or fear.

<pb n="13"/>


in.<ref target="8-13-a"/>  Though actually engaged on the primary but minor crime of theft he is intending the major though secondary crime of murder, since he is prepared if prevented by anyone to defend himself with the iron burglar’s tools which he carries and other weapons. But if the sun has risen the case is different; he must not be killed off hand<ref target="8-13-b"/>  but taken before magistrates and judges to pay such penalties as they prescribe.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="8"><p> For in the night time when

rulers and ordinary citizens alike are settled down at home and retiring to rest, the aggrieved person cannot seek out any one to succour him, and therefore he must take the punishment into his own hands, as the occasion appoints him to be magistrate and judge.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="9"><p> In the day time however law courts

and council chambers stand wide open and there are plenty of people to help him in the city, some of them elected to maintain the laws, others who without such election are so moved by their hatred of evil that they need none to bid them to take the role of championing the injured. Before these must the thief be brought, for in this way the owner will escape the charges of wilfulness and recklessness and show that he protects himself in the spirit of true democracy.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="10"><p> And if the sun is above the

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="11"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="3"/> Other stolen goods then are to be paid for

at twice their value, but if the thief has taken a sheep or an ox the law estimates them worthy of a larger penalty, thus giving precedence to the animals which excel all the other domesticated kinds not only in comeliness of body but in the benefits they bring to human life.<ref target="8-15-a"/>  This was the reason why he made a difference even between the two just named in the amount of the penalty to be paid. He reckoned up the services which each of them renders and ordained that the compensation should correspond thereto.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="12"><p> The thief has

to pay four sheep but five oxen for the one that he has stolen because the sheep renders four contributions, milk, cheese, wool and the lambs which are born every year, while the ox makes five, three the same as the sheep, of milk, cheese and offspring, and two peculiar to itself, ploughing and threshing, the first of them being the beginning of the sowing of the crops, the second their end, serving to purge them when harvested and make them more ready to be used as food.<ref target="8-15-b"/>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="14"><p> But it is the lot of man, as we see, to occupy

the place of highest excellence among living creatures because his stock is near akin to God,<ref target="8-17-a"/>  sprung from the same source in virtue of his participation in reason which gives him immortality, mortal though he seems to be. And therefore everyone who is inspired with a zeal for virtue is severe of temper and absolutely implacable against menstealers,
who for the sake of a most unrighteous profit do not shrink from reducing to slavery those who not only are freemen by birth but are of the same nature as themselves.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="15"><p> If it is a praiseworthy

action when masters in the humaneness of their hearts release from the yoke of servitude their home-bred or purchased slaves, though often they have brought them no great profit, how great a condemnation do they deserve who rob those who enjoy liberty of that most precious of all possessions for which men of noble birth and breeding feel that it is an honour to die.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="16"><p>  Indeed we

have known of some who improve on their inborn depravity and developing the malice of their disposition to complete heartlessness have directed their man-stealing operations, not only against men of other countries and other races but also against those of their own nation, sometimes their fellow wardsmen or tribesmen. They disregard their partnership in the laws and customs in which they have been bred from their earliest years, customs which stamp the sense of benevolence so firmly on

<pb n="19"/>


the souls of all who are not exceedingly barbarous nor make a practice of cruelty.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="17"><p> For the sake of an

utterly unlawful profit they sell their captives to slave dealers or any chance comers to live in slavery in a foreign land never to return, never even to dream of again saluting the soil of their native country or to know the taste of comforting hope. Their iniquity would be less if they themselves retained the services of their captives. As it is, their guilt is doubled when they barter them away and raise up to menace them two masters instead of one and two successive servitudes.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="18"><p> For they

themselves, as they know the former prosperity of those who are now in their power, might perhaps come to a better mind and feel a belated pity for their fallen state, remembering with awe how uncertain and incalculable fortune is, while the purchasers knowing nothing of their origin and supposing them to have generations of servitude behind them will despise them, and have nothing in their souls to incline them to that natural gentleness and humanity which they may be expected to maintain in dealing with the free born.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="19"><p>  The

punishment for kidnapping, if the captives belong to foreign nations, should be such as is adjudged by the court; if they are fellow nationals whom they have not only kidnapped but sold, it is death without hope of reprieve.

that desire is based not on differences of situation but on the thoughts of insatiable and quarrelsome men.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="21"><p> And therefore the most law-abiding states

elect two kinds of superintendents and magistrates to maintain the general safety and good order, one kind to act within the walls called “town warden,” the other outside them bearing the appropriate name of “country warden,”<ref target="8-21-a"/>  and what need could there be of the last if there were not people in the landed estates also who lived to do harm to their neighbours?</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="23"><p><ref target="8-21-b"/>  And he must suffer this without

complaining. The law has shown itself reasonable and exceedingly forgiving in its treatment of him. Though his actions are such as are committed in internecine war, where it is customary to lay waste arable fields and destroy the cultivated plants, it has not punished him as a public enemy by sentencing him to death or banishment, or at the very least<ref target="8-21-c"/>  to forfeiture of his whole property, but merely called upon him to make good the damage to the owner.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="24"><p> For since it always seeks pretexts for

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="25"><p> The trespasser must therefore be held responsible

to justice for originally driving the herd into a field where they ought not to be, but should not bear the guilt of all its results, for it may well be that when he perceived the harm they were doing he tried to drive them out as fast as he could, but they as they were browsing on the herbage and taking their fill of tender fruits and plants resisted his efforts.

But that is not the method of deposits.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="31"><p>

There a man gives something with his own hands secretly to another when both are alone. He looks carefully all round him and does not even bring a slave, however loyal, with him to act as carrier, for the object which both of them evidently pursue is that it should be impossible to show what has happened. The one wishes that nobody should observe his gift, the other that no one should know of his acceptance. And this unseen transaction has assuredly the unseen God as its intermediary,

<pb n="27"/>


to whom both naturally appeal as their witness, one that he will restore the property when demanded, the other that he will recover it at the proper time.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="32"><p> So then he who repudiates a deposit

must be assured that he acts most wrongfully. He deceives the hopes of the friend who confided his goods to him. He has disguised under fair words the vileness of his character. In the faithlessness of his heart he has assumed the mask of a bastard faithfulness. The assurance of the hands given and taken is rendered null and void, the oaths are unfulfilled. Thus he has set at nought both the human and the divine and repudiated two trusts, one that of him who consigned his property, the other that of the most veracious of witnesses who sees and hears all whether they intend or do not wish to do what they say.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="33"><p><ref target="8-27-a"/>  But if the deposit, which

the receiver accepts as something sacred and feels bound to keep unharmed because of his reverence for truth and good faith, is purloined by stealthy mischievous intruders, cutpurses and burglars on the watch to take what does not belong to them, the offenders if caught must pay a fine of double the value.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="34"><p><ref target="8-27-b"/>  If they are not caught the receiver of

<pb n="29"/>


swear under pain of his own perdition<ref target="8-29-a"/>  that he has not embezzled any part of the deposit nor abetted another in so doing nor joined at all in inventing a theft which never took place.<ref target="8-29-b"/>  Otherwise<ref target="8-29-c"/>  an innocent party would be mulcted and the person who ran to avail himself of the good faith of a friend would on account of the wrong he has suffered from others cause injury to that friend, and either of these is preposterous.<ref target="8-29-d"/>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="35"><p><milestone unit="para"/>But deposits include not only inanimate things

but living animals who are liable to be endangered in two ways: one by theft which they share with the inanimate, the other by death which is peculiar to themselves. The first of these has been dealt with above and we must proceed to lay down laws for the second.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="36"><p><ref target="8-29-e"/>  So if any animal left in trust dies

the person who has accepted the trust must send for the consigner and show him the dead body, thus shielding himself against any suspicion of dishonesty. If the consigner is absent from home, it would not be right for the caretaker to summon

other people from whom the depositor may have wished to keep the matter secret, but when he has come home he must swear to him to show that he is not using a fictitious death to cloak an embezzlement.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="37"><p><ref target="8-31-a"/>  But if any utensil or any animal has

been received not as a trust but for his use in response to a request and then either<ref target="8-31-b"/>  of these is stolen, or the animal dies, the borrower will not be responsible if the lender is living on the spot, since he can call him to witness that there is no pretence. If he is not living on the spot the borrower must make good the loss. Why is this?</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="38"><p>

Because in the absence of the owner the borrower may either have worn out the animal by constantly overworking it and so have caused its death, or may have risked<ref target="8-31-c"/>  the loss of the utensil out of carelessness for what is another man’s property, whereas he is bound to keep it carefully and not provide thieves with facilities for carrying it off.

sacred constitution laid down by Moses must be exempt from every unreasoning passion and every vice in a higher degree than those who are governed by other laws, and that this particularly applies to those who are appointed to act as judges by lot<ref target="8-43-a"/>  or election. For it is against all reason that those who claim to dispense justice to others should themselves have offences to answer for.

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="57"><p> And this will come to pass if

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="59"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="10"/> The first instruction that the law gives to the

judge is that he should not accept idle hearing.<ref target="8-45-b"/>  What is this? “Let your ears, my friend,” he says, “be purged” and purged they will be if streams of worthy thoughts and words are constantly poured into them and if they refuse to admit the long-winded expositions,<ref target="8-45-c"/>  the idle hackneyed<ref target="8-45-d"/>  absurdities of the makers of myths and farces and of vain inventions with their glorification of the worthless.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="60"><p> And the phrase “not accept idle hearing”

has another signification consistent with that just mentioned. If men listen to hearsay given as evidence their listening will be idle and unsound. Why so? Because the eyes are conversant with the actual events; they are in a sense in contact with the facts and grasp them in their completeness through the co-operation of the light which reveals and tests everything. But ears, as one of the ancients has aptly said, are less trustworthy than eyes<ref target="8-45-e"/> ; they are not conversant with facts, but are distracted by words which interpret the facts but are not necessarily always veracious.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="61"><p> And therefore it

seems that some Grecian legislators did well when they copied from the most sacred tables of Moses





<pb n="47"/>


the enactment that hearing is not accepted as evidence,<ref target="8-47-a"/>  meaning that what a man has seen is to be judged trustworthy, but what he has heard is not entirely reliable.
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="62"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="11"/> The second instruction to the judge is not to

take gifts, for gifts, says the law, blind the eyes<ref target="8-47-b"/> 
which see and corrupt the things that are just, while they prevent the mind from pursuing its course straight along the high road.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="63"><p> And while receiving

bribes to do injustice is the act of the utterly depraved, to receive them to do justice shows a half depravity. For there are some magistrates half way in wickedness,<ref target="8-47-c"/>  mixtures of justice and injustice, who having been appointed to the duty of supporting the wronged against the wrongdoers think themselves justified in refusing without a consideration to record a victory to the necessarily victorious party and so make their verdict a thing purchased and paid for.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="64"><p><ref target="8-47-d"/>  Then when they are attacked they

plead that they did not pervert justice, since those who ought to lose did lose and those who deserved to win were successful. This is a bad defence, for two things are demanded from the good judge, a verdict absolutely according to law and a refusal to be bribed. But the awarder<ref target="8-47-e"/>  of justice who has taken gifts for it has unconsciously disfigured what nature has made beautiful.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="65"><p> Apart from this

he offends in two other ways; he is habituating himself to be covetous of money, and that vice is the source from which the greatest iniquities spring,




<pb n="49"/>


and he is injuring one who deserves to be benefited when that person has to pay a price for justice.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="66"><p> And therefore Moses gives us a very instructive

command, when he bids us pursue justice justly,<ref target="8-49-a"/>  implying that it is possible to do so unjustly. He refers to those who give a just award for lucre, not only in law courts but everywhere on land and sea and one may almost say in all the affairs of life.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="67"><p> Thus we have heard of a person

accepting a deposit of little value and repaying it with a view to ensnare rather than to benefit the person to whom he gives it.<ref target="8-49-b"/>  His object was by baiting his hook with trustworthiness in small matters to secure trustfulness in greater things, and this is nothing else than executing justice unjustly, for while repayment of what is due to others is a just deed, it was not done justly being done in pursuit of further gains.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="68"><p>  Now the principal cause

of such misdeeds is familiarity with falsehood which grows up with the children right from their birth and from the cradle, the work of nurses and mothers and the rest of the company, slaves and free, who belong to the household.

And beside truth he set a kindred quality which he called “clear showing,” the two representing both aspects of the reason we possess, the inward and the outward. For the outward requires clear showing by which the invisible thoughts in each of us<ref target="8-51-a"/>  are made known to our neighbours. The inward requires truth to bring to perfection the conduct of life and the actions by which the way to happiness is discovered.
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="70"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="12"/> A third instruction to the judge is that he

should scrutinize the facts rather than the litigants and should try in every way to withdraw himself from the contemplation of those whom he is trying.<ref target="8-51-b"/>  He must force himself to ignore and forget those whom he has known and remembered, relations, friends and fellow citizens and on the other hand strangers, enemies, foreigners so that neither kind feeling nor hatred may becloud his decision of what is just.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="71"><p> Otherwise he must stumble like a blind man proceeding without a staff or others to guide his feet on whom he can lean with security; and

therefore the good judge must draw a veil over the disputants, whoever they are, and keep in view the nature of the facts in their naked simplicity. He must come with the intention of judging according to truth and not according to the opinions of




<pb n="53"/>


men, and with the thought before him that “judgement is God’s”<ref target="8-53-a"/>  and the judge is the steward of judgement. As a steward he is not permitted to give away his master’s goods, for the best of all things in human life is the trust he has received from the hands of One who is Himself the best of all.
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="72"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="13"/> He adds to those already mentioned another

wise precept, not to show pity to the poor man in giving judgement<ref target="8-53-b"/>  And this comes from one who has filled practically his whole legislation with injunctions to show pity and kindness, who issues severe threats against the haughty and arrogant and offers great rewards to those who feel it a duty to redress the misfortunes of their neighbours and to look upon abundant wealth not as their personal possession but as something to be shared by those who are in need.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="73"><p> For what one of the men of old<ref target="8-53-c"/>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="74"><p> So then let not the rich man collect great

store of gold and silver and hoard it at his house, but bring it out for general use that he may soften the hard lot of the needy with the unction of his cheerfully given liberality.

If he possesses bodily vigour, let him be the support of the weaker and not as men do in athletic contest take every means of battering down the less powerful,

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="75"><p> All who have drawn water

And when they see young people gifted by nature like fine thriving plants, they rejoice to think that they have found some to inherit the spiritual wealth which is the only true wealth.

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="76"><p>Such gems<ref target="8-55-a"/>  of varied beauty are interwoven

in the laws, bidding us give wealth to the poor, and it is only on the judgement seat that we are forbidden to show them compassion. Compassion is for misfortunes, and he who acts wickedly of his own free will is not unfortunate but unjust.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="77"><p> Let punishment be meted to the unjust as surely as

honours to the just. And therefore let no cowering, cringing rogue of a poor man evade his punishment by exciting pity for his penniless condition.

And therefore one who undertakes to act as judge must be a good money changer, sifting with discrimination the nature of each of the facts before him, so that genuine and spurious may not be jumbled together in confusion.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="78"><p> There is much

else which might be said about false witnesses and judges, but to avoid prolixity we must proceed to

<milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="14"/> Every passion is blameworthy.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="79"><p> This follows

from the censure due to every “inordinate and excessive impulse” and to “irrational and unnatural movements” of the soul,<ref target="8-57-b"/>  for both these are nothing else than the opening out of a long-standing passion. So if a man does not set bounds to his impulses and bridle them like horses which defy the reins he is the victim of a wellnigh fatal passion, and that defiance will cause him to be carried away before he knows it like a driver borne by his team into ravines or impassable abysses whence it is hardly possible to escape.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="80"><p> But none of the passions is so

troublesome as covetousness or desire of what we have not, things which seem good, though they are not truly good. Such desire breeds fierce and endless yearnings; it urges and drives the soul ever so far into the boundless distance while the object of the chase often flies insolently before it, with its face not its back turned to the pursuer.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="81"><p><ref target="8-57-c"/>  For when it

perceives the desire eagerly racing after it it stands still for a while to entice it and provide a hope of its capture, then it is off and away, mocking and railing as the interval between them grows longer and longer.

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="82"><p> For just as those unmerciful and

relentless mistresses of the body, hunger and thirst, rack it with pains as great as, or greater than, those of the sufferers on the tormentor’s wheel, and often bring it to the point of death unless their savagery is assuaged by food and drink, so it is with the soul. Desire makes it empty through oblivion of what is present, and then through memory of what is far away it produces fierce and uncontrollable madness, and thus creates mistresses harsher than those just mentioned though bearing the same name, hunger and thirst, in this case, not for what gives gratification to the belly, but for money, reputation, government, beautiful women<ref target="8-59-a"/>  and all the innumerable objects which are held in human life to be enviable and worthy of a struggle.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="83"><p> And

just as the creeping sickness, as physicians call it, does not stand still in one place but moves about and courses round and round and justifies its name by creeping about, spreading in all directions, and gripping and seizing all parts of the body’s system from the crown of the head to the sole of the feet, so does desire dart through the whole soul and leave not the smallest bit of it uninjured.<ref target="8-59-b"/>  In this it imitates the force of fire working on an abundance of fuel which it kindles into a blaze and devours until it has utterly consumed it.

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="85"><p> For the

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="89"><p>  If the desire is directed

to office, they are factious, inequitable, tyrannical in nature, cruel-hearted, foes of their country, merciless masters to those who are weaker, irreconcilable enemies of their equals in strength and flatterers of their superiors in power as a preparation for their treacherous attack.  If the object is bodily beauty they are seducers, adulterers, pederasts, cultivators of incontinence and lewdness, as though these worst of evils were the best of blessings.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="90"><p>  We have known desire to

make its way to the tongue and cause an infinity of troubles, for some desire to keep unspoken what should be told or to tell what should be left unsaid, and avenging justice attends on utterance in the one case and silence in the opposite.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="91"><p>  And when it takes hold of the region of the belly, it

him who introduced the Ionians and Sybarites to luxurious and voluptuous practices. Instead he opened up a path midway between the two. He relaxed the overstrained and tightened the lax, and as on an instrument of music blended the very high and the very low at each end of the scale with the middle chord, thus producing a life of harmony and concord which none can blame. Consequently he neglected nothing, but drew up very careful rules as to what they should or should not take as food.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="103"><p>  Possibly it might be thought just 

that all wild beasts that feed on human flesh should suffer from men what men have suffered from them. But Moses would have us abstain from the enjoyment of such, even though they provide a very appetizing and delectable repast. He was considering what is suitable to a gentle-mannered soul, for though it is fitting enough that one should suffer for what one has done, it is not fitting conduct for the sufferers to retaliate it on the wrongdoers, lest the savage passion of anger should turn them unawares into beasts. So careful is he against this 104 danger that wishing to restrain by implication the appetite for the food just mentioned,<ref target="8-71-a"/>  he also strictly forbade them to eat the other carnivorous animals. He distinguished between them and the graminivorous which he grouped with the gentle kind since indeed they are naturally tame and live on the gentle fruits which the earth produces and do nothing by way of attempting the life of others.
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="105"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="18"/> They are the calf, the lamb, the kid, the 

hart, the gazelle, the buffalo, the wild goat, the pygarg, the antelope, and the giraffe, ten in all.<ref target="8-71-b"/>  For as he always adhered to the principles of

<pb n="73"/>


numerical science, which he knew by close observance to be a paramount factor in all that exists, he never enacted any law great or small without calling to his aid and as it were accommodating to his enactment its appropriate number. But of all the numbers from the unit upwards ten is the most perfect, and, as Moses says, most holy and sacred, and with this he seals his list of the clean kinds of animals when he wishes to appoint them for the use of the members of his commonwealth.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="106"><p>  He adds a general method for proving 

and testing the ten kinds, based on two signs, the parted hoof and the chewing of the cud.<ref target="8-73-a"/>  Any kind which lacks both or one of these is unclean. Now both these two are symbols to teacher and learner of the method best suited for acquiring knowledge, the method by which the better is distinguished from the worse, and thus confusion is avoided.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="107"><p> For just as a cud-chewing animal after 

biting through the food keeps it at rest in the gullet, again after a bit draws it up and masticates it and then passes it on to the belly, so the pupil after receiving from the teacher through his ears the principles and lore of wisdom prolongs the process of learning, as he cannot at once apprehend and grasp them securely, till by using memory to call up each thing that he has heard by constant exercises which act as the cement of conceptions, he stamps a firm impression of them on his soul.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="108"><p> But the firm 

apprehension of conceptions is clearly useless unless we discriminate and distinguish them so that we can choose what we should choose and avoid the



<pb n="75"/>


contrary, and this distinguishing is symbolized by the parted hoof. For the way of life is twofold, one branch leading to vice, the other to virtue and we must turn away from the one and never forsake the other.
<milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="19"/> Therefore all creatures whose 109 hooves are uniform or multiform<ref target="8-75-a"/>  are unclean, the one because they signify the idea that good and bad have one and the same nature, which is like confusing concave and convex or uphill and downhill in a road; the multiform because they set before our life many roads, which are rather no roads, to cheat us, for where there is a multitude to choose from it is not easy to find the best and most serviceable path.
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="110"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="20"/> After laying down these limitations for the 

land animals he proceeds to describe such creatures of the water as are clean for eating. These too he indicates by two distinguishing marks, fins and scales; all that lack either or both he dismisses and repudiates.<ref target="8-75-b"/>  I must state the reason for this which is appropriate enough.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="111"><p> Any that fail to 

possess both or one of these marks are swept away by the current unable to resist the force of the stream; those who possess both throw it aside, front and stem it and pertinaciously exercise themselves against the antagonist with an invincible ardour and audacity. When they are pushed they push back, when pursued they hasten to assail, where their passage is hampered they open up broad roads and obtain easy thoroughfares.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="112"><p> These 

two kinds of fish are symbolical, the first of a pleasure-loving



<pb n="77"/>


soul, the latter of one to which endurance and self-control are dear. For the road that leads to pleasure is downhill and very easy, with the result that one does not walk but is dragged along; the other which leads to self-control is uphill, toilsome no doubt but profitable exceedingly. The one carries us away, forced lower and lower as it drives us down its steep incline, till it flings us off on to the level ground at its foot; the other leads heavenwards the immortal who have not fainted on the way and have had the strength to endure the roughness of the hard ascent.
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="113"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="21"/> Holding to the same method he declares 

that all reptiles which have not feet but wriggle along by trailing their belly, or are four-legged and many footed are unclean for eating.<ref target="8-77-a"/>  Here again he has a further meaning: by the reptiles he signifies persons who devote themselves to their bellies<ref target="8-77-b"/>  and fill themselves like a cormorant,<ref target="8-77-c"/>  paying to the miserable stomach constant tributes of strong drink, bake-meats, fishes and in general all the delicacies produced with every kind of viand by the elaborate skill of cooks and confectioners, thereby fanning and fostering the flame of the insatiable ever-greedy desires. By the four-legged and many footed he means the base slaves not of one passion only, desire,





<pb n="79"/>


but of all. For the passions fall under four main heads but have a multitude of species, and while the tyranny of one is cruel the tyranny of many cannot but be most harsh and intolerable.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="114"><p> Creeping 

things which have legs above their feet, so that they can leap from the ground, he classes among the clean<ref target="8-79-a"/>  as for instance the different kinds of grasshoppers and the snake-fighter as it is called; and here again by symbols he searches into the temperaments and ways of a reasonable soul. For the natural gravitation of the body pulls down with it those of little mind, strangling and overwhelming them with the multitude of the fleshly elements.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="115"><p> Blessed are they 

to whom it is given to resist with superior strength the weight that would pull them down, taught by the guiding lines of right<ref target="8-79-b"/>  instruction to leap upward from earth and earth-bound things into the ether and the revolving heavens, that sight so much desired, so worthy a prize in the eyes of those who come to it with a will and not half-heartedly.

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="116"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="22"/> Having discoursed on the subject of the 

different kinds of animals on land and in the water and laid down the best possible laws for distinguishing between them, he proceeds to examine also the remaining parts of the animal creation, the inhabitants of the air. Of these he disqualified a vast number of kinds, in fact all that prey on other fowls or on men, creatures which are carnivorous and venomous and in general use their strength to attack others.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="117"><p><ref target="8-79-c"/>  But doves, pigeons, turtledoves, and 


<pb n="81"/>


the tribes of cranes, geese and the like he reckons as belonging to the tame and gentle class and gives to any who wish full liberty to make use of them as food.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="118"><p> Thus in each element of the universe, 

earth, water, air he withdrew from our use various kinds of each sort, land creatures, water creatures, flying fowls, and by this as by the withdrawal of fuel from a fire he creates an extinguisher to desire.
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="119"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="23"/> Further he forbade them to have anything 

to do with<ref target="8-81-a"/>  bodies of animals that have died of themselves or have been torn by wild beasts, the latter because a man ought not to be table mate with savage brutes and one might almost say share with them the enjoyment of their feasts of flesh; the former perhaps because it is a noxious and insanitary practice since the body contains dead serum as well as blood; also it may be because the fitness of things bids us keep untouched what we find deceased, and respect the fate which the compulsion of nature has already imposed.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="120"><p> Skilful 

hunters who know how to hit their quarry with an aim that rarely misses the mark and preen themselves on their success in this sport, particularly when they share<ref target="8-81-b"/>  the pieces of their prey with the other huntsmen as well as with the hounds, are extolled by most legislators among Greeks and



<pb n="83"/>


Barbarians, not only for their courage, but also for their liberality. But the author of the holy commonwealth might rightly blame them<ref target="8-83-a"/>  since for the reasons stated he definitely forbade the enjoyment of bodies which died a natural death or were torn by wild beasts.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="121"><p> If anyone of the devotees 

of hard training who is a lover of gymnastic exercises becomes a lover of the chase also,<ref target="8-83-b"/>  because he considers that it gives a preliminary practice for war and for the dangers incurred in facing the enemy, he should when he meets with success in the chase throw the fallen beasts to feast the hounds as a wage or prize for their courage and faithful assistance. He himself should not touch these carcases, thus learning from his dealing with irrational animals what he should feel with regard to human enemies, who should be combated not for wrongful gain as foot-pads do, but in self-defence, either to avenge the injuries which he has suffered already or to guard against those which he expects to suffer in the future.

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="122"><p><milestone unit="para"/>But some of the type of Sardanapalus greedily 

extend their unrestrained and excessive luxury beyond all bounds and limits.

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="123"><p> For they should be fully contented with enjoying the flesh only and not lay hold on what is akin to the soul; and therefore elsewhere<ref target="8-85-c"/>  he 

legislates on the subject of blood that no one should put either it or the fat to his mouth. Blood is prohibited for the reason which I have mentioned that it is the essence of the soul, not of the intelligent and reasonable soul, but of that which operates through the senses, the soul that gives the life which we and the irrational animals possess in common.
<milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="24"/> For the essence or substance of that other soul is divine spirit, a truth vouched for by Moses especially, who in his story of the creation says that God breathed a breath of life upon the first man, the founder of our race, into the lordliest part of his body, the face,<ref target="8-85-d"/>  where the senses are stationed like bodyguards to the great king, the mind. And clearly what was then thus breathed was ethereal spirit, or something if such there be better than ethereal spirit, even an effulgence of the blessed, thrice blessed nature of the Godhead.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="124"><p> The fat is prohibited because it is the richest part

and here again he teaches us to practise self-restraint and foster the aspiration for the life of austerity which relinquishes what is easiest and lies ready to hand, but willingly endures anxiety and toils in order to acquire virtue.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="125"><p> It is for this reason 

that with every victim these two, the blood and the fat, are set apart as a sort of first fruits and consumed in their entirety.

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="127"><p> Then, 

when there was a scarcity, they joined together to accuse and reproach and brow-beat their ruler with shameless effrontery and did not cease from giving trouble until their desire was granted though it was to their undoing.

With both hands they pulled in the creatures and filled their laps with them, then put them away in their tents, and, since excessive avidity knows no bounds, went out to catch others, and after dressing them in any way<ref target="8-89-c"/>  they could devoured them greedily, doomed in their senselessness to be destroyed by the surfeit. Indeed they shortly perished through discharges 130 of bile,<ref target="8-89-d"/>  so that the place also received its name from the disaster which befell them, for it was called “Monuments of Lust”<ref target="8-89-e"/> —lust than which no greater evil can exist in the soul as the story shows.





<pb n="91"/>


And therefore most excellent are these words of 131 Moses in his Exhortations, “Each man shall not do what is pleasing in his own sight,”<ref target="8-91-a"/>  which is as much as to say “let no one indulge his own lust. Let a man be well pleasing to God, to the universe, to nature, to laws, to wise men and discard self love. So only will he attain true excellence.”
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="132"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="25"/> In these remarks we have discussed the 

matters relating to desire or lust as adequately as our abilities allow, and thus completed our survey of the ten oracles, and the laws which are dependent on them. For if we are right in describing the main heads delivered by the voice of God as generic laws, and all particular laws of which Moses was the spokesman as dependent species, for accurate apprehension free from confusion scientific study was needed, with the aid of which I have assigned and attached to each of the heads what was appropriate to them throughout the whole legislation.
<milestone unit="para"/>Enough then of this.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="133"><p> But we must not fail to 

know that, just as each of the ten separately has some particular laws akin to it having nothing in common with any other, there are some things<ref target="8-91-b"/>  common to all which fit in not with some particular number<ref target="8-91-c"/>  such as one or two but with all the ten Great Words.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="134"><p> These are the virtues of universal 

value. For each of the ten pronouncements separ



<pb n="93"/>


ately and all in common incite and exhort us to wisdom and justice and godliness and the rest of the company of virtues, with good thoughts and intentions combining wholesome words, and with words actions of true worth, that so the soul with every part of its being attuned may be an instrument making harmonious music so that life becomes a melody and a concent in which there is no faulty note.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="135"><p> Of the queen of the virtues, piety or holiness, 

we have spoken earlier and also of wisdom and temperance. Our theme must now be she whose ways are close akin to them, that is justice.
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="136"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="26"/> One and by no means an inconsiderable 

part of justice is that which is concerned with law courts and judges. This I have already<ref target="8-93-a"/>  mentioned, when I dealt at length with the question of testimony in order to omit nothing of the points involved. As it is not my custom to repeat myself unless forced to do so by the pressure of the particular occasion I will say no more about it and with only so much preface address myself to the other parts of the subject. The law tells us that we must set the 137 rules of justice in the heart and fasten them for a sign upon the hand and have them shaking before the eyes.<ref target="8-93-b"/>  The first of these is a parable indicating that the rules of justice must not be committed to



<pb n="95"/>


untrustworthy ears since no trust can be placed in the sense of hearing but that these best of all lessons must be impressed upon our lordliest part, stamped too with genuine seals.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="138"><p> The second 

shows that we must not only receive conceptions of the good but express our approval of them in unhesitating action, for the hand is the symbol of action, and on this the law bids us fasten and hang the rules of justice for a sign. Of what it is a sign he has not definitely stated because, I believe, they are a sign not of one thing but of many, practically of all the factors in human life.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="139"><p> The third means that 

always and everywhere we must have the vision of them as it were close to our eyes. And they must have vibration and movement, it continues, not to make them unstable and unsettled, but that by their motion they may provoke the sight to gain a clear discernment of them. For motion induces the use of the faculty of sight by stimulating and arousing the eyes, or rather by making them unsleepful and wakeful.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="140"><p>  He to whom it is 

given to set their image in the eye of the soul, not at rest but in motion and engaged in their natural activities, must be placed on record as a perfect man. No longer must he be ranked among the disciples and pupils but among the teachers and instructors, and he should provide as from a fountain to the young who are willing to draw therefrom a plenteous stream of discourses and doctrines. And




<pb n="97"/>


if some less courageous spirit hesitates through modesty and is slow to come near to learn, that teacher should go himself and pour into his ears as into a conduit a continuous flood of instruction until the cisterns of the soul are filled.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="141"><p> Indeed he 

must be forward to teach the principles of justice to kinsfolk and friends and all the young people at home and in the street, both when they go to their beds and when they arise, so that in every posture and every motion, in every place both private and public, not only when they are awake but when they are asleep, they may be gladdened by visions of the just.<ref target="8-97-a"/>  For there is no sweeter delight than that the soul should be charged through and through with justice, exercising itself in her eternal principles and doctrines and leaving no vacant place into which unjustice can make its way.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="142"><p> He bids 

them also write and set them forth in front of the door posts of each house and the gates in their walls,<ref target="8-97-b"/>  so that those who leave or remain at home, citizens and strangers alike, may read the inscriptions engraved on the face of the gates and keep in perpetual memory what they should say and do, careful alike to do and to allow no injustice, and when they enter their houses and again when they go forth men and women and children and servants alike may act as is due and fitting both for others and for themselves.
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="143"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="27"/> Another most admirable injunction is 


<pb n="99"/>


that nothing should be added or taken away,<ref target="8-99-a"/>  but all the laws originally ordained should be kept unaltered just as they were. For what actually happens, as we clearly see, is that it is the unjust which is added and the just which is taken away, for the wise legislator has omitted nothing which can give possession of justice whole and complete.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="144"><p> Further he suggests also that the summit of perfection<ref target="8-99-b"/>  

has been reached in each of the other virtues. For each of them is defective in nothing, complete in its self-wrought consummateness, so that if there be any adding or taking away, its whole being is changed and transformed into the opposite condition.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="145"><p><ref target="8-99-c"/> Here is an example of what I 

mean. That courage, the virtue whose field of action is what causes terror, is the knowledge of what ought to be endured,<ref target="8-99-d"/>  is known to all who are not completely devoid of learning and culture, even if their contact with education has been but small.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="146"><p> But if anyone, indulging the ignorance 

which comes from arrogance and believing himself to be a superior person capable of correcting what stands in no such need, ventures to add to or take from courage, he changes its likeness altogether and stamps upon it a form in which ugliness replaces beauty, for by adding he will make rashness and by taking away he will make cowardice, not leaving even the name of the courage so highly profitable to life.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="147"><p>  In the same way too if one 


<pb n="101"/>


adds anything small or great to the queen of virtues piety or on the other hand takes something from it, in either case he will change and transform its nature. Addition will beget superstition and subtraction will beget impiety, and so piety too is lost to sight, that sun whose rising and shining is a blessing we may well pray for, because it is the source of the greatest of blessings, since it gives the knowledge of the service of God, which we must hold as lordlier than any lordship, more royal than any sovereignty.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="148"><p> Much the same may be said

of the other virtues, but as it is my habit to avoid lengthy discussions by abridgement I will content myself with the aforesaid examples which will sufficiently indicate what is left unsaid.
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="149"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="28"/> Another commandment of general value

is “Thou shalt not remove thy neighbour’s landmarks which thy forerunners have set up.”<ref target="8-101-a"/>  Now this law, we may consider, applies not merely to allotments and boundaries of land in order to eliminate covetousness but also to the safeguarding of ancient customs. For customs are unwritten laws, the decisions approved by men of old, not inscribed on monuments nor on leaves of paper which the moth destroys, but on the souls of those who are partners in the same citizenship.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="150"><p> For

laws, since he acts under the admonition of restraint and the fear of punishment. But he who faithfully observes the unwritten deserves commendation, since the virtue which he displays is freely willed.<ref target="8-103-a"/> 
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="151"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="29"/> Some legislators have introduced the

system of filling magistracies by lot, to the detriment of their peoples, for the lot shows good luck, not merit. In fact the lot often falls to many of the unworthy whom a good man, if he obtained command, would reject as unfit to be classed even among his subjects.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="152"><p> For those “ minor rulers,” as

some phrase it, whom we call “ masters ” do not retain in their service all they might whether homebred or purchased, but only those who prove amenable: the incorrigible they sometimes sell in a mass as unworthy to be slaves of men of merit.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="153"><p> And can

it then be right to make masters and rulers of whole cities and nations out of persons chosen by lot, by what we may call a blunder of fortune,<ref target="8-103-b"/>  the uncertain and unstable?

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="154"><p> And to secure a successful voyage and the safety of

<pb n="105"/>


been carefully trained from his earliest years in the art of steersmanship. Such a one will have made many a voyage, crossed all or most seas, carefully studied the trading ports, harbours and anchorages and roadsteads, both in the islands and the mainland, and know the sea routes as well as, if not better than, the roads on land, through accurately watching the heavenly bodies.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="155"><p> For by observing the courses of

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="156"><p><ref target="8-105-b"/>  And shall one

who is to have in his hands great and populous cities with all their inhabitants, and the constitutions of the cities and the management of matters private, public and sacred, a task which we might well call an art of arts and a science of sciences, be the sport of the unstable oscillation of the lot and escape the strict test of truth, which can only be tested by proofs founded on reason?
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="157"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="30"/> These things Moses,

wise here as ever, considered in his soul and does not even mention appointment of rulers by lot, but determines to institute appointment by election. Thus he says “thou shalt establish a ruler over thyself, not a foreigner but from thy brethren,” hereby indicating that there should be a free choice and an unimpeachable scrutiny of the ruler made by the whole people with the same mind.<ref target="8-105-c"/>  And the choice will receive the further vote and seal of ratification



<pb n="107"/>


from Him who confirms all things that promote the common weal, even God who holds that the man may be called the chosen from the race, in which he is what the eye is in the body.<ref target="8-107-a"/> 
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="158"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="31"/> The

reasons subjoined to show why a foreigner should not be selected are two. First to prevent him from amassing a great quantity of gold and silver and cattle and storing up great wealth all unjustly wrung from the poverty of his subjects.<ref target="8-107-b"/>  Secondly that he should not to gratify his own greedy desires evict the natives from the land and compel them to emigrate borne hither and thither in endless wandering, or by inspiring in them futile hopes of increased prosperity succeed in taking from them what ere now they enjoyed in security.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="159"><p><ref target="8-107-c"/>  For he assumed with good

reason that one who was their fellow-tribesman and fellow-kinsman related to them by the tie which brings the highest kinship, the kinship of having one citizenship and the same law and one God who has taken all members of the nation for His portion, would never sin in the way just mentioned. He knew that such a one on the contrary, instead of

sending the inhabitants adrift, would provide a safe return for those who are scattered on foreign soil, and instead of taking the wealth of others would give liberally to the needy by making his private substance common to all.

I write them in a book in order to rewrite them straightway in my soul, and receive in my mind the imprints of a script more divine and ineffaceable.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="164"><p> Now other kings carry rods in their

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="166"><p> Equality will earn its just reward, repaid in the goodwill

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="167"><p><ref target="8-111-d"/> The other thing that I shall win is that

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="168"><p><ref target="8-113-a"/> Now the name of “royal”

which Moses is wont to give to the central road which lies midway between excess and deficiency, is also given because in a set of three the midmost holds the leading place, joining in union with itself by an indissoluble bond those on either side of it, which also serve as bodyguards to it as to a king.</p></div>

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="173"><p><milestone unit="para"/>Both these statements may be justified by clear

examples to be found in the sacred laws, examples which we do well to copy. For there was a time when Moses himself arbitrated questions of justice, labouring from morning till night, but afterwards when his father-in-law arrived and observed the vast



<pb n="117"/>


burden of affairs which oppressed him through the perpetual flood of persons who had questions to settle, he gave the excellent advice that Moses should choose delegates to judge the smaller matters and keep himself in reserve for the greater and thus allow himself time to rest.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="174"><p> Moses listened to

this truly valuable advice and chose out of the multitude the men of highest repute whom he appointed as subordinate governors and also as judges, bidding them refer the more important suits to himself.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="175"><p> A record of the course thus

taken is included in the sacred books as a lesson to each generation of rulers, first that they should not, under the impression that they are capable of surveying everything, reject the help of councillors which Moses the supremely wise and beloved of God did not reject; next that they should choose officers to act as second and third to themselves and so take care that they did not by wearing themselves out over petty matters neglect the more vital. For human nature cannot possibly reach everything.
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="176"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="34"/> I have

stated one of the two examples and must add the evidence for the second. I said that the great cases were those of the lowlier. Lowliness and weakness are attributes of the widow, the orphan and the incomer. It is to these that the supreme king who is invested with the government of all should administer justice, because according to Moses God also the ruler of the Universe has not spurned them from His jurisdiction.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="177"><p> For when

the Revealer has hymned the excellences of the Self-existent in this manner<ref target="8-117-a"/>  “God the great and



<pb n="119"/>


powerful, who has no respect to persons, will receive no gifts and executes judgement,” he proceeds to say for whom the judgement is executed—not for satraps and despots and men invested with power by land and sea, but for the “incomer,<ref target="8-119-a"/>  for orphan and widow.”</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="178"><p> For the incomer,

because he has turned his kinsfolk, who in the ordinary course of things would be his sole confederates, into mortal enemies, by coming as a pilgrim to truth and the honouring of One who alone is worthy of honour, and by leaving the mythical fables and multiplicity of sovereigns, so highly honoured by the parents and grand-parents and ancestors and blood relations of this immigrant to a better home.  For the orphan, because he has been bereft of his father and mother his natural helpers and champions, deserted by the sole force which was bound to take up his cause. For the widow because she has been deprived of her husband who took over from the parents the charge of guarding and watching over her, since for the purpose of giving protection the husband is to the wife what the parents are to the maiden.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="179"><p>  One may say that the whole Jewish race is in the

position of an orphan compared with all the nations on every side. They when misfortunes fall upon them which are not by the direct intervention of heaven are never, owing to international intercourse, unprovided with helpers who join sides with them. But the Jewish nation has none to take its part, as it lives under exceptional laws which are necessarily grave and severe, because they inculcate the highest

standard of virtue. But gravity is austere, and austerity is held in aversion by the great mass of men because they favour pleasure.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="180"><p> Nevertheless as

Moses tells us the orphan-like desolate state of his people is always an object of pity and compassion to the Ruler of the Universe whose portion it is, because it has been set apart out of the whole human race as a kind of first fruits to the Maker and Father.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="181"><p> And

the cause of this was the precious signs of righteousness and virtue shown by the founders of the race, signs which survive like imperishable plants, bearing fruit that never decays for their descendants, fruit salutary and profitable in every way, even though these descendants themselves be sinners, so long as the sins be curable and not altogether unto death.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="182"><p><ref target="8-121-a"/>   Yet let no one think that good lineage

is a perfect blessing and then neglect noble actions, but reflect that greater anger is due to one who while his parentage is of the best brings shame upon his parents by the wickedness of his ways.

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="183"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="35"/> The law lays upon anyone who has under-

taken to superintend and preside over public affairs a very just prohibition when it forbids him “to walk with fraud among the people,”<ref target="8-121-b"/>  for such conduct shows an illiberal and thoroughly slavish soul which disguises its malignant ways with hypocrisy.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="184"><p> The

ruler should preside over his subjects as a father over

his children so that he himself may be honoured in return as by true-born sons, and therefore<ref target="8-123-a"/>  good rulers may be truly called the parents of states and nations in common, since they show a fatherly and sometimes more than fatherly affection.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="185"><p> But those who assume

great power to destroy and injure their subjects should be called not rulers but enemies acting like foemen in bitter war, though indeed those who do wrong craftily are more wicked than open adversaries.

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="186"><p> Now “rule” or “command”

is a category which extends and intrudes itself, I might almost say, into every branch of life, differing only in magnitude and amount. For the relation of a king to a state is the same as that of a headman to a village, of a householder to a house, of a physician to his patients, of a general to an army, of an admiral to the marines and crews, or again of a skipper to merchant and cargo vessels or of a pilot to the seamen. All these have power both for good and for worse, but they ought to will the better, and the better is to benefit instead of injuring as many as they possibly can.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="187"><p> For this is to follow

God since He too can do both but wills the good only. This was shown both in the creation and in the ordering of the world. He called the non-existent into existence and produced order from disorder,

qualities from things devoid of quality, similarities from dissimilars, identities from the totally different, fellowship and harmony from the dissociated and discordant, equality from inequality and light from darkness.

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="192"><p> Another possible reason for sending such

cases to the priests is that the true priest is necessarily a prophet, advanced to the service of the truly Existent by virtue rather than by birth, and to a prophet nothing is unknown since he has within him a spiritual sun and unclouded rays to give him a full and clear apprehension of things unseen by sense but apprehended by the understanding.<ref target="8-127-c"/>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="195"><p><milestone unit="para"/>Since workmen or labourers are offered wages as a

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="197"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="38"/> Another excellent injunction is that no

one is to revile or abuse any other, particularly a deafmute<ref target="8-131-a"/>  who can neither perceive the wrong he suffers nor retaliate in the same way, nor on an equal footing.

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="198"><p> This offence of reviling

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="202"><p> These men, it seems to me, would in their exceeding

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="203"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="39"/><ref target="8-135-b"/> He also lays down an ordered series of

injunctions all on the same lines by forbidding them to mate their cattle with those of a different species, or to sow the vineyards for two kinds of fruit, or to wear a garment adulterated<ref target="8-135-c"/>  by weaving it from two materials. The first of these prohibitions has been mentioned in our denunciation of adulterers<ref target="8-135-d"/>  to suggest still more clearly the wickedness of conspiring against the wedlock of other people, thereby ruining the morals of the wives as well as any honest hopes of begetting a legitimate family. For by prohibiting the crossing of irrational animals with different species





<pb n="137"/>


he appears to be indirectly working towards the prevention of adultery.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="204"><p> But the law should be mentioned

also here, where the theme is justice, for we must not neglect the opportunity where possible of using the same point to bring out more than one moral. Now it is just to join together things which can associate, and the homogeneous are made for association just as the heterogeneous on the other hand cannot be blended or associated, and one who plans to bring them into abnormal companionship is unjust because he upsets a law of nature.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="205"><p> But the law in its essential

holiness shows such thoughtfulness for what is just that it does not even allow the land to be ploughed by animals of unequal strength and forbids the ass and the young bull to be yoked together for this purpose, lest the weaker partner, forced to compete with the extra power of the stronger, should break down and faint on the way.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="206"><p> It is true indeed that

the stronger, the bull, is named in the list of clean animals while the weaker, the ass, belongs to the unclean. Nevertheless the law did not grudge the help of justice to the seemingly inferior, in order, I believe, to teach judges a most indispensable lesson that they should not in their judgements set the meanly born at a disadvantage, when the point under examination is not concerned with birth but with good and bad conduct.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="207"><p>  Also similar to these two

is the last enactment in the group, which forbids wool and linen, substances differing in kind, to be woven together, for in this case not only does the difference forbid association, but also the superior strength of the one will produce a rupture rather than unification when they have to be worn.
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="208"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="40"/> Midway in the group of the three comes the


<pb n="139"/>


order not to sow the vineyard for bearing two kinds of fruit. The first reason for this is to keep things of a different kind from being mixed and confused. For sown crops have no relation to trees nor trees to sown crops and therefore nature has not appointed the same date to both for producing their annual fruits, but has assigned spring to the one for reaping the corn harvest and the end of summer to the other for gathering the fruits.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="209"><p> Thus we find that the sown

plants after their flowering wither at the same time as the trees sprout after withering. For the sown plants flower in the winter when the trees shed their leaves while on the contrary in the spring when all the sown plants are withering the trees of both types<ref target="8-139-a"/>  the cultivated and the wild are sprouting, and practically it is at the same time that the crops reach their fullness and the fruits begin to grow.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="210"><p> These two so greatly differing in their natures, their

flowerings and their seasons for gendering their own particular products he rightly put asunder and set at a distance from each other, thus reducing disorder to order. For order is akin to seemliness<ref target="8-139-b"/>  and disorder to unseemliness.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="211"><p>  The second reason

was to prevent each of the two species from hurting and being hurt in return by abstracting the nourishment from each other. For if this nourishment is divided up, as it is in times of famine and dearth, all the plants will necessarily lose all their strength and either become sterilized and completely unproductive or else bear nothing but poor fruit as a consequence



<pb n="141"/>


of the debility caused by their lack of nourishment.
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="212"><p>The third reason was that good soil

should not suffer from the pressure of two very heavy burdens, one the close unbroken density of the plants which are sown and grow on the same spot, the other the task of bearing a double crop of fruit. A single yearly tribute from a single piece of ground is enough for the owner to receive, as the same from a city is enough for a king. To attempt to levy more than one toll shows excessive avarice, and that is a vice which upsets the laws of nature.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="213"><p> And therefore the

law would say to those who are minded to gratify their covetousness by laying down seed in their vineyard “do not show yourselves inferior to kings who have subdued cities and countries by arms and military expeditions. They with an eye to the future and at the same time wishing to spare their subjects deem it best to levy one yearly tribute in order to avoid reducing them in a short space of time<ref target="8-141-a"/>  to the utmost depths of poverty.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="214"><p> But you if you

exact from the same plot in the spring its contributions of wheat and barley and in the summer the same from the fruit trees will wring the life out of it by the double taxation. For it will naturally become exhausted like an athlete who is not allowed a breathing space and a chance of rallying his forces to begin another contest.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="215"><p> But you appear to forget

too easily the injunctions which I gave for the common weal.<ref target="8-141-b"/>  If only you had remembered my instruction as to the seventh year, in which I laid it down that the holy land should be left at liberty in consideration of its six-years labours, which it underwent




<pb n="143"/>


in bearing fruit at the annual season prescribed by the laws of nature, and not be worn out by any of the husbandman’s operations, you would not, recklessly and triumphantly giving full play<ref target="8-143-a"/>  to your covetous feelings, have planned strange forms of tillage by laying down seed in land fitted for the culture of trees and particularly the vine, just to gain every year two separate revenues both unjustly earned and thus increase your property with the levy which the lawless passion of avarice has led you to exact.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="216"><p> For he who can bring himself to let his

own farms go free in the seventh year and draw no income from them in order to give the land fresh life after its labours is not the man to overload and oppress them with a double burden.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="217"><p> And therefore

of necessity I pronounced on such acquisitions that both the autumn harvest and the fruit of the sown crops were unholy and impure,<ref target="8-143-b"/>  because the life-creating spirit-force in the rich soil is so to speak throttled and strangled, and because the owner vents his wild wastefulness<ref target="8-143-c"/>  on the gifts of God in an outburst of unjust desires which he does not confine within moderate bounds.”</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="218"><p> Should not our passionate

affection go out to such enactments as these which




<pb n="145"/>


by implication restrain and shackle the mad covetous desires which beset mankind?<ref target="8-145-a"/>  For he who as a commoner has learned to shun unjust gains in the treatment of his plants will, if he becomes a king with greater matters in his charge, follow his acquired habit when he comes to deal with men and also women. He will not exact a double tribute nor wring the life out of his subjects with his imposts. For long familiar habit has the power to soften harsh temperaments and in a sense to tutor and mould them to better forms, and the better forms are those which justice imprints on the soul.
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="219"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="41"/> These laws he gives to each single person

but there are other more general commands which he addresses to the whole nation in common, advising them how to behave not only to friends and allies but also to those who renounce their alliance.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="220"><p><ref target="8-145-b"/>  For

if these revolt, he tells us, and shut themselves up within their walls your well-armed fighting force should advance with its armaments and encamp around them, then wait for a time, not letting anger have free play at the expense of reason, in order that they may take in hand what they have to do in a firmer and steadier spirit.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="221"><p> They must therefore

at once send heralds to propose terms of agreement and at the same time point out the military efficiency of the besieging power. And if their opponents repent of their rebellious conduct and give way and

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="222"><p> But if the adversaries persist in their rashness to the

point of madness, they must proceed to the attack invigorated by enthusiasm and having in the justice of their cause an invincible ally.

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="223"><p><ref target="8-147-b"/>  Then after taking the silver

and gold and the rest of the spoil they must set fire to the city and burn it up, in order that the same city may not after a breathing space rise up and renew its sedition, and also to intimidate and so admonish the neighbouring peoples, for men learn to behave wisely from the sufferings of others.  But they must spare the women,<ref target="8-147-c"/>  married and unmarried, since these do not expect to experience at their hands any of the shocks of war as in virtue of their natural weakness they have the privilege of exemption from war service.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="224"><p> All this shows clearly

that the Jewish nation is ready for agreement and




<pb n="149"/>


friendship with all like-minded nations whose intentions are peaceful, yet is not of the contemptible kind which surrenders through cowardice to wrongful aggression. When it takes up arms it distinguishes between those whose life is one of hostility and the reverse.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="225"><p> For to breathe slaughter against all,

even those who have done very little or nothing amiss, shows what I should call a savage and brutal soul, and the same may be said of counting women, whose life is naturally peaceful and domestic, to be accessories to men who have brought about the war.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="226"><p>  Indeed so great a love for justice

does the law instil into those who live under its constitution that it does not even permit the fertile soil of a hostile city to be outraged by devastation or by cutting down trees to destroy the fruits.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="227"><p><ref target="8-149-a"/>  “For

why,” it says, “do you bear a grudge against things which though lifeless are kindly in nature and produce kindly fruits? Does a tree, I ask you, show ill will to the human enemy that it should be pulled up roots and all, to punish it for ill which it has done or is ready to do to you?</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="228"><p><ref target="8-149-b"/>  On the

contrary it benefits you by providing the victors with abundance both of necessaries<ref target="8-149-c"/>  and of the comforts which ensure a life of luxury. For not only men but plants also pay tributes to their lords as the seasons come round, and theirs are the more profitable since without them life is impossible.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="229"><p> But as to the trees which have never

down at will for siege works and stakes and pales for entrenchment<ref target="8-151-a"/>  and when necessary for constructing ladders and wooden towers. For these and similar purposes will be a fitting use to which to put them.
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="230"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="42"/> So much then for the rules which come

under the head of justice. But as for justice itself what writer in verse or prose could worthily sing its praise, standing as it does superior to all that eulogy or panegyric can say? Indeed one, and that the most august, of its glories, its high lineage, would be a self-sufficient matter for praise if all the rest were left untold.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="231"><p> For the mother of justice is equality,<ref target="8-151-b"/>  as

the masters of natural philosophy<ref target="8-151-c"/>  have handed down to us, and equality is light unclouded, a spiritual sun we may truly call it, just as its opposite, inequality, in which one thing exceeds or is exceeded by another is the source and fountain of darkness.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="232"><p> All things in heaven and earth have been ordered

aright by equality under immovable laws and statutes, for who does not know that the relation of days to nights and nights to days is regulated by the sun according to intervals of proportional equality?</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="233"><p> The

dates in spring and autumn every year, whose name of equinoxes is derived from the facts observed, are so clearly marked out by nature that even the least learned perceive the equality of length in the days and nights.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="234"><p> Again are not the cycles of the moon,

as she runs her course backwards and forwards from





<pb n="153"/>


the conjunction to the full orb and from her consummation to the conjunction, regulated on the principle of equal intervals? The sum total of her phases and their sizes are exactly the same in her waxing and waning, and so correspond in both forms of quantity, namely number and magnitude.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="235"><p> And as equality has

received special honour in heaven, the purest part of all that exists, so has it also in heaven’s neighbour, the air. The fourfold partition of the year into what we call the annual seasons involves changes and alternations in the air and in these changes and alternations it shows a marvellous order in disorder. For as it is divided by an equal number of months into winter, spring, summer and autumn, three for each season, it carries the year to its fulfilment and the year, as the name ἐνιαυτός<ref target="8-153-a"/>  indicates, contains as it runs to its completion everything in itself, which it would not have been able to do if it had not accepted the law<ref target="8-153-b"/>  of the annual seasons.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="236"><p> But equality stretches

down from the celestial and aerial regions to the terrestrial too. The pure part of its being which is akin to ether it raises into the heights, but another part sun-like it sends earth-wards as a ray, a secondary brightness.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="237"><p> For all that goes amiss in our life is the

work of inequality, and all that keeps its due order is of equality, which in the universe as a whole is most properly called the cosmos,<ref target="8-153-c"/>  in cities and states is





<pb n="155"/>


democracy,<ref target="8-155-a"/>  the most law-abiding and best of constitutions, in bodies is health and in souls virtuous conduct. For inequality on the other hand is the cause of sicknesses and vices.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="238"><p> But since if one

should wish to tell in full all the praises of equality and her offspring justice the time will fail him, be his life of the longest, it seems better to me to content myself with what has been said to awake the memory in the lovers of knowledge, and to leave the rest to be recorded in their souls, the holiest dwelling place for the jewels<ref target="8-155-b"/>  of God.
