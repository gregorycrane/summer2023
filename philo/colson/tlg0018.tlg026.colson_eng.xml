<head>On Rewards and Punishments</head>
<head>(And Curses)</head>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="1"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="1"/> The oracles delivered through the prophet Moses

are of three kinds.
<note n="8.313.a">The scheme here laid down is, with a slight difference of terms, identical with that given in <hi rend="italic">Mos.</hi> ii. 46 ff. There the Pentateuch is analysed into two parts, the historical and the legislative, but the historical is divided into the creation story and the “genealogical,” a term which was applied in the grammatical schools to that part of history which is concerned with particular persons, rather than with places, dates or events. See note to that passage (vol. vi. p. 606).</note>
  The first deals with the creation of the world, the second with history and the third with legislation. The story of the creation is told throughout with an excellence worthy of the divine subject, beginning with the genesis of Heaven and ending with the framing of man. For Heaven is the most perfect of things indestructible as man of things mortal, immortal and mortal being the original components out of which the Creator wrought the world, the one created then and there to take command, the other subject, as it were, to be also created in the future.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="2"><p>  The historical part is a record of



<pb n="315"/>
good and bad lives and of the sentences passed in each generation on both, rewards in one case, punishments in the other.  The legislative part has two divisions, one in which the subject matter is more general, the other consisting of the ordinances of specific laws. On the one hand there are the ten heads or summaries which we are told were not delivered through a spokesman but were shaped high above in the air into the form of articulate speech: on the other the specific ordinances of the oracles given through the lips of a prophet.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="3"><p> All these and

further the virtues which he assigned to peace and war
<note n="8.315.a">See on <hi rend="italic">De Virt.</hi> 22.</note>
  have been discussed as fully as was needful in the preceding treatises, and I now proceed in due course to the rewards and punishments which the good and the bad have respectively to expect.
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="4"><p><milestone unit="para"/>After having schooled the citizens of his polity with

gentle instructions and exhortations and more sternly with threats and warnings he called on them to make a practical exhibition of what they had learned. They advanced as it were into the sacred arena and showed the spirit in which they would act bared ready for the contest, to the end that its sincerity might be tested beyond doubt.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="5"><p>
<note n="8.315.b">I understand this and the next section to refer to the subsequent history of the Jewish Church and nation. The Pentateuch records the laws which Moses bequeathed, the later history examples of failure or success in carrying them out. Philo, however, never works out this part, and indeed hardly ever makes any allusion to the later history. See App. p. 451,</note>
  Then it was found

that the true athletes of virtue did not disappoint the high hopes of the laws which had trained them, but the unmanly whose souls were degenerate through inbred weakness, without waiting for any stronger counter-force to overpower them, dropped down, a source of shame to themselves and derision to the

<pb n="317"/>
spectators.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="6"><p> And therefore, while the former enjoyed

the prizes and laudatory announcements and all the other tributes which are paid to the victors, the latter departed not only without a crown but with the stigma of a defeat more grievous than those sustained in the gymnastic contests. For there the athletes’ bodies are brought low but can easily stand once more erect. Here it is whole lives that fall, which once overthrown can hardly be raised up again.
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="7"><p><milestone unit="para"/>The lessons which he gives on privilege, and

honour, and on the other hand on punishments fall under heads arranged in an orderly series, individual men, families, cities, countries and nations, vast regions of the earth.
<note n="8.317.a">See note on the lacuna, § 78, App. p. 455.</note>


<milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="2"/> We must first examine what is said of honours, as both more profitable and more pleasant to listen to, and we will begin with the honour paid to each single and particular individual.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="8"><p>
<note n="8.317.b">The translation takes τήν as agreeing with τιμήν understood out of τιμαῖς. Cohn’s ἀφ᾿ for ἐφ᾿ would presumably make it agree with ἀρχήν, though his translation “we will make a beginning with the honours for single persons” points rather to the other. The translation also takes τῶν ἐν μέρει as partitive genitive after ἑκάστου, but it might possibly refer to the“ heads,” individuals, families, etc., i.e. begin among the particular heads with the honours to individuals.</note>
  The Greeks say that the primeval hero

Triptolemus
<note n="8.317.c">For Triptolemus see App. p. 451. The sequence of thought in these two sections is “just as God” (not a man as the pagan myth says) “provided the corn-seed for the body at the beginning, so he provided the seed of hope for the soul.”</note>
  borne aloft on winged dragons sowed the corn-seed over the whole earth, in order that in place of the acorns which had been their food the human race might have a kindly,
<note n="8.317.d">See note on the use of ἥμερος, § 60 App. p. 454.</note>
  wholesome and exceedingly palatable means of nourishment. Now this story like many others is a mythical fable and may be left to those whose way is to deal in marvels and cultivate sophistry rather than wisdom, and imposture rather than truth.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="9"><p> For from the



<pb n="319"/>
beginning at the first creation of all things God provided beforehand, raised from the earth, what was necessary for all living animals and particularly for the human race to which he granted sovereignty over all earthborn creatures. For none of the works of God is of later birth, but all that seems to be accomplished by human skill and industry in later time was there by the foresight of nature lying ready half made, thus justifying the saying that learning is recollection.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="10"><p>  But this is not

a point for our present discussion. What we have to consider is that most vital form of seed which the Creator sowed in the rich soil of the rational soul.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="11"><p> And the first thing thus sown is hope, the fountain

head of the lives which we lead. In hope of gain the tradesman arms himself for the manifold forms of money getting. In hope of a successful voyage the skipper crosses the wide open seas. In hope of glory the ambitious man chooses political life and the charge of public affairs. The hope of prizes and crowns moves the training athlete to endure the contests of the arena. The hope of happiness incites also the devotees of virtue to study wisdom, believing that thus they will be able to discern the nature of all that exists and to act in accordance with nature
<note n="8.319.a">With ἀκόλουθα <hi rend="italic">sc.</hi> φύσει from above—a regular Stoic expression in Philo. This is better, I think, than to take it with πρός = “agreeing with” or “tending to.” So Mangey “consentanea perfectioni,” and so apparently Cohn. With this one would expect the dative rather than πρός.</note>
  and so bring to their fullness the best types of life, the contemplative and the practical, which necessarily make their possessor a happy man.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="12"><p> Now some have acted

like enemies in war to the germs of hope, and consumed them in the fire of the vices which they have kindled in the soul or like careless husbandmen have through their laziness allowed them to perish. There

<pb n="321"/>
are others who seem to have guarded them well but have clung to self-assertion rather than piety and regarded themselves as the source of their achievements. All these are to be condemned.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="13"><p>
<note n="8.321.a">The next sections, largely repeating <hi rend="italic">De Abr.</hi> 7 ff., are based on Gen. iv. 26, where the E.V. “He called his name Enosh (A.V. Enos), then began men to call on the name of the Lord God,” appears in the LXX “He called his name Enos, he hoped to call on the name of the Lord God.” Enos being a Hebrew word for man, Philo argues that his reward for his hopefulness was that he received the name of man, i.e. the true man. See note on <hi rend="italic">De Abr.</hi> 8.</note>
 He alone

is worthy of approval who sets his hope on God both as the source to which his coming into existence itself is due and as the sole power which can keep him free from harm and destruction. What reward then is offered to the winner of the Crown in this contest? It is that living being whose nature is a mixture of the mortal and immortal, even man, not the same man nor yet another than the winner.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="14"><p>
<note n="8.321.b">i.e. not a man, and therefore not either himself or any other, but “man,” all that true manhood includes.</note>
  The Hebrew

name for him is Enos, and Enos translated into Greek is ἄνθρωπος or man. He takes the name which is common to the whole race as his personal name, a reward of special distinction implying that no one should be thought a man at all who does not set his hope on God.

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="15"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="3"/> After the victory of hope comes the second

contest, in which repentance is the champion.
<note n="8.321.c">Philo’s treatment of the story of Enoch is much the same as in the parallel passage <hi rend="italic">De Abr.</hi> 17 ff. It is based on Gen. v. 24 LXX as quoted in § 16 “he was not found because God transferred him.” E.V. “He was not, for God took him.” The chief differences are that the first part of the verse “Enoch was well pleasing to God,” is not noted here, and that “transferred,” which in <hi rend="italic">De Abr.</hi> is interpreted as a change from vice to virtue, is here taken more as “removed from familiar surroundings.” As to the interpretation given in Heb. xi. 5 “he was translated that he should not see death,” see note in vol. vi. p. 597.</note>
  Repentance has nothing of that nature which remains ever in the same stay without movement or change. It has been suddenly possessed with an ardent yearning for betterment, eager to leave its inbred covetousness and injustice and come over to soberness

<pb n="323"/>
and justice and the other virtues.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="16"><p> Repentance

also has two rewards assigned to its double achievement in abandoning the base and choosing the excellent. These rewards are a new home and a life of solitude; for he says of him who fled from the insurgency of the body to join the forces of the soul “he was not found because God transferred him.”</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="17"><p> By “transference” he clearly signifies the new home

and by “not found” the life of solitude. Very pertinently too. For if a man has really come to despise pleasures and desires and resolved in all sincerity to take his stand above the passions, he must prepare for a change of abode and flee from home and country and kinsfolk and friends without a backward glance. For great is the attraction of familiarity.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="18"><p>

We may fear that if he stays he may be cut off and captured by all the love charms which surround him and will call up visions to stir again the base practices which had lain dormant and create vivid memories of what it were well to have forgotten.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="19"><p> Many persons

in fact have come to a wiser mind by leaving their country and have been cured of their wild and frenzied cravings when sight can no longer minister to passion the images of pleasure. For when thus dissociated it must needs be treading on empty space since the stimulus of pleasure is no longer present.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="20"><p> And further if he changes his abode he

must shun great gatherings and welcome solitude. It cannot but be that even in the foreign soil there are many snares like those at home on which the shortsighted who delight in large assemblies are sure to be pinned. For a crowd is another name for everything

<pb n="325"/>
that is disorderly, indecorous, discordant, culpable, and to be carried along with the crowd is very detrimental to the virtue
<note n="8.325.a">Or taking πρός with μετοικισαμένῳ “now for the first time come to settle in the land of virtue.”</note>
  of the settler on his first arrival.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="21"><p> For just as when men are beginning to

recover from a long illness their bodies easily give way because their increase of strength is not yet firmly established, so in those whose soul is now for the first time becoming healthy the sinews of the mind are flabby and rickety, so that there is a danger that passion, which is naturally stimulated by association with the thoughtless, may break out afresh.

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="22"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="4"/> After the contest won by repentance come a

third set of rewards offered for justice.
<note n="8.325.b">The treatment of Noah here is very brief compared with <hi rend="italic">De Abr.</hi> 27–46. In particular nothing is said of the point insisted on there as ranking him with the inferior Trinity,</note>
  He who attains to justice receives two prizes, one his salvation amid the general destruction, the other his appointment to take into his charge and protection the specimens of each kind of living creatures, mated in couples to produce a second creation to make good the annihilation of the first.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="23"><p> For the

Creator judged it right that the same man should end the condemned and begin the innocent generation, thereby teaching by deeds and not by words those who deny that the world is governed by providence, that, under the law which He established in universal nature, all the myriads of the human race, if they have lived a life of injustice, are not worth a single man who has not departed from justice. This person, in whose day the great deluge took place, is called by the Greeks Deucalion and by the Hebrews Noah.
<note n="8.325.c">See App. p. 451.</note>


<pb n="327"/>
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="24"><p><milestone unit="para"/>After this Trinity comes another Trinity holier and

dearer to God, all belonging to one family. For it was a Father, a Son, a Grandson who pressed forward to the same goal of life, namely to be well pleasing to the Maker and Father of all. All that the multitudes admire, glory, wealth and pleasure, they despised, and laughed at vanity, that web woven of lies and cunningly devised to deceive the beholders.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="25"><p> Vanity

is the impostor who deifies lifeless objects, the great and formidable engine of aggression who with its scheming and trickery beguiles every city and loses no time in capturing the souls of the young. For it sets up its abode in them and remains there from earliest infancy to old age, save in the cases where God illumines them with a ray of truth—truth the antagonist of vanity who retreats before it though slowly and reluctantly vanquished by its superior power.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="26"><p> This
<note n="8.327.a">i.e. those who despise vanity.</note>
  kind is few in number but in power so

manifold and mighty that it cannot be contained by the whole compass of the earth but reaches to Heaven, possessed with an intense longing to contemplate and for ever be in the company of things divine. After investigating the whole realm of the visible to its very end, it straightway proceeds to the immaterial and conceptual, not availing itself of any of the senses but casting aside all the irrational part of the soul and employing only the part which is called mind and reasoning.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="27"><p> The leader in adopting

the godly creed, who first passed over from vanity to truth, came to his consummation by virtue gained through instruction, and he received for his reward

<pb n="329"/>
belief in God.
<note n="8.329.a">For Abraham’s faith <hi rend="italic">cf. De Abr.</hi> 262 ff.</note>
  To him who happily gifted by nature has acquired the virtue which listens to no other than itself, learns from no other, is taught by no other, the prize awarded is joy. The man of practice who by unwearied and unswerving labour has made the excellent his own has for his crown the vision of God. Belief in God, life-long joy, the perpetual vision of the Existent—what can anyone conceive more profitable or more august than these?

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="28"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="5"/> But let us look into each of them more carefully

and not be led away by mere names but with a peering eye explore the inwardness of their full meaning. Now he who has sincerely believed in God has learned to disbelieve in all else, all that is created only to perish, beginning with the forces which so loudly assert themselves in him, reasoning and sense-perception. Each of these has assigned to it a council chamber and tribunal, where they conduct their inspections, one into the conceptual, the other into the visible, one with truth, the other with opinion for its goal.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="29"><p> The instability and waywardness of opinion

is obvious in that it is based on likelihoods
<note n="8.329.b">Both in form and accent εἰκόσι may be dative of εἰκών or εἰκός. The evidently intentional connexion with εἰκών points to the former, but on the other hand εἰκότα καὶ πιθανά is a frequent collocation with Philo, e.g. στοχασταὶ . . . πιθανῶν καὶ εἰκότων, <hi rend="italic">Spec. Leg.</hi> i. 61. I imagine that Philo did not consciously parse it here, but thought of it as coming from both or either. Cohn translating εἰκόσι by “Vermutungen” and εἰκών by “Bild” entirely obscures the point.</note>
  and plausibilities, and every likeness by its deceptive resemblance falsifies the original. Reason, sense-perception’s master, who thinks itself appointed to judge things conceptual, which ever continue in the same stay, is found to be in sore trouble on many points. For when it comes to grapple with the vast

<pb n="331"/>
number of particular subjects it becomes incapable, grows exhausted and collapses like an athlete flung prostrate by superior power.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="30"><p> But he to whom it is

given to gaze and soar beyond not only material but all immaterial things, and to take God for his sole stay and support with a reasonableness whose resolution falters not, and a faith unswerving and securely founded, will be a truly happy and thrice blessed man.
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="31"><p><milestone unit="para"/>After faith comes the reward set aside for the

victorious champion who gained his virtue through nature and without a struggle. That reward is joy. For his name was in our speech “laughter” but as the Hebrews call it Isaac. Laughter is the outward and bodily sign of the unseen joy in the mind, and joy is in fact the best and noblest of the higher emotions.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="32"><p> By it the soul is filled through and through

with cheerfulness, rejoicing in the Father and Maker of all, rejoicing too in all His doings in which evil has no place, even though they do not conduce to its own pleasure, rejoicing because they are done for good and serve to preserve all that exists.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="33"><p> A physician

treating serious and dangerous diseases sometimes amputates parts of the body, hoping to secure the health of the rest, and the pilot in stormy weather casts cargo overboard to provide for the safety of the passengers. No blame attaches either to the physician for the mutilation or to the pilot for sacrifice of property, but on the contrary both are praised for looking to what is profitable rather than what is pleasant, and for having done the right thing.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="34"><p> In the

same way we must always reverence all-embracing nature and acquiesce cheerfully in its actions in the universe, free as they are from all intention of evil.

<pb n="333"/>
For the question before us is not whether the events are pleasant to us personally but whether the chariot and ship of the universe is guided in safety like a well-ordered state.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="35"><p> So he too is blessed no less than

the first named. He never knows gloom and depression; his days are passed in happy freedom from fears and grief; the hardships and squalor of life never touch him even in his dreams, because every spot in his soul is already tenanted by joy.

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="36"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="6"/> After the self-taught, the man enriched by his

natural gifts, the third to reach perfection is the Man of Practice who receives for his special reward the vision of God. For having been in touch with every side of human life and in no half-hearted familiarity with them all, and having shirked no toil or danger if thereby he might descry the truth, a quest well worthy of such love, he found mortal kind set in deep darkness spread over earth and water and the lower air and ether too. For ether and the whole Heaven wore to his eyes the semblance of night, since the whole realm of sense is without defining bounds, and the indefinite is close akin, even brother, to darkness.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="37"><p>
<note n="8.333.a">I understand this sentence to mean that <hi rend="italic">prima facie</hi> ether and heaven are of a higher nature than earth, air, and water. Still, since they also belong to αἰσθητὴ φύσις, they share the indefiniteness and darkness which is only removed by νοητά, which as he says of the “ideas,” <hi rend="italic">Spec. Leg.</hi> i. 48, “give order to the disordered, definiteness to the indefinite, bounds to the boundless, shape to the shapeless.” See on § 46 (App. p. 452).</note>
  In his former years the eyes of his soul had been

closed, but by means of continuous striving he began though slowly to open them and to break up and throw off the mist which overshadowed him. For a beam purer than ether
<note n="8.333.b">In face of what has just been said of ether, Cohn must surely be wrong in translating “a purer beam of ether.”</note>
  and incorporeal suddenly shone upon him and revealed the conceptual world

<pb n="335"/>
ruled by its charioteer.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="38"><p> That charioteer, ringed as he

was with beams of undiluted light, was beyond his sight or conjecture, for the eye was darkened by the dazzling beams. Yet in spite of the fiery stream which flooded it, his sight held its own in its unutterable longing to behold the vision.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="39"><p>
<note n="8.335.a">Cohn translates “resisted the longing,” but is this sense? <hi rend="italic">Cf. Spec. Leg.</hi> i. 37, 38, of the same subject, “the soul’s eye is dizzied by the flashing of the rays. Yet it does not therefore faintheartedly give up the task.”</note>
  The Father and

Saviour perceiving the sincerity of his yearning in pity gave power to the penetration of his eyesight and did not grudge to grant him the vision of Himself in so far as it was possible for mortal and created nature to contain it. Yet the vision only showed that He is, not what He is.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="40"><p> For this which is better

than the good, more venerable than the monad, purer than the unit, cannot be discerned by anyone else; to God alone is it permitted to apprehend God.

<milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="7"/> Now the fact that He is which can be apprehended under the name of His subsistence, is not apprehended by all or at any rate not in the best way. Some distinctly deny that there is such a thing as the Godhead. Others hesitate and fluctuate as though unable to state whether there is or not. Others whose notions about the subsistence of God are derived through habit rather than thinking from those who brought them up, believe themselves to have successfully attained to religion yet have left on it the imprint of superstition.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="41"><p>
<note n="8.335.b">For the argument in these two sections <hi rend="italic">cf. Spec. Leg.</hi> i. 33 ff., and note giving reference to other authors, vol. vii. p. 616. The statement of it given in <hi rend="italic">Leg. All.</hi> iii. 97–99 resembles this still more closely, as those who gain the knowledge of God from creation are compared as here with those who have a higher inspiration, though the example there is Moses, not Jacob.</note>
  Others again who

have had the strength through knowledge to envisage

<pb n="337"/>

For instance the twelve tribes into which the nation was divided had the same number of chieftains connected not only by membership of the same house and family but by a still more real affinity, for they were brothers with the same father, and their grandfather and great-grandfather as well as their father were the founders of the nation.</p></div>

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="61"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="11"/> In each of the three the literal story is symbolical

of a hidden meaning which demands examination.
<note n="8.349.c">The allegory of §§ 61–65, which is only concerned with the “children,” that is with the different lines of conduct shown by the three types of souls, is difficult in parts, but the general gist is as follows: (α) The soul susceptible to teaching is under many ignorant illusions, but ultimately discards them for knowledge. (β) The naturally-gifted soul does not at once develop its instinctive love of good, but only when it reaches maturity. But there comes a stage when its instinctive love of happiness asserts itself. Till then its “Esau” and “Jacob” are treated with impartiality. There is a certain likeness to <hi rend="italic">De Sac.</hi> 15–16 and <hi rend="italic">Quis Rerum</hi> 294–299. Philo did not expect much positive virtue in early life. (γ) The soul which consolidates its natural gifts and instruction by exercise produces all the virtues.</note>
  Thus everyone who is taught, when he passes over to knowledge, must abandon ignorance. Ignorance is multiform and therefore it is said of the first of the three that he was the father of many children but did not deem any of them worthy to be called his sons save one. For the learner may also be said to disown the offspring of ignorance and discard them, seeing their hostility and ill will.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="62"><p> Again naturally all

we men, before the reason in us is fully grown, lie in the borderline between vice and virtue with no bias to either side. But when the mind is fully fledged

<pb n="351"/>
when it has seen and absorbed into every part of its vitality the vision of the good, it ranges freely and wings its way to reach that vision and leaves behind good’s brother and birth-fellow evil, which also flies away straight on in the opposite direction.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="63"><p>
<note n="8.351.a">The last words are obscure. As the good is stationary, why should the evil fly away? It would be possible to take ὅ as accusative after ἀποφεύγει, i.e. the mind in flying to the good is necessarily flying from evil, but no intelligible sense can be given to τὴν ἐναντίαν ὁδόν.</note>
  This is

what underlies his saying that the possessor of a highly gifted nature was the father of twins. For the soul of every man from the first as soon as he is born bears in its womb the twins good and evil as I have said and has the vision of both before him, but, when it comes to have happiness and bliss for its lot, it inclines uniformly to the god, never swaying in the other direction nor oscillating into equilibrium between the two.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="64"><p> Once more if the soul has received a

good nature, good instruction and thirdly therewith exercise in the principles of virtue, none of them fluid and superficial, but all cemented within it, firmly impressed and strung as it were into a unity, it wins health, wins power, and to these are added the fine hue of modesty and a robust and comely form.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="65"><p>
<note n="8.351.b">Possibly he means that such health of soul leads to bodily health, or that its spiritual qualities are analogous to such bodily gifts. I do not understand the point of the “fine complexion from modesty.”</note>
  This soul through the triple excellence of

nature, learning and practice becomes the plenitude of virtues, leaving no empty room within itself where other things can enter, and it engenders sons twice six in number, the perfect number, the copy and likeness of the zodiac cycle, a source of increased

<pb n="353"/>
welfare to things here below.
<note n="8.353.a">i.e. the soul here described brings blessings or has influence for good on the world around it, as the Zodiac, the greatest of the heavenly bodies (<hi rend="italic">Spec. Leg.</hi> ii. 178, <hi rend="italic">De Som.</hi> ii. 112), has above. What these blessings are is not stated. (They may be perhaps identical with the specific qualities assigned to the twelve tribes in <hi rend="italic">De Som.</hi> ii. 31–36.) But it is enough that they have the perfection of twelve, which is perfect as the duplication of the first perfect number six, see <hi rend="italic">Spec. Leg.</hi> ii. 177. On the Zodiac see App. p. 454. At this point the allegory of the three types of soul, though alluded to incidentally in the next sentence, really ends, and we return to the main point, the “reward” to Jacob’s family, namely the headship of the tribes which expanded into the wisest of nations.</note>
  This is the household, which kept safe from harm, perfect and united both in the literal history and in the allegorical interpretation, received for its reward, as I have said, the chieftaincy of the tribes of the nation.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="66"><p> From

  examples of the

rewards assigned in the past to the good both individually and in common with others, from which anyone can easily discern those which have been left unnoticed. We have next to consider in their turn the punishments appointed for the wicked, but in a general way since this is not the time to describe particular cases.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="68"><p> At the very beginning when the

human race had not yet multiplied arose a fratricide.
<note n="8.353.c">Philo’s view of the Cain story, viz. that his punishment was to be always suffering the pains of dying yet never dead (<hi rend="italic">cf. De Virt.</hi> 200), has been stated earlier in <hi rend="italic">De Fug.</hi> 60, <hi rend="italic">De Conf.</hi> 122, and particularly <hi rend="italic">Quod Det.</hi> 177 f. As appears there, his scriptural basis is that Cain’s death is never recorded, and that the sign which God set upon him that no one should kill him really means that the mark which distinguished him was that he never was killed. Fantastic as the explanation is, it enables Philo to bring out a fine thought.</note>
  He it was who first fell under a curse, who first brought

<pb n="355"/>
the monstrous pollution of human blood upon the still pure earth, who first, when it was giving birth and growth to every kind of animals and plants and was bright with all the products of its fruitfulness, set a bar to that fruitfulness, who first armed dissolution against generation, death against life, sorrow against joy and evil against good.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="69"><p> What then could

be done to him by which he would pay the penalty he deserved, he who in a single action included everything that is violent and impious? Slay him, perhaps you will say. That is a man’s idea—man who has no eyes for the great court of justice,—for men think that death is the termination of punishment but in the divine court it is hardly the beginning.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="70"><p> Since

then the deed was without precedent, the punishment devised had to be also without precedent. What is this punishment? That he should live for ever in a state of dying and so to speak suffer a death which is deathless and unending. For there are two kinds of death, one consists in being dead, which is something either good or indifferent, the other consists in dying and that is entirely bad, more painful because more durable.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="71"><p> Death thus remains with him

perpetually; observe how that is effected. There are four passions in the soul, two concerned with the good, either at the time or in the future, that is pleasure and desire, and two concerned with evil present or expected, that is grief and fear. The pair on the good side God tore out of him by the roots so that never by any chance he should have any pleasant sensations or desire anything pleasant, and engrafted in him only the pair on the bad side, producing grief unmixed with cheerfulness and fear unrelieved.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="72"><p> For he says that he laid a curse upon the



<pb n="357"/>
fratricide that he should ever“ groan and tremble.”
<note n="8.357.a">So LXX Gen. iv. 12. The E.V. has “a fugitive and wanderer” (A.V. “vagabond”).</note>
  And he set a sign upon him that no man should slay him so that he should not die once but continue perpetually dying, as I have said, dying with anguish and distress and sufferings unceasing, and most grievous of all should be sensible of his own evil plight, feeling the weight of the present ills and foreseeing the onrush of those yet to come against which he could not guard. For hope had been torn from him, hope which God has sown in mankind that they should have a comforter to be part of their nature and give relief to the distress of all whose deeds are not beyond atonement.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="73"><p> So as a man

carried away by a torrent dreads the stream around him in which he is swept along but dreads still more the onrush of the flood from above propelling him violently and ceaselessly, but also towering high over him and threatening to engulf him, so too the ills close at hand are painful but more grievous are those which flow from fear, fear which supplies abundance of sorrows as from a fountain.

perfection of the other yet superior to its successor in two ways, one that it relaxes with its unction the aridity of our cares, the other that it goes before as a harbinger of the plenitude of good which is to be.

reservation the curses and penalties which they will deservedly suffer who disregard the holy laws of justice and piety, who have been seduced by the polytheistic creeds which finally lead to atheism and have forgotten the teaching of their race and of their fathers, in which they were trained from their earliest years to acknowledge the One in substance,

 If however they accept these

chastisements as a warning rather than as intending their perdition, if shamed into a whole-hearted conversion, they reproach themselves for going thus astray, and make a full confession and acknowledgement of all their sin,

  first within themselves with a mind so purged that their conscience is sincere and free from lurking taint, secondly with their tongues to bring their hearers to a better way, then they will find favour with God the Saviour, the Merciful, who has bestowed on mankind that peculiar and chiefest gift of kinship with His own Word, from whom as its archetype the human mind was created.</p></div>

 For even though they dwell in the uttermost parts

of the earth, in slavery to those who led them away captive, one signal, as it were, one day will bring liberty to all. This conversion in a body to virtue will strike awe into their masters, who will set them free, ashamed to rule over men better than themselves.

  Three intercessors they have to

plead for their reconciliation with the Father. One is the clemency and kindness of Him to whom they appeal, who ever prefers forgiveness to punishment. The second is the holiness of the founders of the race because with souls released from their bodies they show forth in that naked simplicity

<note n="8.419.d">This is presumably founded on Lev. xxvi. 42 “I will remember my covenant with Abraham . . . and with Isaac . . . and with Jacob.” But the idea of the departed saints acting as intercessors, which Cohn <hi rend="italic">l.c.</hi> notes as a genuinely Jewish idea, is, I think, unique in Philo. Indeed he rarely if ever suggests any conscious activity on their part. The nearest approaches to it which I have noted are in <hi rend="italic">De Sac.</hi> 5, <hi rend="italic">Quis Rerum</hi> 276 and <hi rend="italic">Mos.</hi> ii. 288.</note>
  The third is one which more than

anything else moves the loving kindness of the other two to come forward so readily, and that is the reformation working in those who are being brought to make a covenant of peace, those who after much toil have been able to pass from the pathless wild to the road which has no other goal but to find favour with God, as sons may with their father.</p></div>

  brilliance which they had enjoyed had been given them not for their own sakes but as a lesson to others, who had subverted the institutions of their fathers, and therefore grief—the very painful feeling aroused by the sight of their enemy’s good fortune—was devised as a medicine to save them from perdition.
