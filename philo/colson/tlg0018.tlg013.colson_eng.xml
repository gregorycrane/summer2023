<head>On the Confusion of Tongues</head>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="1"><p>
<milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="1"/> Enough has been said on these matters. The

next question which demands our careful consideration is the confusion of tongues and the lessons of wisdom taught by Moses thereon. For he says as follows.
<milestone unit="para"/>“And all the earth was one lip and there was one voice to all. And it came to pass as they moved from the east, they found a plain in the land of Shinar and dwelt there. And a man said to his neighbour, Come, let us make bricks and bake them with fire. And the brick became as stone to them and the clay was asphalt to them. And they said, ‘Come, let us build for ourselves a city and a tower, whose head shall be unto heaven, and let us make our name before we are scattered abroad, on the face of all the earth.’ And the Lord came down to see the city and the tower which the sons of men built. And the Lord said, ‘Behold, they have all one race and one lip, and they have begun to do this, and now nothing shall fail from them of all that they attempt to do. Come and let us go down and confuse their tongue there, that they may not understand each the voice of his neighbour.’ And the Lord scattered them abroad thence on the face of all the earth, and they

<pb n="11"/>

ceased building the city and the tower. Therefore the name of the city was called ‘Confusion,’ because the Lord confounded there the lips of the whole earth, and the Lord scattered them thence over the face of the whole earth” (Gen. xi. 1–9).

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="2"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="2"/> Persons who cherish a dislike of the institutions

of our fathers and make it their constant study to denounce and decry the Laws find in these and similar passages openings
<note n="4.11.a">Or, more literally, “means of approach to”; <hi rend="italic">cf. De Agr.</hi> 56.</note>
  as it were for their godlessness.” Can you still, “say these impious scoffers, “speak gravely of the ordinances as containing the canons of absolute truth? For see your so-called holy books contain also myths, which you regularly deride when you hear them related by others.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="3"><p> And

indeed,” they continue, “it is needless to collect the numerous examples scattered about the Law-book, as we might had we leisure to spend in exposing its failings. We have but to remind you of the instances which lie at our very feet and ready to our hand.”
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="4"><p><milestone unit="para"/> One of these we have here, which resembles

the fable told of the Aloeidae, who according to Homer the greatest and most reputed of poets planned to pile the three loftiest mountains on each other in one heap, hoping that when these were raised to the height of the upper sky they would furnish an easy road to heaven for those who wished to ascend thither. Homer’s lines on this subject run thus:
<quote>
<l>They on Olympus Ossa fain would pile,</l>
<l>On Ossa Pelion with its quivering leaves,</l>
<l>In hope thereby to climb the heights of heaven.
<note n="4.11.b">Od. xi. 315, 318.</note>
 </l></quote>
Olympus, Ossa and Pelion are names of mountains.

<pb n="13"/>
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="5"><p><milestone unit="para"/> For these the lawgiver substitutes a

tower which he represents as being built by the men of that day who wished in their folly and insolent pride to touch the heaven. Folly indeed; surely dreadful madness! For if one should lay a small foundation and build up upon it the different parts of the whole earth, rising in the form of a single pillar, it would still be divided by vast distances from the sphere of ether, particularly if we accept the view of the philosophers who inquire into such problems, all of whom are agreed that the earth is the centre of the universe.
<note n="4.13.a">See App. p. 553.</note>


</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="6"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="3"/> Another

similar story is to be found in the writings of the mythologists, telling of the days when all animals had a common language. The tale is that in old days all animals, whether on land or in water or winged, had the same language, and just as among men to-day Greeks talk with Greeks and barbarians with barbarians if they have the same tongue, so too every creature conversed with every other, about all that happened to be done to them or by them, and in this way they mourned together at misfortunes, and rejoiced together when anything of advantage came their way.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="7"><p> For since community

of language led them to impart to each other their pleasures and discomforts, both emotions were shared by them in common. As a result they gained a similarity of temperament and feeling until surfeited with the abundance of their present blessings they desired the unattainable, as so often happens, and wrecked their happiness thereon. They sent an embassy to demand immortality, asking that they might be exempted from old age and allowed to


<pb n="15"/>

enjoy the vigour of youth for ever. They pleaded that one of their fellow-creatures, that mere reptile the serpent, had already obtained this boon, since he shed his old age and renewed his youth afresh, and it was absurd that the superior beings should fare worse than the inferior, or all than the one.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="8"><p> However,

for this audacity they were punished as they deserved. For their speech at once became different, so that from that day forward they could no longer understand each other, because of the difference of the languages into which the single language which they all shared had been divided.

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="9"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="4"/> Now Moses, say the objectors, brings his

story nearer to reality and makes a distinction between reasoning and unreasoning creatures, so that the unity of language for which he vouches applies to men only. Still even this, they say, is mythical. They point out that the division of speech into a multitude of different kinds of language, which Moses calls “Confusion of tongues,” is in the story brought about as a remedy for sin, to the end that men should no longer through mutual understanding be partners in iniquity, but be deaf in a sense to each other and thus cease to act together to effect the same purposes.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="10"><p> But no good result appears to have

been attained by it. For all the same after they had been separated into different nations and no longer spoke the same tongue, land and sea were constantly full of innumerable evil deeds. For it is not the utterances of men but the presence of the same cravings for sin in the soul which causes combination in wrongdoing.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="11"><p> Indeed men who have lost their



<pb n="17"/>

tongue by mutilation do by means of nods and glances and the other attitudes and movements of the body indicate their wishes as well as the uttered word can do it. Besides a single nation in which not only language but laws and modes of life are identical often reaches such a pitch of wickedness that its misdeeds can balance the sins of the whole of mankind.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="12"><p>
<note n="4.17.a">The thought seems to be that the confusion of languages did but divide nation from nation, and a single evil nation can do all the mischief.</note>
  Again multitudes through ignorance of other

languages have failed to foresee the impending danger, and thus been caught unawares by the attacking force, while on the contrary such a knowledge has enabled them to repel the alarms and dangers which menaced them. The conclusion is that the possession of a common language does more good than harm—a conclusion confirmed by all past experience which shews that in every country, particularly where the population is indigenous, nothing has kept the inhabitants so free from disaster as uniformity of language.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="13"><p> Further the acquisition of

languages other than his own at once gives a man a high standing with those who know and speak them. They now consider him a friendly person, who brings no small evidence of fellow-feeling in his familiarity with their vocabulary, since that familiarity seems to render them secure against the chance of meeting any disastrous injury at his hands. Why then, they ask, did God wish to deprive mankind of its universal language as though it were a source of evil, when He should rather have established it firmly as a source of the utmost profit?

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="14"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="5"/> Those who take the letter of the law in its

outward sense and provide for each question as it arises the explanation which lies on the surface, will no doubt refute on their own principles the authors

<pb n="19"/>

of these insidious criticisms. But we shall take the line of allegorical interpretation not in any contentious spirit, nor seeking some means of meeting sophistry with sophistry. Rather we shall follow the chain of logical sequence,
<note n="4.19.a">The words which follow suggest that he means that each deduction from the text is logical, rather than that he takes each point of the narrative successively.</note>
  which does not admit of stumbling but easily removes any obstructions and thus allows the argument to march to its conclusion with unfaltering steps.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="15"><p>   We suggest then

that by the words “the earth was all one lip and one voice” is meant a consonance of evil deeds great and innumerable, and these include the injuries which cities and nations and countries inflict and retaliate, as well as the impious deeds which men commit, not only against each other, but against the Deity. These indeed are the wrongdoings of multitudes. But we consider also the vast multitude of ills which are found in the individual man, especially when the unison of voices within him is a disharmony tuneless and unmusical.

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="16"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="6"/> Who does

not know the calamities of fortune when poverty and disrepute combine with disease or disablement in the body, and these again are mixed with the infirmities of a soul rendered distracted by melancholy or





<pb n="21"/>

senility, or any other grievous misfortune?</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="17"><p> For

indeed a single item of this list is enough to upset and overthrow even the very stoutest, if it brings its force to bear upon him. But when the ills of body and soul and the external world unite and in serried mass, as though obedient to a single commanding voice, bear down at the same moment upon their lone victim, what misery is not insignificant beside them? When the guards fall, that which they guard must fall too.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="18"><p> Now the guards
<note n="4.21.a"><hi rend="italic">Cf. De Ebr.</hi> 201 ff.</note>
  of the body

are wealth and reputation and honours, who keep it erect and lift it on high and give it a sense of pride, just as their opposites, dishonour, disrepute and poverty are like foes who bring it crashing to the ground.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="19"><p> Again the guards of the soul are the powers

of hearing and sight and smell and taste, and the whole company of the senses and besides them health and strength of body and limb and muscle. For these serve as fortresses well-walled and stayed on firm foundations, houses within which the mind can range and dwell rejoicing, with none to hinder it from following the urges of its personality, but with free passage everywhere as on easy and open high roads.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="20"><p> But against these guards also are posted hostile

forces, disablement of the sense-organs and disease, as I have said, which often bid fair to carry the understanding over the precipice in their arms.
<milestone unit="para"/> While these calamities of fortune which work independently of us are full of pain and misery, they are far outweighed in comparison with those which spring from our deliberate volition.

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="21"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="7"/> Let

us turn, then, to where the voice of unison is the voice of our self-caused ills and consider it in its turn. Our soul, we are told, is tripartite, having one part assigned

<pb n="23"/>

to the mind and reason, one to the spirited element and one to the appetites. There is mischief working in them all, in each in relation to itself, in all in relation to each other, when the mind reaps what is sown by its follies and acts of cowardice and intemperance and injustice, and the spirited part brings to the birth its fierce and raging furies and the other evil children of its womb, and the appetite sends forth on every side desires ever
<note n="4.23.a">Or “a succession of desires” (ἀεί meaning “from time to time”).</note>
  winged by childish fancy, desires which light as chance directs on things material and immaterial.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="22"><p>
<note n="4.23.b">For this translation of the frequently recurring phrase σώματα καὶ πράγματα, various versions of which have been given in previous volumes, see note on <hi rend="italic">Quis Rerum</hi> 242 (App.).</note>
  For then, as though on

a ship crew, passengers and steersmen had conspired through some madness to sink it, the first to perish with the boat are those who planned its destruction. It stands alone as the most grievous of mischiefs and one almost past all cure—this co-operation of all the parts of the soul in sin, where, as when a nation is plague-stricken, none can have the health to heal the sufferers, but the physicians share the sickness of the common herd who lie crushed by the pestilential scourge, victims of a calamity which none can ignore.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="23"><p> We have a symbol of this dire

happening in the great deluge described in the words of the lawgiver, when the “cataracts of heaven”
<note n="4.23.c">E.V. “windows of heaven.”</note>
  poured forth the torrents of absolute wickedness in impetuous downfall and the “fountains from the earth,”
<note n="4.23.d">LXX. ἀπὸ τῆς ἀβύσσου. E.V. “from the great deep.”</note>
  that is from the body (Gen. vii. 11), spouted forth the streams of each passion, streams many and great, and these, uniting and commingling with the rainpour, in wild commotion eddied and swirled continually through the whole region of the soul




<pb n="25"/>

which formed their meeting-place.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="24"><p> “For the Lord

God,” it runs, “seeing that the wickednesses of men were multiplied on the earth, and that every man carefully purposed in his heart evil things every day,” determined to punish man, that is the mind, for his deadly misdeeds, together with the creeping and flying creatures around him and the other unreasoning multitude of untamed beasts
<note n="4.25.a">See App. p. 553.</note>
  (Gen. vi. 5–6). This punishment was the deluge.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="25"><p> For the deluge

was a letting loose of sins, a rushing torrent of iniquity where there was naught to hinder, but all things burst forth without restraint to supply abundant opportunities to those who were all readiness to take pleasure therein. And surely this punishment was suitable. For not one part only of the soul had been corrupted, so that it might be saved through the soundness of others, but nothing in it was left free from disease and corruption. For “seeing,’’ as the scripture says, that “everyone,” that is every thought and not one only, “purposed,” the upright judge awarded the penalty which the fault deserved.

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="26"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="8"/> These are they who made a confederacy at

the salt ravine. For the place of vices and passions is hollow and rough and ravine-like; salt indeed, and bitter are the pangs which it brings. The covenant of alliance which they swore was destroyed by wise Abraham, for he knew that it had not the sanctity of oaths or covenant-rites. Thus we read “all these joined their voices to come to the salt-ravine; this is the salt sea” (Gen. xiv. 3). </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="27"><p> Observe further those who were barren of wisdom  and blind in the understanding which should naturally be sharp of sight, their qualities veiled under

their name of Sodomite
<note n="4.27.a">See App. p. 553.</note>
 —how the whole people from the young men to the eldest ran round and round the house of the soul to bring dishonour and ruin on those sacred and holy Thoughts which were its guests, its guardians and sentinels; how not a single one is minded to oppose the unjust or shrink from doing injustice himself.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="28"><p> For we read that not merely some

but the “whole people surrounded the house, both young and old” (Gen. xix. 4), conspiring against the divine and holy Thoughts,

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="29"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="9"/> But Moses the prophet of God


shall meet and stem the strong current of their boldness, though, setting before them as their king their boldest and most cunning eloquence, they come rushing with united onset, though they mass their wealth of water and their tide is as the tide of a river.
“Behold,” he says, “the King of Egypt comes to the water, but thou shalt stand meeting him at the edge of the river” (Ex. vii.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="30"><p> 15). The fool, then, will

go forth to the rushing flood of the iniquities and passions, which Moses likens to a river. But the wise man in the first place gains a privilege vouchsafed to him from God, who ever stands fast, a privilege which is the congener of His power which never swerves and never wavers.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="31"><p> For it was said to

him “Stand thou here with me” (Deut. v. 31), to the end that he should put off doubt and hesitation, the qualities
<note n="4.27.d">Or “dispositions.”</note>
  of the unstable mind, and put on that surest and most stable quality, faith. This is his




<pb n="29"/>

first privilege—to stand; but secondly—strange paradox—he “meets.” For “thou shalt stand meeting” says the text, though “meet” involves the idea of motion and “stand” calls up the thought of rest.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="32"><p> Yet the two things here spoken of are not

really in conflict, but in most natural sequence to each other. For he whose constitution of mind and judgement is tranquil and firmly established will be found to oppose all those who rejoice in surge and tumult and manufacture the storm to disturb his natural capacity for calmness.

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="33"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="10"/> It is


well indeed that the opponents should meet on the lip or edge of the river. The lips are the boundaries of the mouth and a kind of hedge to the tongue and through them the stream of speech passes, when it begins its downward flow.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="34"><p> Now speech is an ally

employed by those who hate virtue and love the passions to inculcate their untenable tenets, and also by men of worth for the destruction of such doctrines and to set up beyond resistance the sovereignty of those that are better, those in whose goodness there is no deceit.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="35"><p> When, indeed, after they have let out

every reef of contentious sophistry, the opposing onset of the sage’s speech has overturned their bark and sent them to perdition, he will, as is just and fit, set in order his holy choir to sing the anthem of victory, and sweet is the melody of that song.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="36"><p> For

Israel, it says, saw the Egyptians dead on the edge of the sea (Ex. xiv. 30)—not elsewhere. And when he says “dead” he does not mean the death which is the separation of soul and body, but the destruction of unholy doctrines and of the words which their mouth and tongue and the other vocal organs gave them to use.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="37"><p>  Now the death of



<pb n="31"/>

words is silence, not the silence which well-behaved people cultivate, regarding it as a sign of modesty, for that silence is actually a power, sister to the power of speech, husbanding the fitting words till the moment for utterance comes. No, it is the un-desired silence to which those whom the strength of their opponent has reduced to exhaustion and prostration must submit, when they find no longer any argument ready to their hand.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="38"><p> For what they

handle dissolves in their hands, and what they stand on gives way beneath them, so that they must needs fall before they stand. You might compare the treadmill which is used for drawing water. In the middle are some steps and on these the labourer, when he wants to water the fields, sets his feet but cannot help slipping off, and to save himself from continually falling he grasps with his hands some firm object nearby and holding tight to it uses it as a suspender for his whole body. And so his feet serve him for hands and his hands for feet, for he keeps himself standing with the hands which we use for work, and works with his feet, on which he would naturally stand.

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="39"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="11"/> Now there are many who


though they have not the capacity to demolish by sheer force the plausible inventions
<note n="4.31.a">Or “arguments,” εὕρεσις being the technical term in rhetoric for collecting material for speech. See on <hi rend="italic">De Mig.</hi> 35.</note>
  of the sophists, because their occupation has lain continuously in active life and thus they are not trained in any high degree to deal with words, find refuge in the support of the solely Wise Being and beseech Him to become their helper. Such a one is the disciple of Moses who prays thus in the Psalms: “Let their cunning lips become speechless” (Ps. xxx. [xxxi.] 19). And how should such lips be silent, unless they were bridled by Him who alone holds speech itself as His vassal?

<pb n="33"/>

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="40"><p>
Let us flee, then, without a backward glance from the unions which are unions for sin, but hold fast to our alliance with the comrades of good sense and
knowledge. </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="41"><p>And therefore when I hear those who  say “We are all sons of one man, we are peaceful” (Gen. xlii. 11), I am filled with admiration for the harmonious concert which their words reveal. “Ah! my friends,” I would say, “how should you not hate war and love peace—you who have enrolled yourselves as children of one and the same Father, who is not mortal but immortal—God’s Man,<note n="4.32.a">This conception of the Logos recurs in §§ 62 and 146.</note> who being the Word of the Eternal must needs himself be im- perishable?”</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="42"><p> Those whose system includes many 42
origins for the family of the soul, who affiliate themselves to that evil thing called polytheism, who take
in hand to render homage some to this deity, some
to that, are the authors of tumult and strife at home
and abroad, and fill the whole of life from birth to
death with internecine wars. </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="43"><p> But those
who rejoice in the oneness of their blood and honour
one father, right reason, reverence that concert of
virtues, which is full of harmony and melody, and
live a life of calmness and fair weather. And yet
that life is not, as some suppose, an idle and ignoble
life, but one of high courage, and the edge of its
spirit is exceeding sharp to fight against those
who attempt to break treaties and ever practise the
violation of the vows they have sworn. For it is the
nature of men of peace that they prove to be men of
war, when they take the field and resist those who
would subvert the stability of the soul.

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="44"><p>

<note n="4.43.a">The course of the thought, as I understand, is this. By close examination, particularly of the senses (§§ 52, 53), we obtain a mastery of them, and thus reach the harmony of which the Captains of Num. xxxi. spoke (§ 55). This involves the conviction of the untrustworthiness of all created things, and thus brings the Captains into line with Phinehas, whose ripping up of the “woman” γένεσις meant the same thing. Thus the prize of true peace goes first to Phinehas, but also in their turn (ἑξῆς) to the Captains. Historically, of course, they are linked with Phinehas, who was their leader in the war against Midian.</note>
  that prize is given to those who, after diligent and careful scrutiny, following the more certain testimony of sight, rather than hearing, have the will to accept the faith that mortality is full of unfaith and clings only to the seeming.</p></div>

indeed is the symphony of voices here described, but most wonderful of all, exceeding every harmony, is that united universal symphony in which we find the whole people declaring with one heart, “All that God hath said we will do and hear” (Ex. xix.</p></div>

  they become quicker to meet the call to action than the call of words. For other men act after they have heard, but these under the divine inspiration say—strange inversion—that they will act first and hear afterwards, that so they may be seen to go forward to deeds of excellence, not led by teaching or instruction, but through the self-acting, self-dictated instinct of their own hearts. And when they have <hi rend="italic">done</hi>, then, as they say, they will <hi rend="italic">hear</hi>, that so they may judge their actions, whether they chime with the divine words and the sacred admonitions.

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="61"><p> We have an example of the former in these

words: “And God planted a pleasaunce in Eden towards the sun-rise” (Gen. ii. 8). That garden was not a garden of the plants of the soil, but of heavenly virtues, which out of His own incorporeal light the Planter brought to their rising, never to be extinguished.</p></div>

  (Zech. vi. 12), strangest of titles, surely, if you suppose that a being composed of soul and body is here described.

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="64"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="15"/> Of the worse kind of rising we have an

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="65"><p> “Balak,” we read,

“sent for me from Mesopotamia from the mountains from the rising saying, ‘Come hither, curse for me

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="66"><p> And this is the reason

why Balaam also dwells in “Mid-river-land,” for his understanding is submerged in the midmost depths of a river, unable to swim its way upward and lift its head above the surface. This condition is the rising of folly and the setting of reasonableness.

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="67"><p>Now these makers of a music whose harmony is

the place where vice is located serves as the initial starting-point to the fool for those activities which defy nature.

He says, “Come hither, curse me Jacob, and come hither, send thy curses upon Israel” (Num. xxiii. 7), and that is equivalent to
“Put an end to them both, the soul’s sight and the soul’s hearing, that it may neither see nor hear any true and genuine excellence.” For Israel is the type of seeing, and Jacob of hearing.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="76"><p> And would that

he might only stay for a while among them and then change his habitation, but as it is he determines to abide there.

For it were a less grievous thing if when they fell in with sins, they should count them strangers and outlanders as it were, instead of holding them to be of their own household and kin.

in the alien land” (Ex. ii. 22). Thus he uses stronger terms. His tenancy of the body is not to him merely that of the foreigner as immigrant settlers count it. To alienate himself from it, never to count it as his own, is, he holds, to give it its due.

when he speaks of the world of our senses as God’s footstool, it is for these reasons. First to shew that not in creation is to be found the cause which made it; secondly to make it plain that even the whole world does not move at its own free unshackled will, but is the standing-ground of God who steers and pilots in safety all that is. And yet to say that He uses hands or feet or any created part at all is not the true account. For God is not as man (Num. xxiii. 19). It is but the form employed merely for our instruction because we cannot get outside ourselves, but frame our conceptions of the Uncreated from our own experience.</p></div>

Quod Det.</hi> 177, <hi rend="italic">De Fuga</hi> 60.</note>
  Is not Cain, when he had begotten a son whom he called Enoch, described as founding a city to bear his son’s name (Gen. iv. 17), and thus in a sense raising a building of created and mortal things to subvert those to which has fallen the honour to be the work of a diviner architect?</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="123"><p> For Enoch is by

interpretation “thy gift,” and each of the unholy thinks that his understanding gives him his apprehension and reflections, that his eyes give him sight, his ears hearing, his nostrils smell, and the other senses the functions that belong to themselves severally, and again that the vocal organs give him speech, but God, he thinks, is either not the cause in any sense


<pb n="79"/>

or not the first cause.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="124"><p>  And therefore

Cain retained in his own keeping the firstlings of the fruits of his husbandry and offered, as we are told, merely the fruits at a later time, although he had beside him a wholesome example.

  owe their existence to the Cause which is highest and first of all.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="125"><p> The impious man thinks the opposite,

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="131"><p> 9). A grand

boast, most fitting to the evil-hating soul whose edge has been made sharp against the impious, that it receives the strength to pull down every argument which would persuade the mind to turn away from holiness. And the words are true to nature, for when the mind “returns,”
<note n="4.81.a">This is of course what the LXX. means by ἐπιστρέφειν. Philo perhaps gives it the sense of “turns round,” “is converted.”</note>
  all in it that was starting aside or turning away is brought to nothing.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="134"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="27"/> The words, “the Lord came down to see

the city and the tower” (Gen. xi. 5), must certainly be understood in a figurative sense.

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="135"><p> No, as I

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="136"><p> But God fills all things; He

contains but is not contained. To be everywhere and nowhere is His property and His alone.

He is everywhere, because He has made His powers extend through earth and water, air and heaven, and left no part of the universe without His presence, and uniting all

with all has bound them fast with invisible bonds, that they should never be loosed.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="137"><p> . . . That aspect

of Him which transcends His Potencies cannot be conceived of at all in terms of place, but only as pure being, but that Potency of His by which He made and ordered all things, while it is called God in accordance with the derivation of that name,

  holds the whole in its embrace and has interfused itself through the parts of the universe.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="138"><p> But this divine nature

which presents itself to us, as visible and comprehensible and everywhere, is in reality invisible, incomprehensible and nowhere. . . . And so we have the words “Here I stand before thou wast” (Ex. xvii.</p></div>

<note n="4.85.b">See note on <hi rend="italic">De Sac.</hi> 67.</note>
  None of the terms, then, which express movement

from place to place, whether up or down, to right or to left, forward or backward, are applicable to God in His aspect of pure being. For no such term is compatible with our conception of Him, so that He must also be incapable of displacement or change of locality.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="140"><p>  All the same Moses

who are at a long distance from the facts, should never form conclusions hastily or rely on precarious conjectures, but should come to close quarters with things, inspect them one by one and carefully envisage them. For the certitude of sight must be held as better evidence than the deceitfulness of hearing.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="141"><p> And therefore among those who live under

the best institutions a law has been enacted against giving as evidence what has been merely heard, because hearing’s tribunal has a natural bias towards corrupt judgement. In fact Moses says in his prohibitions, “Thou shalt not accept vain hearing”
(Ex. xxiii. 1), by which he does not merely mean that we must not accept a false or foolish story on hearsay, but also that as a means of giving a sure apprehension of the truth, hearing is proved to lag far behind sight and is brimful of vanity.

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="143"><p>But you must suppose that it is not this obvious and

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="144"><p> Those who

ascribe to existing things a multitude of fathers as it were and by introducing their miscellany of deities have flooded everything with ignorance and confusion, or have assigned to pleasure the function of being the aim and end of the soul, have become in very truth builders of the city of our text and of its acropolis. They pile up as in an edifice all that serves to produce that aim or end and thus differ not a whit to my mind from the harlot’s offspring, whom the law has banished from God’s congregation with the words “he that is born of a harlot shall not enter the congregation of the Lord” (Deut. xxiii. 2). For like bowmen, whose shots roam from mark to mark and who never take a skilful aim at any single point, they assume a multitude of what they falsely call sources and causes to account for the origin of the existing world and have no knowledge of the one Maker and Father of all.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="145"><p>  But they who

live in the knowledge of the One are rightly called “Sons of God,” as Moses also acknowledges when he says, “Ye are sons of the Lord God” (Deut. xiv. 1), and “God who begat thee” (<hi rend="italic">ibid</hi>, xxxii. 18), and “Is not He Himself thy father?” (<hi rend="italic">ibid</hi>. 6). Indeed with those whose soul is thus disposed it follows that they hold moral beauty to be the only good, and this serves as a counterwork engineered by veteran warriors to fight the cause which makes Pleasure the end and to subvert and overthrow it.</p></div>

<note n="4.89.a">An obvious reference to Stoics and Epicureans.</note>
  But if there

be any as yet unfit to be called a Son of God, let him press to take his place under God’s First-born, the Word, who holds the eldership among the angels, their ruler as it were. And many names are his, for he is called, “the Beginning,” and the Name of

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="148"><p> And

often indeed in the law-book we find another phrase, “sons of Israel,” hearers, that is, sons of him that sees, since hearing stands second in estimation and below sight, and the recipient of teaching is always second to him with whom realities present their forms clear to his vision and not through the medium of instruction.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="149"><p>  I bow, too, in admiration

before the mysteries revealed in the books of Kings, where it does not offend us to find described as sons of God’s psalmist David those who lived and flourished many generations afterwards (1 Kings xv. 11; 2 Kings xviii. 3),
<note n="4.91.b">See App. p. 557.</note>
  though in David’s lifetime probably not even their great-grandparents had been born. For the paternity we find ascribed to the standard-bearers of noble living, whom we think of as the fathers who begat us, is the paternity of souls raised to immortality by virtues, not of corruptible bodies.

But on them nothing that exists can usually have any effect save evil speech, though indeed even the foul tongue does not work harm to those who are its objects (for they still possess their nature unchanged), but only brings disasters beyond cure on the revilers.</p></div>

only began and were unable to reach the end of their impiety is no reason why they should not be denounced as they would had they carried out all their intentions. Therefore he speaks of their having completed the tower, though they had not done so. “The Lord,” he says, “came down to see the city and tower which they had built” already, not which they intended to build (Gen. xi. 5).

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="156"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="30"/> What proof then have we that the structure

was not already completed? First, self-evident facts. No part of the earth can possibly touch the heaven for the reason already mentioned, namely that it is just as impossible as it is for the centre to touch the circumference. Secondly, because the aether, that holy fire, is an unquenchable flame, as its very name shews, derived as it is from αἴθειν, which is a special term
<note n="4.95.a">See note on § 27.</note>
  for “burn.”</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="157"><p> This is attested by a single part

of the heavenly expanse of fire, namely the Sun, which, in spite of its great distance, sends its rays to the corners of the earth, and both earth and the naturally cold extent of air, which divides it from the sphere of heaven, is warmed or consumed by it as the case may be. For to all that is at a long distance from its course or lies at an angle to it, it merely gives warmth, but all that is near it or directly under it it actually destroys with the force of its flames. If this is so, the men who ventured on the ascent could not fail to be blasted and consumed by the fire, leaving their vaulting ambition unfulfilled.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="158"><p> That it was unfulfilled

  seems to be suggested by

Moses in the words which follow. “They ceased,”



<pb n="97"/>

he says, “building the city and the tower” (Gen. xi. 8), obviously not because they had finished it, but because they were prevented from completing it by the confusion that fell upon them.
<milestone unit="para"/>Yet as the enterprise was not only planned but undertaken, they have not escaped the guilt which would attend its accomplishment.

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="159"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="31"/> We have

a parallel in Balaam, that dealer in auguries and prodigies and in the vanity of unfounded conjectures, for the name Balaam is by interpretation “vain.”
The law-book declares that he cursed the Man of Vision, though in words he uttered prayers of blessing, for it considers not what he actually said, words restamped under God’s providence, like a true coin substituted for the false, but his heart, in which he cherished thoughts of injury rather than of benefit. There is a natural hostility between conjecture and truth, between vanity and knowledge, and between the divination which has no true inspiration and sound sober wisdom.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="160"><p> And indeed if a

man makes a treacherous attempt against another’s life, but is unable to kill him, he is none the less liable to the penalty of the homicide, as is shewn by the law enacted for such cases. “If,” it runs, “a man attacks his neighbour to kill him by guile and flees to refuge, thou shalt take him from the altar to put him to death” (Ex. xxi. 14). And yet he merely “attacks” him and has not killed him, but the law regards the purpose of murder as a crime equal to murder itself, and so, even though he takes sanctuary, it does not grant him the privileges of sanctuary, but bids him be taken even from the




<pb n="99"/>

holy place, because the purpose he has harboured is unholy.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="161"><p> Its unholiness does not merely consist in

this, that it plans death to be dealt by the arm of wickedness against the soul which might live for ever by the acquisition and practice of virtue, but in that it lays its abominable audacity to the charge of God. For the words “flee to refuge” lead us to the reflexion that there are many who, wishing to shirk all charges to which they are liable and claiming to escape the penalties of their misdeeds, ascribe the guilty responsibility,
<note n="4.99.a">ἄγος implies guilt which demands, and is felt to demand, expiation.</note>
  which really belongs to themselves, to God who is the cause of nothing evil, but of all that is good. And therefore it was held no sacrilege to drag such as these from the very altar.
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="162"><p><milestone unit="para"/>The punishment which he decrees against those

who “build” up and weld together arguments for godlessness is indeed extreme, though perhaps some foolish people will imagine it to be beneficial rather than injurious. “Nothing shall fail from them of all that they attempt to do,” it says (Gen. xi. 6). What a misery, transcending limitation and measurement, that everything which the mind in its utter infatuation attempts should be its obedient vassal not backward in any service whether great or small, but hastening as it were to anticipate its every need.

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="163"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="32"/> This is a sign of a soul lacking good sense,

which finds no obstacle in all that lies between it and its sin. For he who is not far gone in mortal error would pray that all the promptings of his mind’s purposes should fail him, so that when he attempts to commit theft or adultery, or murder or sacrilege, or any similar deed, he should not find an easy path,


<pb n="101"/>

but rather a host of obstacles to hinder its execution. For if he is prevented, he is rid of that supreme malady, injustice, but if he carries out his purpose in security that malady will be upon him.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="164"><p> Why then

do you continue to envy and admire the fortunes of tyrants,
<note n="4.101.a">See App. p. 558.</note>
  which enable them to achieve with ease all that the madness and brutal savagery of their minds conceive, and hold them blessed, when rather our hearts should bewail them, since poverty and bodily weakness are a positive benefit to the bad, just as abundance of means and strength are most useful to the good?</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="165"><p> One of the foolish

who saw to what a pitch of misery free licence to sin leads said boldly, “That I should be let free is the greater indictment
<note n="4.101.b">Or perhaps “punishment,” as Philo understands the word. The text has been expounded in the same sense in <hi rend="italic">Quod Det</hi>. 141. E.V. “My punishment is greater than I can bear.”</note>
 ” (Gen. iv. 13). For it is a terrible thing that the soul, so wild as it is by nature, should be suffered to go unbridled, when even under the rein and with the whip in full play it can hardly be controlled and made docile.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="166"><p> And therefore the

merciful God has delivered an oracle full of loving-kindness
which has a message of good hope to the lovers of discipline. It is to this purport. “I will not let thee go nor will I abandon thee” (Josh. i. 5). For when the bonds of the soul which held it fast are loosened, there follows the greatest of disasters, even to be abandoned by .God who has encircled all things with the adamantine chains of His potencies and willed that thus bound tight and fast they should never be unloosed.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="167"><p> Further in another place he says, “All

that are bound with a bond are clean” (Num. xix. 15), for unbinding is the cause of destruction which is


<pb n="103"/>

unclean. Never then, when you see any of the wicked accomplishing with ease whatsoever he attempts, admire him for his success, but contrariwise pity him for his ill-luck, for his is a life of continual barrenness in virtue and fruitfulness in vice.

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="168"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="33"/> We should give careful consideration to

the question of what is implied by the words which are put into the mouth of God. “Come and let us go down and confuse their tongue there” (Gen, xi. 7). For it is clear that He is conversing with some persons whom He treats as His fellow-workers, and we find the same in an earlier passage of the formation of man.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="169"><p> Here we have “The Lord God

said ‘let us make man in our own image and likeness’ ”
(Gen, i. 26); where the words “let us make” imply plurality. And once more, “God said, ‘behold Adam has become as one of us by knowing good and evil’ ” (Gen. iii. 22); here the “us” in “as one of us” is said not of one, but of more than one.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="170"><p> Now we must

first lay down that no existing thing is of equal honour to God and that there is only one sovereign and ruler and king, who alone may direct and dispose of all things. For the lines:

<l>Be there but one, one king,
<note n="4.103.a"><hi rend="italic">Iliad</hi>, ii. 204, 205.</note>

could be said with more justice of the world and of God than of cities and men. For being one it must needs have one maker and father and master.

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="171"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="34"/> Having reached agreement on

this preliminary question our next step will be to gather the relevant considerations into a coherent argument. Let us consider what these are. God is one, but He has around Him numberless Potencies,

<pb n="105"/>

which all assist and protect created being, and among them are included the powers of chastisement. Now chastisement is not a thing of harm or mischief, but a preventive and correction of sin.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="172"><p> Through these

Potencies the incorporeal and intelligible world was framed, the archetype of this phenomenal world, that being a system of invisible ideal forms, as this is of visible material bodies.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="173"><p> Now the nature of

these two worlds has so struck with awe the minds of some, that they have deified not merely each of them as a whole,
<note n="4.105.a">See App. p. 558.</note>
  but also their fairest parts, the sun, the moon and the whole sky,
<note n="4.105.b"><hi rend="italic">Cf.</hi> Deut. iv. 19, which Philo probably has in mind.</note>
  and have felt no shame in calling them gods. It was the delusion of such persons that Moses saw, when he says “Lord, Lord, King of the Gods”
<note n="4.105.c">Very inaccurately quoted for ὁ κύριος ὁ θεὸς ὑμῶν, οὗτος θεὸς τῶν θεῶν.</note>
  (Deut. x. 17), to shew the difference between the ruler and the subjects.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="174"><p>  There is, too, in the air a sacred company of unbodied

souls, commonly called angels in the inspired pages, who wait upon these heavenly powers. So the whole army composed of the several contingents, each marshalled in their proper ranks, have as their business to serve and minister to the word of the Captain who thus marshalled them, and to follow His leadership as right and the law of service demand. For it must not be that God’s soldiers should ever be guilty of desertion from the ranks.</p></div>

  Now the King may fitly

hold converse with his powers and employ them to serve in matters which should not be consummated by God alone. It is true indeed that the Father of

All has no need of aught, so that He should require the co-operation of others, if He wills some creative work, yet seeing what was fitting to Himself and the world which was coming into being, He allowed His subject powers to have the fashioning of some things, though He did not give them sovereign and independent knowledge for completion of the task, lest aught of what was coming into being should be miscreated.

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="176"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="35"/> This outline was


needed as premisses. Now for the inferences. Living nature was primarily divided into two opposite parts, the unreasoning and reasoning, this last again into the mortal and immortal species, the mortal being that of men, the immortal that of unbodied souls which range through the air and sky.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="177"><p> These

are immune from wickedness because their lot from the first has been one of unmixed happiness, and they have not been imprisoned in that dwelling-place of endless calamities—the body. And this immunity is shared by unreasoning natures, because, as they have no gift of understanding, they are also not guilty of wrongdoing willed freely as a result of deliberate reflection.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="178"><p> Man is practically the only

being who having knowledge of good and evil often chooses the worst, and shuns what should be the object of his efforts, and thus he stands apart as convicted of sin deliberate and aforethought.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="179"><p>  Thus it was meet and right that when man was

formed, God should assign a share in the work to His lieutenants, as He does with the words “let <hi rend="italic">us</hi> make men,” that so man’s right actions might be attributable




<pb n="109"/>

to God, but his sins to others. For it seemed to be unfitting to God the All-ruler that the road to wickedness within the reasonable soul should be of His making, and therefore He delegated the forming of this part to His inferiors. For the work of forming the voluntary element to balance the involuntary had to be accomplished to render the whole complete.

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="180"><p><milestone unit="para"/> <milestone unit="altchapter" n="36"/> So much for this point, but

it is well to have considered this truth also, that God is the cause of good things only and of nothing at all that is bad, since He Himself was the most ancient of beings and the good in its most perfect form. And it best becomes Him that the work of His hands should be akin to His nature, surpassing in excellence even as He surpasses, but that the chastisement of the wicked should be assured through His underlings.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="181"><p> My thoughts are attested also by the words

of him who was made perfect through practice, “the God who nourisheth me from my youth; the angel who saveth me from all evils” (Gen. xlviii. 15, 16). For he, too, hereby confesses that the truly good gifts, which nourish virtue-loving souls, are referred to God alone as their cause, but on the other hand the province of things evil has been committed to angels (though neither have they full and absolute power of punishment), that nothing which tends to destruction should have its origin in Him whose nature is to save.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="182"><p> Therefore he says, “Come and

let us go down and confound them.” The impious indeed deserve to have it as their punishment, that God’s beneficent and merciful and bountiful powers should be brought into association with works of vengeance. Yet, though knowing that punishment was salutary for the human race, He decreed that it

<pb n="111"/>

should be exacted by others.
<note n="4.111.a">Philo here seems to assign the work of punishment to the lower division of the ministers rather than to the Potencies, though elsewhere he treats it as belonging to the Kingly Potency indicated by the name of ὁ Κύριος, <hi rend="italic">e.g. De Abr.</hi> 144, 145. Here the “angels” have the whole province of evil assigned to them, whether to save from it, as with Jacob, or to inflict it.</note>
  It was meet that while mankind was judged to deserve correction, the fountains of God’s ever-flowing gifts of grace should be kept free not only from all that is, but from all that is deemed to be, evil.

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="183"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="37"/> We must now inquire what is meant by

“confusion.” What should be our method? The following in my opinion. We often obtain a knowledge of persons whom we have not known before from their kinsfolk or those who bear some resemblance to them. And so in the same way things which in themselves are not easy to apprehend may reveal their nature through their likeness to their congeners.
<note n="4.111.b">See App. p. 558 on this and the following sections.</note>
  What things then resemble confusion?</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="184"><p>

“Mechanical mixture,” to use the old philosophical term, and “chemical mixture.” The first presents itself for examination in dry substances, the latter in liquid.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="185"><p> Mechanical mixture of different bodies

occurs when they are juxtaposed in no regular order, as when we collect barley and wheat and pulse or any other kind of grain and pile them together. Chemical mixture is not juxtaposition, but the mutual coextension and complete interpenetration of dissimilar parts, though their various qualities can still be distinguished by artificial means, as is said to be the case with water and wine.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="186"><p> These substances

if united do produce, we are told, a chemical mixture, but all the same that mixture can be resolved
<note n="4.111.c">See App. p. 558.</note>
  into the different qualities out of which it was composed. A sponge dipped in oil will absorb the water and leave the wine. Probably the explanation is that



<pb n="113"/>

since the sponge is produced out of water, it tends to absorb out of the mixture the substance which is akin to it, the water, and leave the foreign substance, the wine.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="187"><p> But confusion is the annihilation
<note n="4.113.a">See App. p. 558.</note>



of the original varieties or qualities, which become coextensive through all the parts and thus produce a single and quite different quality. An example of this is the quadruple drug used in medicine. This is produced, I believe, by the combination of wax, tallow, pitch and resin, but, when the compound has been formed, it is impossible to analyse or separate the properties which went to form it. Each of them has been annihilated, and from this loss of identity in each has sprung another single something with properties peculiar to itself.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="188"><p>
<note n="4.113.b">Lit. “another single special power.” This use of δύναμις which suggests both “nature” and “value” cannot be translated by any single or at least any singular word. For this use of ἐξαίρετος <hi rend="italic">cf. De Op.</hi> 62, where the senses have each their ἐξαίρετος ὕλη.</note>
  But

when God threatens impious thoughts with confusion He does not order merely the annihilation of the specific nature and properties of each separate vice. The order applies also to the aggregate to which they have contributed. He means that neither their separate parts, nor yet their united body and voice, shall be invested with strength to destroy the better element.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="189"><p> And therefore he says, “Let us confound

their tongue there, that each of them may not understand the voice of his neighbour” (Gen. xi. 7), and this is equivalent to “let us make each part of vice mute that it may not by its separate utterance nor yet in unison with the others be the cause of mischief.”

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="190"><p><milestone unit="para"/> <milestone unit="altchapter" n="38"/> This is our explanation,

but those who merely follow the outward and obvious think that we have at this point a reference to the origin of the Greek and barbarian languages. I


<pb n="115"/>

would not censure such persons, for perhaps the truth is with them also. Still I would exhort them not to halt there, but to press on to allegorical interpretations and to recognize that the letter is to the oracle but as the shadow to the substance and that the higher values therein revealed are what really and truly exist.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="191"><p> Indeed the lawgiver himself gives

openings for this kind of treatment to those whose understanding is not blinded, as he certainly does in the case now under discussion, when he calls what was then taking place a “confusion,”
Surely if he had merely meant that different languages then originated, he would have applied a more correct term and called it “separation” rather than “confusion.” For when things are divided they are not “confused,” but quite the contrary, “separated.” And the contradiction is not merely one of name but of fact.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="192"><p> Confusion—the process of fusing

together—is, as I have said, the annihilation of the individual properties, and the production thereby of a single whole with its own properties,
<note n="4.115.a">Or more literally “the destruction of the simple uncompounded natures, to produce a single compounded nature.”</note>
  whereas separation is the division of one into several, as in the case of genus and the species, which form the genus. And therefore if the Sage’s
<note n="4.115.b">i.e. Moses, not God. Philo often calls God ὁ μόνος σοφός, but not ὁ σοφός. The command is thought of as emanating from Moses, because the language in which it is clothed is his.</note>
  command was to divide speech, the single whole, by section into several languages, he would have used more apposite and exact terms such as dissection or distribution or separation, and not their opposite, confusion.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="193"><p> But

his purpose and desire is to break up the company of vice, to make her agreements of none effect, to do away with her fellowship, to annihilate and destroy her powers, to overthrow the might of her queenship which by her abominable transgressions she had

<pb n="117"/>

made so strong.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="194"><p> Observe that he who


fashioned the living being, brought none of its parts into fellowship with any other. The eyes cannot hear, nor the ears see; the palatal juices cannot smell, nor the nostrils taste; nor again can speech have any of the sensations which the senses produce, just as on the other hand the senses have no power of utterance.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="195"><p> For the great Contriver knew that it

was well for them that none should hear the voice of his neighbour. He willed rather in the interests of animal life, that each part of the living organism should have the use of its own particular powers without confusion with others, and that fellowship of part with part should be withdrawn from them, while on the other hand the parts of vice should be brought into confusion and complete annihilation, so that neither in unison nor separately by themselves should they become a source of injury to their betters.
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="196"><p><milestone unit="para"/>That is why he adds—The Lord dispersed them

thence (Gen. xi. 8), that is He caused them to be scattered, to be fugitives, to vanish from sight. For while sowing is the cause of good, dispersing or sowing broadcast is the cause of ill. The purpose of the first is to improve, to increase, to create something else; the purpose of the second is to ruin and destroy. But God the Master-planter wills to sow noble living throughout the All, and to disperse and banish from the Commonwealth of the world the impiety which He holds accursed. Thus the evil ways which hate virtue may at last cease to build the city of vice and the tower of godlessness.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="197"><p> For

when these are scattered, those who have been living in exile for many a day under the ban of folly’s tyranny, shall receive their recall under a single

<pb n="119"/>

proclamation, even the proclamation enacted and ratified by God, as the oracles shew, in which it is declared that “if thy dispersion be from one end of heaven to the other he shall gather thee from thence”
(Deut. xxx.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="198"><p> 4). Thus it is a work well-befitting to

God to bring into full harmony the consonance of the virtues, but to dissipate and destroy the consonance of vices. Yes, confusion is indeed a most proper name for vice, and a standing evidence of this is every fool, whose words and purposes and deeds alike are worthless and unstable.
