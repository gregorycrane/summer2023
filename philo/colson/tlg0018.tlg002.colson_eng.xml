<milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="1"/> “And the heaven and the earth and all their world were completed” (Gen. ii. 1). He had already told of the creation of mind and sense-perception;
he now fully sets forth the consummation of both. He does not say that either the individual mind or the particular sense-perception have reached completion, but that the originals have done so, that of mind and that of sense-perception. For using symbolical language he calls the mind heaven, since heaven is the abode of natures discerned only by mind, but sense-perception he calls earth, because sense-perception possesses a composition of a more earthly and body-like sort.
“World,”
<note n="1.147.a">κόσμος = “order” or “world.” Philo takes it in the latter sense. E.V. “host.”</note>
  in the case of mind, means all incorporeal things, things discerned by mind alone: in the case of sense-perception it denotes things in bodily form and generally whatever sense perceives.
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="2"><p> <milestone unit="altchapter" n="2"/> “And God finished on the sixth
<note n="1.147.b">6th. So LXX. E.V. 7th.</note>
  day His works which He had made” (Gen. ii. 2). 
  
  It is quite foolish to think that the world was created in six days or in a space of time at all. Why? Because every period of time is a series of days and nights, and these can only be made such by the movement of the sun as it goes over and under the earth: but

<pb n="149"/>

the sun is a part of heaven, so that time is confessedly more recent than the world. It would therefore be correct to say that the world was not made in time, but that time was formed by means of the world, for it was heaven’s movement that was the index of the nature of time. </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="3"><p>When, then, Moses says, “He finished His work on the sixth day,” we must understand him to be adducing not a quantity of days, but a perfect number, namely six, since it is the first that is equal to the sum of its own fractions ½, ⅓, and 1/6, and is produced by the multiplication of two unequal factors,
<note n="1.149.a">See App. p. 477.</note>
  2 × 3; and see, the numbers 2 and 3 have left behind the incorporeal character that belongs to 1, 2 being an image of matter, and being parted and divided as that is, while 3 is the image of a solid body, for the solid is patient of a threefold division.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="4"><p>
   Nay more, the number 6 is akin to the movements of animals provided with instrumental limbs,
<note n="1.149.b">Aristotle, <hi rend="italic">Ethics</hi> iii. 1. 6, and Grant’s note.</note>
  for the body equipped with such instruments is so constituted by nature that it can move in six directions, forwards and backwards, upwards and downwards, to the right and to the left. Moses’ wish, therefore, is to exhibit alike the things created of mortal kind and those that are incorruptible as having been formed in a way corresponding to their proper numbers. As I have just said, he makes mortal things parallel with the number six, the happy and blessed things with the number seven. </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="5"><p>
First of all, then, on the seventh day the Creator, having brought to an end the formation of mortal things, begins the shaping of others more divine.
<milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="3"/> For God never leaves off making, but even as it is the property of fire to burn and of snow to chill, so it is the property of God to make: nay more so

by far, inasmuch as He is to all besides the source of action. </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="6"><p>Excellently, moreover, does Moses say “caused to rest” not “rested”; for He causes to rest that which, though actually not in operation, is apparently making, but He Himself never ceases making. For this reason Moses adds after “He caused to rest” the words “from what He had begun.” For whereas things produced by human arts when finished stand still and remain as they are, the products of divine skill, when completed, begin again to move; for their endings are the beginnings of other things, as the end of day is the beginning of night, and the openings of a month and of a year must naturally be regarded as limits which close those which have elapsed: </p></div>

  Nature takes delight in the number seven. Thus there are seven planets, the counterpoise to the uniform movement of the fixed stars. It is in seven stars that the bear reaches completeness, and gives rise not to commerce only but to fellowship and unity among men. The changes of the moon, again, occur by sevens: this is the luminary most sympathetic to earthly matters. And such changes as Nature produces in the atmosphere, she effects mainly by the influence of figures dominated by seven.
<note n="1.151.c">The reference is to the Planets (<hi rend="italic">De Op</hi>. 113), to the Pleiades (115), whose settings and risings rule sowing and reaping, and to the Equinoxes (116). The subject of ἐργάζεται is ἡ φύσις at the opening of the section.</note>
  </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="9"><p>Indeed,


<pb n="153"/>

all that concerns us mortals has a divine origin drawn from heaven and is for our weal when its movement is ruled by seven. Who does not know that seven months’ infants come to the birth, while those that have taken a longer time, remaining in the womb eight months, are as a rule still-born? </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="10"><p>And they say that man becomes a reasoning being during his first seven years, by which time he is already capable of expressing ordinary nouns and verbs through having acquired the reasoning faculty; and that during his second period of seven years he reaches complete consummation; consummation meaning the power of reproducing his like; for at about the age of fourteen we are able to beget offspring like ourselves. The third period of seven years, again, is the end of growth, for till the age of twenty-one years men increase in height, and by many this time is called his prime. </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="11"><p>Furthermore the unreasoning side of the soul consists of seven parts, five senses, and the organ of speech, and the genital organ. </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="12"><p>The body again has seven movements, six mechanical, the seventh circular. Seven also are the internal organs, stomach, heart, spleen, liver, lung, two kidneys. Of equal number in like number are the divisions of the body—head,
neck, breast, hands, belly, abdomen, feet. And the face, the living creature’s noblest part, is pierced by seven apertures, by two eyes, and two ears, as many nostrils, and the mouth, which make up seven.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="13"><p> The excrements are seven—tears, mucus, spittle, seed, superfluities discharged by two ducts, and the sweat that oozes from all over the body. Once again in diseases the seventh is the most critical day. And the monthly purgings of women extend to seven days.

<milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="5"/> The power

<pb n="155"/>

of this number reaches also to the most beneficent of the arts: in grammar, for instance, the best and most effective of the letters, namely the vowels, are seven in number; in music we may fairly call the seven-stringed lyre the best of instruments, because the enharmonic genus, which as we know is the most dignified of those used in melodies, is best brought out when that instrument renders it. Sevenfold are the modulations in pronunciation—acute, grave, circumflex, aspirated and unaspirated, long, short. </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="15"><p>Further, seven is the first number after the perfect number six, and the same in some sort with the number one. Whereas other numbers within the decade are either produced by or produce those within the decade and the decade itself, the number seven neither produces any of the numbers within the decade nor is produced by any. By reason of this the Pythagoreans, indulging in myth, liken seven to the motherless and ever-virgin Maiden, because neither was she born of the womb nor shall she ever bear.

<milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="6"/> “He rested
<note n="1.155.a">Literally, “caused to rest.”</note>
  therefore on the seventh day from all His works which He had made” (Gen. ii. 2).</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="17"><p> This is as much as to say that God ceases moulding the masses that are mortal, whenever He begins to make those that are divine and in keeping with the nature of seven. But the interpretation of the statement in accordance with its bearing on human life and character is this, that, whenever there comes upon the soul the holy Reason of which Seven is the keynote, six together with all mortal things that the soul seems to make therewith comes to a stop.
<milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="7"/> “And God blessed the seventh day and


<pb n="157"/>

hallowed it” (Gen. ii. 3). God both blesses and forthwith makes holy the dispositions set in motion in harmony with the seventh and truly Divine light, for closely akin are the character that is charged with benediction
<note n="1.157.a">Philo dwells on the connexion between εὐλογεῖν (lit. “say well done” or “well be it,” εὖ) and εὐλόγιστος (“happy in the use of reason or of speech”) and builds an ethical interpretation of the passage on this connexion.</note>
  and the character that is holy. That is why, when treating of him who has vowed the great vow,
<note n="1.157.b">See Numb. vi. 2.</note>
  he says that, if a change suddenly befall him and defile his mind,
<note n="1.157.c">Such is Philo’s interpretation of the Nazirite touching a corpse.</note>
  he shall no longer be holy, but “the preceding days are not reckoned.”
<note n="1.157.d">“Not reckoned” (ἄλογος) suggest “not taken into account” (ἀλόγιστος), which is the direct opposite of “well accounted of,” a meaning that might be given to εὐλόγιστος.</note>
  Rightly enough, for the character that is not holy is vile, of no account, so that the character well accounted of is holy.
  
  </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="18"><p> Rightly, then, did he say that God both blessed and hallowed the seventh day, “because in it He ceased
<note n="1.157.e">Strictly “caused to cease.”</note>
  from all His works which God began to make” (Gen. ii. 3). But the reason why the man that guides himself in accordance with the seventh and perfect light is both of good understanding
<note n="1.157.f">Or “blessed.”</note>
  and holy, is that the formation of things mortal ceases with this day’s advent. For, indeed, the matter stands thus; when that most brilliant and truly divine light of virtue has dawned, the creation of that whose nature is of the contrary kind comes to a stop. But we pointed out that God when ceasing or rather causing to cease, does not cease making, but begins the creating of other things, since He is not a mere artificer, but also Father of the things that are coming into being.
<note n="1.157.g">This ceaseless action of God as Father, by the operation of the all-permeating Spirit, Philo finds implied in Gen. ii. 3.</note>

<milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="8"/> “This book is that of the origin of heaven and earth, when it came into being” (Gen. ii. 4).





<pb n="159"/>

(That is to say): “This perfect Reason,
<note n="1.159.a">Philo can identify the Book with Reason, since λόγος can mean Reason as well as Word.</note>
  moving in accord with the number 7, is the primal origin both of mind ordering itself after the original patterns, and of sense-perception in the domain of mind
<note n="1.159.b">“Sense-perception” has its function in the material sphere. It cannot strictly be spoken of as acting in the domain of mind or pure intellect.</note>
  (if the expression is permissible) ordering itself after those originals.” “Book” is Moses’ name for the Reason of God, in which have been inscribed and engraved the formation of all else. </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="20"><p>But that you may not suppose that the Deity makes anything in definite periods of time, but may know that to mortal kind the process of creation is unobserved, un-descried,
incomprehensible, he adds, “When it came into being,” not defining “when” by a determining limit, for the things that come into being under the hand of the First Cause come into being with no determining limit. There is an end, then, of the notion that the universe came into being in six days.
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="21"><p> 
<milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="9"/> “In the day in which God made the heaven and the earth and every green thing of the field before it appeared upon the earth and all grass of the field before it sprang up; for God had not sent rain on the earth, and there was no man to till the earth”
(Gen. ii. 4, 5). Above he has called this day a book, for he delineates the creation of heaven and earth as wrought in both: for by His own supremely manifest and far-shining Reason God makes both of them, both the original of the mind, which in symbolic language he calls “heaven,” and the original of sense-perception, to which by a figure he gave the name of
“earth.” </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="22"><p>And he compares the original of the mind and the original of sense-perception to two fields; for they bear fruit, the mind all that is done in thinking, sense-perception all that is done in perceiving.

<pb n="161"/>

What he means is something of this sort. As before the particular and individual mind there subsists a certain original as an archetype and pattern of it, and again before the particular sense-perception, a certain original of sense-perception related to the particular as a seal making impression is to the form which it makes; just so, before the individual objects of intellectual perception came into being, there was existing as a genus the ‘intellectually-perceptible’ itself, by participation in which the name has been given to the members of the genus; and before the individual objects of sense-perception came into existence, there was existing as a genus the ‘sensibly-perceptible’ itself, by sharing in whose being all other objects of sense have become such. 

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="23"><p>“Green of the field,”
then, is what he terms the “intellectually-perceptible” of the mind; for as in a field the green things spring up and bloom, even so the ‘intellectually-perceptible’
is a growth springing from the mind. Before, then, the particular ‘intellectually-perceptible’ came into being, the Creator produces the solely abstract ‘intellectually-perceptible,’ as a generic existence. This he rightly calls “all,” for the particular ‘intellectually-perceptible,’ being a fragment, is not all, but the generic is so, being a full whole.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="24"><p>
<milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="10"/> “And all the grass of the field”
he says, “before it sprang up,” that is to say, before the particular objects of sense sprang up, there existed by the Maker’s forethought the generic ‘sensibly-perceptible,’ and that it is that he again calls “all.” Natural enough is his comparison of the ‘sensibly-perceptible’ to grass. For as grass is the food of a creature devoid of reason, so has the

<pb n="163"/>

‘sensibly-perceptible’ been assigned to the unreasoning part of the soul. Else why, after saying before “green of the field,” does he go on to say,
“and all grass,” as if it were impossible for green of the field to come up as grass? The fact is, “the green of the field” is the ‘intellectually-perceptible,’ an outgrowth of the mind, but the “grass” is the ‘sensibly-perceptible,’ it in turn being a growth of the unreasoning part of the soul. </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="25"><p> He goes on “for God had not rained upon the earth, and there was no man to work the ground.” These words discover a deep knowledge of the laws of being. For if God does not shower upon the senses the means of apprehending objects presented to them, neither will the mind have anything to “work” or take in hand in the field of sense-perception. </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="26"><p>For the mind by itself is without employment when the Cause of all things does not pour down, like rain and moisture, colours on the sight, sounds on the hearing, savours on the taste, and that which is proper to them on the other senses. But as soon as God has begun to water sense with objects of sense, that moment the mind also is found to be a tiller of rich soil, so to speak. The original of ‘sense-perception’ has no need of nourishment; but the nourishment of ‘sense-perception,’
which he figuratively calls “rain,” is the particular objects of sense, which of course are bodies; whereas an original has nothing to do with bodies. Thus before the creation of particular concrete substances, God did not rain on the original idea of sense-perception, which Moses calls “earth,”
and this means that He supplied it with no food: for indeed it was in absolutely no need whatever of a sensible object of perception. 
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="27"><p> The

<pb n="165"/>

meaning of the words, “and there was not a man to work the ground,” is this: the original idea of the mind did not work the original idea of sense-perception: for my mind like yours works the sense-perception through the objects of the senses, but the original idea of the mind, as there was of course no particular body in existence proper to it, does not work the original idea of ‘sense-perception’: for were it working, it would be working it by means of the objects of sense, but among original ideas there is no such thing as an object of sense.
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="28"><p> <milestone unit="altchapter" n="11"/> “And a spring went up out of the earth and watered all the face of the earth” (Gen. ii. 6). He calls the mind a “spring” of the earth, and the senses its “face,” because Nature, exercising forethought in all things, assigned this place to them out of all the body as most suitable for their special activities: and the mind like a spring waters the senses, sending to each of them the streams suitable to it. See then, how, like links in a chain, the powers of the living creature hold on to each other; for mind and ‘sense-perception’ and object of sense being three, ‘sense-perception’ is in the middle, while mind and object of sense occupy each extreme. </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="29"><p>But neither has the mind power to work, that is, to put forth its energies by way of ‘sense-perception,’ unless God send the object of sense as rain upon it; nor is any benefit derived from the object of sense when so rained down, unless, like a spring, the mind, extending itself to reach the ‘sense-perception,’ stir it out of its repose to grasp the object presented to it. Thus the mind and the object of sense are always practising a reciprocity of giving, the one lying ready for sense-perception as its material, the

<pb n="167"/>

other, like a craftsman, moving sense-perception in the direction of the external object, to produce an impulse towards it. </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="30"><p>For the living creature excels the non-living in two respects, in the power of receiving impressions and in the active impulse
<note n="1.167.a">See App. p. 477.</note>
  towards the object producing them. The impression is produced by the drawing nigh of the external object, as it stamps the mind through sense-perception; while the active impulse, close of kin to the power aforesaid, comes about by way of the mind’s power of self-extension, which it exercises through sense-perception, and so comes into touch with the object presented to it, and goes towards it, striving to reach and seize it.

<milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="12"/> “And God formed the man by taking clay from the earth, and breathed into his face a breath of life, and the man became a living soul” (Gen. ii. 7). There are two types of men; the one a heavenly man, the other an earthly. The heavenly man, being made after the image of God, is altogether without part or lot in corruptible and terrestrial substance; but the earthly one was compacted out of the matter scattered here and there, which Moses calls “clay.” For this reason he says that the heavenly man was not moulded, but was stamped with the image of God; while the earthly is a moulded work of the Artificer, but not His offspring. </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="32"><p>We must account the man made out of the earth to be mind mingling with, but not yet blended with, body. But this earthlike mind is in reality also corruptible, were not God to breathe into it a power of real life; when He does so, it does not any more undergo moulding, but becomes a soul, not an inefficient and imperfectly formed soul, but one

<pb n="169"/>

endowed with mind and actually alive; for he says,
“man became a living soul.”
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="33"><p> 
<milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="13"/>
The question might be asked, why God deemed the earthly and body-loving mind worthy of divine breath at all, but not the mind which had been created after the original, and after His own image; in the second place, what “breathed in” means; thirdly, why the breathing is “into the face”; fourthly, why, though he shows his knowledge of the word ‘spirit’ when he says “and the Spirit of God was borne above the water” (Gen. i. 2), he now says “breath” not “spirit.” </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="34"><p> In answer to the first query, one thing to be said is that God loves to give, and so bestows good things on all, even those who are not perfect, at the same time encouraging them to a zeal for virtue and a participation in it, by displaying His own overflowing wealth, and how there is abundance even for those who will derive no great benefit from it. This characteristic He shows very clearly in other instances also. For when He rains upon the sea, and causes springs to gush forth in the depths of the desert, and waters the poor and rough and barren soil, pouring on it rivers with their overflowings, what else does He prove save the exceeding greatness of His own wealth and goodness? This is the reason for which He created no soul barren of virtue, even if the exercise of it be to some impossible. </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="35"><p> A second thing to be
said is this. It is His will to make compliance with positive ordinances part of duty. One, then, into whom real life had not been breathed, but who was without experience of virtue, when punished for his transgressions would have said that he is unjustly punished, for that it was through inexperience

<pb n="171"/>

of good that he failed in respect of it, and that the blame lay with Him who had failed to breathe into him any conception of it. Nay, he will perhaps say that he does not sin at all, if (as some say) involuntary acts and acts done in ignorance do not count as wrong deeds. 

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="36"><p>
“Breathed into,” we note, is
equivalent to “inspired” or “be-souled” the soulless; for God forbid that we should be infected with such monstrous folly as to think that God employs for inbreathing organs such as mouth or nostrils; for God is not only not in the form of man, but belongs to no class or kind. Yet the expression clearly brings out something that accords with nature. </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="37"><p>For it implies of necessity three things, that which inbreathes, that which receives, that which is inbreathed: that which inbreathes is God, that which receives is the mind, that which is inbreathed is the spirit or breath. What, then, do we infer from these premises? A union of the three comes about, as God projects the power that proceeds from Himself through the mediant breath till it reaches the subject. And for what purpose save that we may obtain a conception of Him? </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="38"><p>For how could the soul have conceived of God, had He not breathed into it and mightily laid hold of it? For the mind of man would never have ventured to soar so high as to grasp the nature of God, had not God Himself drawn it up to Himself, so far as it was possible that the mind of man should be drawn up, and stamped it with the impress of the powers that are within the scope of its understanding. </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="39"><p>
The breathing “into the face” is to be understood both physically and ethically: physically, because it is in the face that He set the senses; for this part of the body is beyond other parts endowed with soul:

<pb n="173"/>

but ethically, on this wise. As the face is the dominant element in the body, so is the mind the dominant element of the soul: into this only does God breathe, whereas He does not see fit to do so with the other parts, whether senses or organs of utterance and of reproduction; for these are secondary in capacity. </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="40"><p>By what, then, were these also inspired? By the mind, evidently. For the mind imparts to the portion of the soul that is devoid of reason a share of that which it has received from God, so that the mind was be-souled by God, but the unreasoning part by the mind. For the mind is, so to speak, God of the unreasoning part. In like manner he does not hesitate to speak of Moses as “a God to Pharaoh”
(Exod. vii. 1).</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="41"><p> For of the things which come into being some come into being both by God’s power and through God’s agency, while others come into being by God’s power but not by His agency. The most excellent things were made both by God and through God. For example, he will presently say, “God planted a pleasaunce” (Gen. ii. 8): to these the mind belongs; but the part devoid of reason was made by God’s power but not by God’s agency, but by that of the reasonable power which rules and holds dominion in the soul. </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="42"><p> He uses the
word ‘breath’ not ‘spirit,’ implying a difference between them; for ‘spirit’ is conceived of as connoting strength and vigour and power, while a ’ breath ’ is like an air or a peaceful and gentle vapour. The mind that was made after the image and original might be said to partake of spirit, for its reasoning faculty possesses robustness; but the mind that was made out of matter must be said to partake of the light and less substantial air, as of some exhalation,

<pb n="175"/>

such as those that rise from spices: for if they are kept and not burned for incense there is still a sweet perfume from them.
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="43"><p> <milestone unit="altchapter" n="14"/> “And God planted a pleasaunce in Eden toward the sun-rising, and placed there the man whom He had formed” (Gen. ii. 8). By using many words for it Moses has already made it manifest that the sublime and heavenly wisdom is of many names; for he calls it “beginning” and “image” and “vision of God”; and now by the planting of the pleasaunce he brings out the fact that earthly wisdom is a copy of this as of an archetype. Far be it from man’s reasoning to be the victim of so great impiety as to suppose that God tills the soil and plants pleasaunces. We should at once be at a loss to tell from what motive He could do so. Not to provide Himself with pleasant refreshment and comfort. Let not such fables even enter our mind. </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="44"><p>For not even the whole world would be a place fit for God to make His abode, since God is His own place, and He is filled by Himself, and sufficient for Himself, filling and containing all other things in their destitution and barrenness and emptiness, but Himself contained by nothing else, seeing that He is Himself One and the Whole.
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="45"><p>  Well then, God sows and plants earthly excellence for the race of mortals as a copy and reproduction of the heavenly. For pitying our race and noting that it is compact of a rich abundance of ills, He caused earthly excellence to strike root, to bring succour and aid to the diseases of the soul. It is, as I said before, a copy of the heavenly and archetypal excellence, to which Moses gives many names. Virtue is figuratively called “pleasaunce,”
and the locality specially suited to the pleasaunce

<pb n="177"/>

“Eden,” which means “luxury”; excellence to be sure has for its fit adjuncts peace and welfare and joy, in which true luxury consists. </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="46"><p>Again the planting of the pleasaunce is “towards the sun-rising,”
for right reason does not set nor is quenched, but its nature is ever to rise, and, I take it, just as the sun when it has risen fills the gloom of the atmosphere with light, so virtue also, when it has risen in the soul, illumines its mist and disperses its deep darkness. </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="47"><p> “And He placed there” it says,
“the man whom He had formed.” For God, being good and training our race to virtue as the operation most proper to it, places the mind amid virtue, evidently to the end that as a good gardener it may spend its care on nothing else but this.
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="48"><p><milestone unit="altchapter" n="15"/> Now the question might be asked, “Why, seeing that to imitate God’s works is a pious act, am I forbidden to plant a grove by the altar, while God plants the pleasaunce?” For it says, “Thou shalt not plant thyself a grove: thou shalt not make to thyself any wood by the side of the altar of the Lord thy God” (Deut. xvi. 21). What then are we to say? That it becomes God to plant and to build virtues in the soul, 
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="49"><p>
but that the mind shows itself to be without God and full of self-love, when it deems itself as on a par with God; and, whereas passivity is its true part, looks on itself as an agent. When God sows and plants noble qualities in the soul, the mind that says “I plant” is guilty of impiety. Thou shalt not plant, therefore, whensoever God is tending His plants. But if thou <hi rend="italic">dost</hi> set plants in the soul, O mind, set only fruit-bearing plants. Set not a grove, for in a grove there are both wild and cultivated trees. And to plant in the soul barren wickedness

<pb n="179"/>

by the side of cultivated and fruit-yielding virtue is like leprosy with its twofold growths and blending of discordant hues. </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="50"><p>If, however, thou <hi rend="italic">dost</hi> bring into the same place things heterogeneous and incapable of mixture, let them be separate and distinct from the pure and unsullied growth that offers up fruits free from blemish to God. And it is such a growth that is meant by the altar of sacrifice: for it is a violation of this to say that anything is the (independent) work of the soul, since there is nothing there that has not reference
<note n="1.179.a">Philo plays on the two senses of ἀναφέρειν, “offer” and “refer”</note>
  to God. To say that is to mingle the barren with the fruit-bearing. And this is a blemish, whereas only things without blemish are offered to God. </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="51"><p>If then thou transgress in any of these respects, O soul, thou wilt injure thyself, not God; that is why it says “thou shalt not plant <hi rend="italic">to thyself</hi>”; for to God no one does such tillage, above all when the plants are bad ones; and it goes on to say,” thou shalt not make <hi rend="italic">to thyself</hi>.” It says also in another case, “Ye shall not make together with Me gods of silver, and gods of gold ye shall not make to yourselves” (Exod. xx. 23). For he that thinks either that God belongs to a type, or that He is not one, or that He is not unoriginate and incorruptible, or that He is not incapable of change, wrongs himself not God; for it says, “to yourselves ye shall not make”; for we must deem that He belongs to no type, and that He is One and incorruptible and unchangeable. He that does not so conceive infects his own soul with a false and godless opinion. </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="52"><p>Do you not see that, even if He bring us into virtue and even if, when brought in, we plant no fruitless thing but “every tree good for food,” He yet commands us “thoroughly to cleanse its uncleanness”

<pb n="181"/>

(Lev. xix. 23)? And this means the notion that we are planting, for it is the cutting away of self-conceit that He demands, and self-conceit is in its nature unclean.
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="53"><p><milestone unit="altchapter" n="16"/> Speaking here of the man
whom God moulded, it merely says that He “placed him in the garden.” Who then is it of whom it says later on “The Lord God took the man whom He had made, and placed him in the garden to till it and to guard it” (Gen. ii. 15)? It would seem then that this is a different man, the one that was made after the image and archetype, so that two men are introduced into the garden, the one a moulded being, the other “after the image.”</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="54"><p> The one then that was made according to the original has his sphere not only in the planting of virtues but is also their tiller and guardian, and that means that he is mindful of all that he heard and practised in his training; but the
“moulded” man neither tills the virtues nor guards them, but is only introduced to the truths by the rich bounty of God, presently to be an exile from virtue. </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="55"><p>For this reason in describing the man whom God only places in the garden, Moses uses the word
“moulded,” but of the man whom He appoints both tiller and guardian he speaks not as “moulded,” but he says “whom He had made”; and the one He receives, and the other He casts out. And He confers on him whom He receives three gifts, which constitute natural ability, facility in apprehending, persistence in doing, tenacity in keeping. Facility in apprehending is the placing in the garden, persistence in doing is the practice of noble deeds, tenacity in keeping the guarding and retaining in the memory of the holy precepts. But the
“moulded” mind neither keeps in mind nor

<pb n="183"/>

carries out in action the things that are noble, but has facility in apprehending them and no more than this. Accordingly after being placed in the garden he soon runs away and is cast out.

Moses now indicates what trees of virtue God plants in the soul. These are the several particular virtues, and the corresponding activities, and the complete moral victories, and what philosophers call καθήκοντα or common duties.

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="57"><p>
  These are the plants of the garden. These very plants he characterizes, showing that what is good is also most fair to be seen and enjoyed. For some of the arts and sciences are theoretical indeed but not practical,
<note n="1.183.b">See App. p. 477.</note>
  such as geometry and astronomy, and some are practical, but not theoretical, as the arts of the carpenter and coppersmith, and all that are called mechanical; but virtue is both theoretical and practical; for clearly it involves theory, since philosophy, the road that leads to it, involves it through its three parts,
<note n="1.183.b">See App. p. 477.</note>
  logic, ethics, physics; and it involves conduct, for virtue is the art of the whole of life, and life includes all kinds of conduct. </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="58"><p>But while virtue involves theory and practice, it is furthermore of surpassing excellence in each respect; for indeed the theory of virtue is perfect in beauty, and the practice and exercise of it a prize to be striven for.

words which point to its excellence in exercise and practice.
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="59"><p><milestone unit="altchapter" n="18"/> Now the tree of life is
virtue in the most comprehensive sense, which some term goodness. From it the particular virtues derive their existence. That is why it is also set in the midst of the garden, occupying the central all-embracing
position, that it may, like a king, be attended by those on either side as by body-guards. But some say that it is the heart that is called the tree of life, since it is the cause of life and has been allotted the central place in the body, as it naturally would, being in their view the dominating principle.
<note n="1.185.a">See Vol. II. App. p. 492, note on <hi rend="italic">De Sac.</hi> 136.</note>
  But these people should remember that they are setting forth a view worthy of the physician rather than of the philosopher, while we, as we have said, maintain that virtue in its most generic aspect is called the tree of life. </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="60"><p>Of this he expressly says that it is in the midst of the garden, but as to the other tree, that of knowing good and evil, he has not made it clear whether it is within or without the garden, but immediately after the words, “and the tree of the knowledge of good and evil,” he comes to a stop without making it clear where it was. His silence is due to his desire to prevent the man unversed in natural philosophy from regarding with wonder the spot where that knowledge dwells.
<note n="1.185.b">Philo apparently means that Moses refrained from mentioning where the Tree of Knowledge of good and evil was situated, lest its locality should become an object of awe and wonder to the ignorant. φυσιολογία is the <hi rend="italic">naturae species</hi> <hi rend="italic">ratioque</hi> of Lucretius (i. 147, ii. 58, iii. 91, vi. 38) which <hi rend="italic">terrorem animi tenebrasque necesse est Discutiat</hi>.

  What then must we say? That this tree is both in the garden and outside it, in literal fact in it, virtually outside it. How so? Our dominant part is all-receptive and


<pb n="187"/>

resembles wax that receives all impresssions fair and ugly; accordingly the supplanter Jacob makes acknowledgement saying, “Upon me came all these things” (Gen. xlii. 36); for upon the soul, one as it is, the countless impressions of all things in the universe are borne. Whenever, then, it shall have received the stamp of perfect virtue, it straightway becomes the tree of life, but when it receives that of wickedness, it straightway becomes the tree of knowledge of good and evil. But wickedness has been exiled from the divine choir.
<note n="1.187.a">Plato, <hi rend="italic">Phaedrus</hi> 247 A.</note>
  The ruling part in us therefore that has received it is actually in the garden, for it has in it likewise the stamp of virtue, properly belonging to the garden; but on the other hand it is virtually not in it, because the impress of wickedness is alien to a place of divine sunrising. </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="62"><p>You may grasp what I mean in this way. At this moment my ruling part is in literal fact in my body, but virtually in Italy or Sicily, when it is pondering on these countries, and in heaven, when it is considering heaven. Accordingly it often happens that people who are actually in unconsecrated spots are really in most sacred ones, when they are forming images of all that pertains to virtue. Others, on the other hand, who are in consecrated spots are in mind profane, owing to their mind admitting bad impressions and inclinations to what is unworthy. Thus wickedness neither <hi rend="italic">is</hi> in the garden, nor is it <hi rend="italic">not</hi> in it, for it can be there actually, but virtually it cannot.

And the third river is Tigris; this is that whose course is in front of Assyria. And the fourth river is Euphrates” (Gen. ii. 10–14). By these rivers his purpose is to indicate the particular virtues. These are four in number,
<note n="1.189.a">The four cardinal virtues belong, of course, to Platonism, though adopted by later philosophers.</note>
  prudence, self-mastery,
courage, justice. The largest river, of which the four are effluxes, is generic virtue, which we have called “goodness.” The four effluxes are the virtues of the same number. </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="64"><p>Generic virtue takes its start from Eden, the wisdom of God, which is full of joy, and brightness, and exultation, glorying and priding itself only upon God its Father; but the specific virtues, four in number, are derived from generic virtue, which like a river waters the perfect achievements of each of them with an abundant flow of noble doings. </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="65"><p> Let us look too at
the particular words used. “A river,” it says “issues forth from Eden to water the garden.” “River” is generic virtue, goodness. This issues forth out of Eden, the wisdom of God, and this is the Reason of God; for after that has generic virtue been made. And generic virtue waters the garden, that is, it waters the particular virtues. “Heads” he takes not in the sense of locality but of sovereignty. For each of the virtues is in very deed a sovereign and a queen. “Is separated” is equivalent to ‘has boundaries to define it.’ Prudence, concerned with things to be done, sets boundaries round them; courage round things to be endured; self-mastery


<pb n="191"/>

round things to be chosen; justice round things to be awarded.

This is that which encompasseth all the land of Evilat, there where the gold is; and the gold of that land is good; and there is the ruby and the emerald.” One species of the four virtues is prudence, which he has called “Pheison,” owing to its ‘sparing’
<note n="1.191.a">φείδεσθαι =“to spare.”</note>
  and guarding the soul from deeds of wrong. And it encircles in its roundel the land of Evilat; that is to say, it cherishes with care the kindly and gentle and gracious disposition; and, as of all smelted substance the most excellent and most approved is gold, so of the soul too the most approved virtue is prudence. </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="67"><p>And the words, “there where (or ‘whose’) the gold is” are not a mere piece of local information, there where the gold is, but there (is He) whose is the treasure, even prudence gleaming like gold, tried by the fire, and precious; and prudence is acknowledged to be God’s fairest treasure. And in the place where prudence dwells are two corresponding concretes, the man who is prudent, and the man who exercises prudence. These he likens to ruby and emerald.</p></div>

<milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="22"/> It is worth inquiring why courage is mentioned in the second place, self-mastery in the third, and prudence in the first, and why he has not set forth a different order of the virtues. We must observe, then, that our soul is threefold,
<note n="1.193.a">See App. p. 478.</note>
  and has one part that is the seat of reason, another that is the seat of high spirit, and another that is the seat of desire. And we discover that the head is the place and abode of the reasonable part, the breast of the passionate part, the abdomen of the lustful part; and that to each of the parts a virtue proper to it has been attached; prudence to the reasonable part, for it belongs to reason to have knowledge of the things we ought to do and of the things we ought not; courage to the passionate part; and self-mastery to the lustful part.

spirit, the second part of the soul, and in the breast, the corresponding part of the body; and third self-mastery, for its sphere of action is the abdomen, which is of course the third part of the body, and the lustful faculty, to which has been assigned the third place in the soul.

“Euphrates” means ‘fruitfulness,’ and is a figurative name for the fourth virtue, justice, a virtue fruitful indeed and bringing gladness to the mind. When, then, does it appear? When the three parts of the soul are in harmony. Harmony for them is the dominance of the more excellent; for instance, when the two, the high-spirited and the lustful, are guided by the reasoning faculty as horses by their driver, then justice emerges; for it is justice for the better to rule always and everywhere, and for the worse to be ruled: and the reasoning faculty is better, the lustful and the high-spirited the inferior. </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="74"><p> <milestone unit="altchapter" n="24"/> Now let us go on to look at our subject in this way. “Pheison” signifies ‘alteration of mouth,’ and “Evilat” ‘in travail’: and by these prudence is plainly indicated. For while most people deem the man prudent who can find sophistical arguments, and is clever at expressing his ideas, Moses knows such

<pb n="197"/>

an one to be a lover of words indeed, but a prudent man by no means. For prudence is discerned in
“alteration of the mouth,”
<note n="1.197.a">i.e., transference of the matter from the sphere of theory to that of practice.</note>
  that is in the word of utterance undergoing a transformation. This comes to the same thing as saying that prudence is not seen in speech but in action and earnest doings. </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="75"><p>And prudence surrounds with an encircling wall Evilat, or “folly in travail,” to besiege and overthrow it. “Travailing” is a name strictly appropriate to folly, because the foolish mind, being enamoured of things out of its reach, is evermore in travail pangs. This is so when it is enamoured of money, when of glory, when of pleasure, when of anything else. </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="76"><p>But, though in travail, it never brings to the birth, for the soul of the worthless man has not by nature the power to bring forth any offspring. What it seems to produce turn out to be wretched abortions and miscarriages, devouring half of its flesh, an evil tantamount to the death of the soul. Accordingly Aaron, the sacred word, begs of Moses, the beloved of God, to heal the change in Miriam, that her soul may not be in travail with evils; and so he says
“Let her not become as one dead, as an abortion coming forth from the womb of a mother; consuming half of her flesh” (Num. xii. 12).
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="77"><p> <milestone unit="altchapter" n="25"/> To resume. “There,” it says, “where (or
‘whose’) the gold is” (Gen. ii. 11). It does not merely say that the gold is there, but “there (is He)
‘whose’ it is.” For prudence, which he has likened to gold, a substance free from alloy and pure and cleansed by fire and tested and precious, is there in the wisdom of God, but, being there, is not a possession of wisdom, but of Him whose is wisdom itself also, even God Who created it and makes it His.

<pb n="199"/>

“Now the gold of that land is good.” </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="78"><p>“Is there, then, other gold that is not good?” Yes, indeed, for prudence is of two kinds, the one universal, the other particular. The prudence that is in me, being particular, is not good, for when I perish, it perishes together with me. But the universal prudence, which has for its abode the wisdom of God and His dwelling-place, is good, for, itself imperishable, it abides in an imperishable dwelling-place.

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="79"><p><milestone unit="altchapter" n="26"/> “And there is the ruby and the greenstone (<hi rend="italic">ibid</hi>.), the two concrete embodiments of this virtue, the man who has good sense, and the man who exercises good sense: the determining quality in the one is potential good sense, that in the other good sense exercised. For it was for the sake of these concretes that God sowed in the earth-born
man good sense (in particular) and virtue (in general). For what benefit had there been in virtue had there not been ready for it the activities of reason to welcome it and receive its impressions?”
So that, naturally, there where good sense is, there is both the man who has good sense, and the man who exercises good sense, the two precious stones.

  Because Judah, the disposition prone to make confession of praise, is exempt from body and matter. For indeed the very word denoting confession (of praise) vividly portrays the acknowledgement that takes a man out of himself. For whenever the mind goes out from itself and offers itself up to God, as Isaac or “laughter,” does, then does it make confession of acknowledgement towards the Existent One. But so long as the mind supposes itself to be the author of anything, it is far away from making room for God and from confessing or making acknowledgement to Him. For we must take note that the very confession of praise itself is the work not of the soul but of God who gives it thankfulness.

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="89"><p>This pure mind, then, God takes, not suffering it to go outside of Himself, and, having taken it, sets it among the virtues that have roots and put forth shoots, that he may till them and guard them.

We must raise the question <hi rend="italic">what</hi> Adam He commands and who this is; for the writer has not mentioned him before, but has named him now for the first time. Perchance, then, he means to give us the name of the man that was moulded. “Call him earth” he says, for that is the meaning of
“Adam,” so that when you hear the word “Adam,”
you must make up your mind that it is the earthly and perishable mind; for the mind that was made after the image is not earthly but heavenly. </p></div>

Can it say what it is and of what kind, breath or blood or fire or air or anything else? Can it even say that it is a body or else that it is incorporeal? Are not they simpletons, then, who inquire about God’s substance? For how should those, who know not the substance of their own soul, have accurate ideas about the soul of the universe? For

Now it is to this being, and not to the being created after His image and after the original idea, that God gives the command. For the latter, even without urging, possesses virtue instinctively; but the former, independently of instruction, could have no part in wisdom. </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="93"><p> There is a difference between these three—injunction, prohibition, command accompanied by exhortation. For prohibition deals with wrongdoings and is addressed to the bad man, injunction concerns duties rightly done, and exhortation is addressed to the neutral man, the man who is neither bad nor good: for he is neither sinning, to lead anyone to forbid him, nor is he so doing right as right reason enjoins, but has need of exhortation, which teaches him to refrain from evil things, and incites him to aim at things noble. </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="94"><p>There is no need, then, to give injunctions or prohibitions or exhortations to the perfect man formed after the (Divine) image, for none of these does the perfect man require. The bad man has need of injunction and prohibition, and the child of exhortation and teaching. Just so the perfect master of music or letters requires none of the directions that apply to those arts, whereas the man who stumbles over the subjects of his study does require what we may call laws or rules with their injunctions and prohibitions, while one who is now beginning to learn requires teaching.

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="95"><p> Quite naturally, then, does God give the commandments and exhortations before us to the earthly man who is neither bad nor good but midway between these. To enforce the exhortation, both Divine titles are employed, both “Lord” and
“God,” for it says “God the Lord commanded him.” This is in order that, should he obey the exhortations, he may be deemed worthy by God of His benefactions; but that, should he rebel, he may be driven from the presence of the Lord who has a Master’s authority over him.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="96"><p> For this reason again, when he is being cast out of the garden, the sacred writer has introduced the same titles, for he says,
“And the Lord God sent him forth out of the garden of delight, to till the ground, out of which he was taken” (Gen. iii. 23). This is to show that, since “the Lord” as Master and “God” as Benefactor had issued the commands, so in both capacities does He inflict punishment on him who had disobeyed them. For he dismisses the disobedient by the exercise of the very powers which He had exercised in urging him to obedience.

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="97"><p> <milestone unit="altchapter" n="31"/> The charge which he gives is this: “From every tree that is in the garden thou shalt eat feedingly thereon” (Gen. ii. 16). He moves the soul of the man to get benefit, not from a single tree or from a single virtue but from all the virtues: for eating is a figure of soul-nourishment: and the soul is nourished by the acquisition of things noble, and the practice of things rightful. </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="98"><p>And He says not merely “shalt eat,” but also “feedingly,” that is, chewing and masticating the nourishment, not like an ordinary person, but like an athlete, that you may

For the athlete and I take nourishment with different objects; I, just to sustain life, the athlete, for the further purpose of growing brawny and strong; and so mastication of food is a special point in training. Such is the meaning of “thou shalt eat feedingly thereon.” </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="99"><p> Let
us try to form a yet more precise conception of it. To honour our parents is something eatable and nutritious: but good and bad sons honour them differently, the latter in compliance with custom, and these do not “eat feedingly,” but simply eat. When, then, eat they feedingly too? When, after exploring the precept and searching for the grounds on which it rests, they freely determine that such conduct is noble. The grounds for it are such as these: they gave us birth, nurtured us, educated us, have been authors of all good things to us. Honour again shown to the Existent One is something eatable; it is shown “feedingly,” when the honour we show is coupled with close search into the precept, and with a due appreciation of its motives.

Therefore this tree is not in the garden: for if He bids them to eat of every tree in the garden, but not to eat of this one, it is evident that it is not in the garden: and this is quite naturally so: for actually, as I have said, it is there, and virtually it is not. For as all the impressions are virtually in the wax, but actually only the one that has been made, so in the


<pb n="215"/>

soul, whose nature is waxlike, all the types are contained virtually, but not in actual execution, and the single one engraved in it is in possession, so long as it has not been obliterated by another seal which has made over it a clearer and bolder impression.  Next there is this further question to be raised. </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="101"><p>When He is giving the charge to eat of every tree of the garden, He addresses the command to a single person, but when He issues the prohibition against making any use of that which causes evil and good, He speaks to more than one: for in the former case He says, “Thou shalt eat from every tree”; but in the latter, “ye shall not eat, and in the day that ye eat” not “that thou eatest,” and “ye shall die” not “thou shalt die.” </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="102"><p>We must accordingly remark in the first place that the good is scarce, the evil abundant. Hence it is hard to find a single wise man, while of inferior men there is a countless multitude.

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="103"><p>In the second place, for the acquisition and practice of virtue a single thing only, namely our understanding, is requisite: but the body not only fails to co-operate to this end, but is an actual hindrance; for we may almost make it an axiom that the business of wisdom is to become estranged from the body and its cravings
<note n="1.215.a">Plato, <hi rend="italic">Phaedo</hi> 65 A.</note>
 : but for the enjoyment of evil it is necessary not only that the mind be in a certain condition, but also the power of perception and of speech, in fact the body; </p></div>

unless he have an organ of speech? And how is he to indulge in pleasures, if he be bereft of a stomach and the organs of taste? So it is in accordance with the necessities of the case that He addresses the understanding alone about gaining virtue; for, as I said, it alone is needed for its acquisition; whereas in the pursuit of evil several faculties are needed, soul, speech, senses, body, for wickedness employs all these in displaying itself.
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="105"><p> <milestone unit="altchapter" n="33"/> And further he says, “In the day that ye eat thereof, ye shall die the death” (Gen. ii. 17). And yet after they have eaten, not merely do they not die, but they beget children and become authors of life to others. What, then, is to be said to this? That death is of two kinds, one that of the man in general, the other that of the soul in particular. The death of the man is the separation of the soul from the body,
<note n="1.217.a">Plato, <hi rend="italic">Phaedo</hi> 64 C.</note>
  but the death of the soul is the decay of virtue and the bringing in of wickedness. </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="106"><p>It is for this reason that God says not only “die” but “die the death,” indicating not the death common to us all, but that special death properly so called, which is that of the soul becoming entombed in passions and wickedness of all kinds. And this death is practically the antithesis of the death which awaits us all. The latter is a separation of combatants that had been pitted against one another,
<note n="1.217.b">Or “of elements which had been in combination.”</note>
  body and soul, to wit. The former, on the other hand, is a meeting of the two in conflict. And in this conflict the worse, the body, overcomes, and the better, the soul, is overcome. </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="108"><p>That is an excellent saying of Heracleitus,
who on this point followed Moses’ teaching, “We live,” he says, “their death, and are dead to their life.” He means that now, when we are living, the soul is dead and has been entombed in the body as in a sepulchre; whereas, should we die, the soul lives forthwith its own proper life, and is released from the body, the baneful corpse to which it was tied.

<milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="1"/> “And the Lord God said, It is not good that the man should be alone, let us make for him a helper corresponding to him” (Gen. ii. 18). Why, O prophet, is it not good that the man should be alone? </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="2"><p>Because, he says, it is good that the Alone should be alone: but God, being One, is alone and unique, and like God there is nothing. Hence, since it is good that He Who is should be alone—for indeed with regard to Him alone can the statement “it is good” be made—it follows that it would not be good that the man should be alone. There is another way in which we may understand the statement that God is alone. It may mean that neither before creation was there anything with God, nor, when the universe had come into being, does anything take its place with Him; for there is absolutely nothing which He needs. A yet better interpretation is the following. God is alone, a Unity, in the sense that His nature is simple not composite, whereas each one of us and of all other created beings is made up of many things. I, for example, am many things in one. I am soul and body. To soul belong rational and irrational parts, and to body, again, different properties, warm and cold, heavy and light, dry and moist. But God is not a composite Being, consisting of many parts,

<pb n="227"/>

nor is He mixed with aught else. </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="3"><p>For whatever is added to God, is either superior or inferior or equal to Him. But there is nothing equal or superior to God. And no lesser thing is resolved into Him. If He do so assimilate any lesser thing, He also will be lessened. And if He can be made less, He will also be capable of corruption; and even to imagine this were blasphemous. The “one” and the “monad” are, therefore, the only standard for determining the category to which God belongs. Rather should we say, the One God is the sole standard for the “monad.” For, like time, all number is subsequent to the universe; and God is prior to the universe, and is its Maker.
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="4"><p><milestone unit="altchapter" n="2"/> It is not good that <hi rend="italic">any</hi> man should be alone. For there are <hi rend="italic">two</hi> races of men, the one made after the (Divine) Image, and the one moulded out of the earth. For the man made after the Image it is not good to be alone, because he yearns after the Image. For the image of God is a pattern of which copies are made, and every copy longs for that of which it is a copy, and its station is at its side. Far less is it good for the man moulded of the earth to be alone. Nay, it is impossible. For with the mind so formed, linked to it in closest fellowship, are senses, passions, vices, ten thousand other presences. </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="5"><p>With the second man a helper is associated. To begin with, the helper is a created one, for it says, “Let us <hi rend="italic">make</hi> a helper for him”; and, in the next place, is subsequent to him who is to be helped, for He had formed the mind before and is about to form its helper. In these particulars again, while using terms of outward nature he is conveying a deeper meaning. For sense and the passions are helpers

<pb n="229"/>

of the soul and come after the soul. In what way they help we shall see: let us fix our attention on their coming later than the soul.
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="6"><p><milestone unit="altchapter" n="3"/> In the view of the best physicians and natural philosophers the heart is thought to be formed before the whole body, by way of a foundation, or as the keel in a ship, the rest of the body being built upon it; and they assert that accordingly even after death it still beats, and decays after the body, as it came into existence before it. In just the same way, it is thought, the princely part of the soul is older than the soul as a whole, and the irrational portion younger. The creation of this the prophet has not as yet related, but he is going to describe it. The irrational portion is sense and the passions which are the offspring of sense, unquestionably so if they are not the result of any choice of our own.
<note n="1.229.a">See App. p. 479.</note>
  This helper then is later born and of course created.
<milestone unit="para"/>Now let us consider the point which we deferred, <hi rend="italic">how</hi> the help is given.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="7"><p> How does our mind apprehend the fact that an object is white or black, except by using sight as a helper? How does it become aware that the musician’s voice is sweet or on the other hand out of tune, save by using the sense of hearing as a helper? How does it recognize that perfumes are pleasant or disagreeable, except by using as an ally the sense of smell? How does it distinguish savours, except by means of the taste acting as its helper? </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="8"><p>Things smooth and rough, again, how but by touch? Moreover, there are, as I have said, helpers of another kind, namely the passions. For pleasure and desire contribute to the permanence of our kind: pain and fear are like bites or stings warning the soul to treat nothing carelessly: anger

<pb n="231"/>

is a weapon of defence, which has conferred great boons on many: and so with the other passions. This shows also that the prophet was perfectly right in saying that the helper must be one “corresponding to him.” For in very deed this helper is intimately allied to the mind, as though a brother of one blood with it: for sense-perception and passions are parts and offspring of one soul with it.
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="9"><p><milestone unit="altchapter" n="4"/> There are two species of this helper: the one has its sphere in the passions, the other in sense-perception. At present He will produce the former only, for he says, “And God moulded moreover out of the earth all the wild beasts of the field, and all the birds of the heaven, and led them to Adam, to see what he would call them: and whatever Adam called a living soul, this was its
<note n="1.231.a">Or “his.” See 18. αὐτοῦ can be masculine or neuter.</note>
  name” (Gen. ii. 19). You see who are our helpers, the wild beasts, the soul’s passions: for after saying, “Let us make a helper corresponding to him,” he adds the words, “He moulded the wild beasts,” implying that the wild beasts are our helpers. </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="10"><p>These are not properly called our helpers, but by a straining of language; in reality they are found to be our actual foes, just as the allies of states sometimes turn out to be traitors and deserters, and in private friendships flatterers prove enemies instead of comrades. He uses the terms “heaven” and “field” as synonyms, meaning the mind. For the mind is like the field in having countless sproutings and upgrowths, and like heaven again in having natures brilliant and godlike and blessed. </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="11"><p>The passions he likens to wild beasts and birds, because, savage and untamed as they are, they tear the soul to pieces, and because like winged things they light upon the understanding;

<pb n="233"/>

for the assault of the passions is violent and irresistible. The addition of “further” to “formed” is by no means otiose. How do we see this? Because above also he mentions the forming of the wild beasts before the creation of man, as we see from these words referring to the sixth day: and He said, “Let the earth bring forth the living soul after its kind, four-footed animals and creeping things and wild beasts” (Gen. i. 24). </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="12"><p> How comes
He, then, to form other wild beasts now, and not to be satisfied with those former ones? From the ethical point of view what we must say is this. In the realm of created things the class or kind of wickedness is abundant. It follows that in this the worst things are ever being produced. From the philosophical point of view our answer must be, that on the former occasion, when engaged in the Work of the six days, He wrought the genera or kinds and the originals of the passions, whereas now He is fashioning the species as well. This is why he says, “He fashioned moreover.” </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="13"><p>That what were created in the first instance were genera, is evident from the words employed, “Let the earth bring forth the living soul,” not according to species but “according to kind.” And we find Him in every instance working in this way. Before the species He completes the genera. He does so in the case of man. Having first fashioned man as a genus, in which the prophet says that there is the male and the female genus, He afterwards makes Adam, the finished form or species.
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="14"><p> <milestone unit="altchapter" n="5"/> Helpers of this sort the prophet has now dealt with; the other sort he defers, that of sense-perception, I mean, until the Creator takes in hand to

fashion woman. Having deferred that subject, he goes on to a systematic treatment of the giving of names. Here his literal statement and his symbolic interpretation alike claim our admiration. What we admire in the Lawgiver’s literal statement is his ascription to the first man of the fixing of names. </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="15"><p>Indeed Greek philosophers
<note n="1.235.a">See App. p. 479.</note>
  said that those who first assigned names to things were wise men. Moses did better than they, first of all in ascribing it not to some of the men of old but to the first man created. His purpose was that, as Adam was formed to be the beginning from which all others drew their birth, so too no other than he should be regarded as the beginning of the use of speech: for even language would not have existed, if there had not been names. Again, had many persons bestowed names on things, they would inevitably have been incongruous and ill-matched, different persons imposing them on different principles, whereas the naming by one man was bound to bring about harmony between name and thing, and the name given was sure to be a symbol, the same for all men, of any object to which the name was attached or of the meaning attaching to the name.
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="16"><p> <milestone unit="altchapter" n="6"/> What he says in the domain of ethics is to this effect. We often use “τί” (=“what”) for “διὰ τί”
<note n="1.235.a">See App. p. 479.</note>
  (“by reason of what”), as “what (i.e. why) have you bathed?” “What (i.e. ‘why’) are you walking?” “What (i.e. ‘why’) are you conversing?” In all these cases “what” stands for “because of what.” When the prophet says “to see <hi rend="italic">what</hi> he would call them” you should understand something equivalent to ‘why the mind would call and invite to it and greet’ each of these objects, whether only for the

<pb n="237"/>

sake of that which it cannot dispense with, seeing that all that is mortal is necessarily bound up with passions and vices, or also for the sake of what is in excess of reasonable needs; and whether to satisfy the needs of flesh and blood, or because it deems them good and admirable above all things. </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="17"><p>For example. A created being cannot but make use of pleasure. But the worthless man will use it as a perfect good, but the man of worth simply as a necessity, remembering that apart from pleasure nothing in mortal kind comes into existence. Again the worthless man accounts the acquisition of wealth a most perfect good; the man of worth regards it as just necessary and serviceable and no more. No wonder then that God wishes to see and ascertain how the mind invites and welcomes each of these, whether as good, or as indifferent, or as bad but at all events as serviceable. </p></div>

  For example, if he welcomed pleasure, he was called pleasure-loving; if desire, desire-ridden; if licence, licentious; if cowardice, cowardly; and so on. For, just as the man whose quality is determined by the virtues is from them called wise or sober-minded or just or brave, so from the vices is he called unjust and foolish and unmanly, whensoever he has invited to himself and given a hearty welcome to the corresponding dispositions.

<pb n="239"/>

their literal sense are of the nature of a myth. For how could anyone admit that a woman, or a human being at all, came into existence out of a man’s side? And what was there to hinder the First Cause from creating woman, as He created man, out of the earth? For not only was the Maker the same Being, but the material too, out of which every particular kind was fashioned, was practically unlimited. And why, when there were so many parts to choose from, did He form the woman not from some other part but from the side? And which side did he take? For we may assume that only two are indicated, as there is in fact nothing to suggest a large number of them. Did he take the left or the right side? </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="20"><p>If He filled up with flesh (the place of) the one which He took, are we to suppose that the one which He left was <hi rend="italic">not</hi> made of flesh?

  Truly our sides are twin in all their parts and are made of flesh. What then are we to say? </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="21"><p>“Sides” is a term of ordinary life for “strength.” To say that a man has “sides” is equivalent to saying that he is strong, we say of a powerful athlete “he has stout sides,” and to say that a singer has “sides” is as much as to say that he has great lung power in singing. </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="22"><p>Having said this, we must go on to remark that the mind when as yet unclothed and unconfined by the body (and it is of the mind when not so confined that he is speaking) has many powers. It has the power of holding together,
<note n="1.239.b">See App. p. 480.</note>
  of growing, of conscious life, of thought, and countless other powers, varying both in species and genus. Lifeless things, like stones and blocks of wood, share with all others the power of holding together, of which the bones in us, which are not unlike stones,

<pb n="241"/>

partake. “Growth” extends to plants, and there are parts in us, such as our nails and hair, resembling plants; “growth” is coherence capable of moving itself. </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="23"><p>Conscious life is the power to grow, with the additional power of receiving impressions and being the subject of impulses. This is shared also by creatures without reason. Indeed our mind contains a part that is analogous to the conscious life of a creature without reason. Once more, the power of thinking is peculiar to the mind, and while shared, it may well be, by beings more akin to God, is, so far as mortal beings are concerned, peculiar to man. This power or faculty is twofold. We are rational beings, on the one hand as being partakers of mind, and on the other as being capable of discourse. </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="24"><p>Well, there is also another power or faculty in the soul, closely akin to these, namely that of receiving sense-impressions, and it is of this that the prophet is speaking. For his immediate concern is just this, to indicate the origin of active sense-perception. And logical sequence leads him to do so.
<milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="8"/> For it was requisite that the creation of mind should be followed immediately by that of sense-perception, to be a helper and ally to it. Having then finished the creation of the mind He fashions the product of creative skill that comes next to it alike in order and in power, namely active sense-perception, with a view to the completeness of the whole soul, and with a view to its apprehension of objects presented to it. </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="25"><p>How is it, then, produced? As the prophet himself again says, it is when the mind has fallen asleep. As a matter of fact it is when the mind has gone to sleep that perception begins, for conversely when the mind wakes up perception is quenched.

<pb n="243"/>

A proof of this is afforded by the fact that whenever we wish to get an accurate understanding of a subject we hurry off to a lonely spot; we close our eyes; we stop our ears; we say “good-bye” to our perceptive faculties. So then, we see that, when the mind is astir and awake, the power of perception is suppressed.
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="26"><p>There is the other point to be noticed. Let us see what happens to the mind in sleep. When the perceptive faculty has been set astir and aflame, owing to the eye contemplating the masterpieces of painters or sculptors, does not the mind remain inactive, and cease to exercise itself on objects of thought? And when the ear is intent on the tunefulness of a voice, can the mind be employing its reasoning power upon any of the subjects belonging to its sphere? Of course not. And in good sooth the mind finds itself still more completely out of work when the sense of taste has fully roused itself and is gorging itself with all that delights the appetite.
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="27"><p> And this is the reason why Moses, fearing lest the mind should not only go to sleep but absolutely die, says in another place, “And thou shalt have a shovel upon thy belt; and it shall be, when thou sittest down abroad, thou shalt dig therewith and cover over thine unseemliness” (Deut. xxiii. 13). He uses the term “shovel” figuratively for the reason that digs out hidden matters. </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="28"><p>And he bids the man wear it upon his passion, which must be girded up and which he must not allow to be loose and slack. And this girding must be put into practice whenever the mind, relaxing from the strain of its own objects, lowers itself to the passions, and “sits down abroad,” giving itself up to be drawn

<pb n="245"/>

by bodily necessity. </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="29"><p>And this is how the matter stands. Whenever the mind forgets itself amid the luxuries of a festive gathering and is mastered by all that conduces to pleasure, we are in bondage and we leave our “unseemliness” uncovered. But if the reason prove strong enough to purge the passion, we neither go on drinking till we are drunk, nor eat so greedily as to wax wanton, but we banish folly and take our food soberly. </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="30"><p>Thus the wakefulness of the senses means sleep for the mind, and the wakefulness of the mind a time of leisure for the senses; just as, when the sun has risen, the lights of the other heavenly bodies are invisible; when it has set, they show themselves. The mind, like the sun, when awake, throws the senses into the shade, but if it goes to sleep, it causes them to shine out.
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="31"><p><milestone unit="altchapter" n="9"/> Having said this, we must show how the terms employed accord with it. “God cast,” he says, “a trance upon Adam, and he went to sleep” (Gen. ii. 21). Quite correctly does he use this language. For the mind’s trance and change is its sleep, and it falls into a trance when it ceases to be engaged with the objects appropriate to it; and when it is not at work at these, it is sleeping. Rightly also does he say that this change or turning which he undergoes is not of his own motion but of God’s; that it is God who “casts it on him,” that is, brings and sends it on him. For the case is this. </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="32"><p>For if the change were in our hands I should have recourse to it, when I wished, and when it was not my deliberate choice I should then continue unturned. But as it is, the change is actually repugnant to me, and many a time when wishing to entertain some fitting thought, I am

drenched by a flood of unfitting matters pouring over me; and conversely when on the point of admitting a conception of something vile, I have washed the vile thing away with wholesome thoughts,

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="33"><p>Now every created thing must necessarily undergo change, for this is its property, even as unchangeableness is the property of God.

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="34"><p>This is why Moses says, “He will not permit the destroyer to come into your houses to smite you” (Exod. xii. 23): for He does indeed permit the destroyer—(“destruction” being the change or turning of the soul)—to enter into the soul, that He may make it evident that what is peculiar to created things is there; but God will not let the offspring of “the seeing” Israel be in such wise changed as to receive his death-blow by the change, but will force him to rise and emerge as though from deep water and recover.
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="35"><p><milestone unit="altchapter" n="10"/> “He took one of his sides” (Gen. ii. 21). Of the many faculties of the mind He took one, the faculty of perception. “Took” must not be understood as equivalent to “removed,” but as equivalent to “enrolled,” “registered,” as we find it elsewhere “take the sum of the spoils of the captivity” (Numb. xxxi. 26). What idea is it, then, that he wants to convey? </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="36"><p>The word “perception” is used in two ways, first in that of a condition, in which sense it is ours when we are asleep, secondly in the sense of an activity. From perception in the

<pb n="249"/>

former sense, as it is a state, we derive no benefit, for it does not enable us to apprehend the objects about us. It is from the second kind of perception, as an activity, that we get benefit, for our apprehension of the objects of sense-perception is made possible by this. </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="37"><p>Having, then, brought into being the former sort of perception as a quiescent condition, at the time when He was bringing the mind itself into being—for He made the mind with many faculties lying dormant—now it is His wish to produce perception as an activity. Active perception is brought to pass when quiescent perception has been set in motion and extended to reach the flesh and the perceptive organs. For, just as growth is effected by seed being set in motion, so is activity or actuality by a quiescent condition being set in motion.
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="38"><p><milestone unit="altchapter" n="11"/> “And he filled up flesh in its stead” (Gen. ii. 21), that is to say He fulfilled perception that was only a state by leading it on to be an activity, and extending it till it reached the flesh and the whole surface of the body. And so he adds the words, “He built it to be a woman” (Gen. ii. 22), proving by this that the most proper and exact name for sense-perception is “woman.” For just as the man shows himself in activity and the woman in passivity, so the province of the mind is activity, and that of the perceptive sense passivity, as in woman. </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="39"><p>It is easy to learn this from what is before our eyes. Sight is in a passive relation to the objects of sight that set it moving, white, black, and the rest. Hearing, again, is affected by sounds, and the sense of taste by savours, the sense of smell by odours, that of touch by things rough and smooth; and the faculties of perception are all dormant, until

<pb n="251"/>

there draws near to each of them from outside that which is to set it in motion.
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="40"><p> <milestone unit="altchapter" n="12"/> “And he led her to Adam; and Adam said, This is now bone out of my bones and flesh out of my flesh” (Gen. ii. 22, 23). God leads active perception to the mind, knowing that its movement and apprehensive power must revert to the mind as their starting-point. The mind, on beholding that, which it had before as a potentiality and as a dormant state, now become a finished product, an activity, and in motion, marvels at it, and cries aloud declaring that it is not foreign to it but in the fullest sense its own, </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="41"><p>for it says, “This is bone out of my bones,” that is, power out of my powers, for “bone” is here used as “power and strength”, “and feeling out of my feelings”; “and flesh,”
he says, “out of my flesh”; for not without the mind does the perceptive faculty bear anything that it feels, for the mind is to it a fountain-head and a basis on which it rests. </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="42"><p>It is worth our while to consider why the word” now ” was added: for what he says is, “This is <hi rend="italic">now</hi> bone out of my bones.”
Perception by itself is <hi rend="italic">now,</hi> subsisting only in relation to the present time. For whereas past, present, and future are within the scope of the mind, as it grasps things present, remembers things past, and looks forward to things future, </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="43"><p>perception, on the other hand, has no power either to reach out to future things by experiencing something corresponding to hope or expectation, nor does it remember things past, but it is so constituted as to be affected only by that which is present and sets it in motion at the moment. For instance, the eye has a sensation of white now under the influence of the

<pb n="253"/>

white that is present, but from that which is not present it feels no effect. The mind, on the contrary, is set in motion by occasion of that which is not present as well, if past, by way of memory, if future, by building hopes and expectations on it.

  ‘woman’” (Gen. ii. 23), as much as to say, for this cause shall perception be called “woman” because out of man that sets it in motion “this one is taken.”
Why, then is “this one” put in? Because there is another perception, not taken from the mind, but brought into being together with it. For there are, as I have said already, two perceptions, one existing as quiescent condition, the other as activity. </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="45"><p>The one, then, that exists as quiescent condition, is not taken out of the man, that is to say the mind, but comes into being with it. For the mind, as I have pointed out, when it came into existence, came into existence in association with many potentialities and conditions, those of reason, animal life, and growth, and so with that of perception also. But the one that exists as an activity comes out of the mind. For it was extended out of the perception which is in the mind as a condition, that it might come to be an activity. Thus the second one, the one that is characterized by movement, has been produced out of the mind itself. </p></div>

But mortal kind is prone of itself to hate virtue, and accordingly God has bestowed honour upon it and vouchsafes to her that is hated to bear the first-born. </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="48"><p>He says elsewhere, “If a man have two wives, one of them beloved and one of them hated, and they shall bear children to him and the first-born son be the son of the hated wife . . . he shall not be able to give the right of the first-born to the son of the beloved wife, overlooking the son of the hated one who is the first-born” (Deut. xxi. 15, 16): for first of all and most perfect of all are the offspring of the hated virtue, while the offspring of the well-loved pleasure are last of all.

For the sake of sense-perception the Mind, when it has become her slave, abandons both God the Father of the universe, and God’s excellence and wisdom, the Mother of all things, and cleaves to and becomes one with sense-perception and is resolved into sense-perception so that the two become one flesh and one experience. </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="50"><p>Observe that it is not the woman that cleaves to the man,

<pb n="257"/>

but conversely the man to the woman, Mind to Sense-perception. For when that which is superior, namely Mind, becomes one with that which is inferior, namely Sense-perception, it resolves itself into the order of flesh which is inferior, into sense-perception, the moving cause of the passions. But if Sense the inferior follow Mind the superior, there will be flesh no more, but both of them will be Mind. The man, then, of whom the prophet speaks is such as has been described; he prefers the love of his passions to the love of God. </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="51"><p>But there is a different man, one who has made the contrary choice, even Levi, who “said to his father and his mother’ I have not seen thee,’ and knew not his brethren, and disclaimed his sons” (Deut. xxxiii. 9).

Do you not see again that he prescribes that on the tenth day of the seventh month they should bring two goats, “one portion for the Lord and one for the averter of evil”? (Lev. xvi. 8). For in very deed the portion of the lover of passion is a passion that needs an averter.

The mind that is clothed neither in vice nor in virtue, but absolutely stripped of either, is naked, just as the soul of an infant, since it is without part in either good or evil, is bared and

<pb n="259"/>

stripped of coverings: for these are the soul’s clothes, by which it is sheltered and concealed. Goodness is the garment of the worthy soul, evil that of the worthless. </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="54"><p>Now there are three ways in which a soul is made naked. One is when it continues without change and is barren of all vices, and has divested itself of all the passions and flung them away. For this reason “Moses fixes his tent outside the camp, a long way from the camp, and it was called the tent of testimony” (Exod. xxxiii. 7).
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="55"><p> What this means is this. The soul that loves God, having disrobed itself of the body and the objects dear to the body and fled abroad far away from these, gains a fixed and assured settlement in the perfect ordinances of virtue. Wherefore witness is also borne to it by God that it loves things that are noble; “for,” says he, “it was called the tent of witness.” He leaves unmentioned who it is that calls it so, in order that the soul may be stirred up to consider who it is that bears witness to virtue-loving minds. </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="56"><p>This is why the high priest shall not enter the Holy of Holies in his robe (Lev. xvi. 1 ff.), but laying aside the garment of opinions and impressions of the soul, and leaving it behind for those that love outward things and value semblance above reality, shall enter naked with no coloured borders or sound of bells, to pour as a libation the blood of the soul and to offer as incense the whole mind to God our Saviour and Benefactor. </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="57"><p>Nadab and Abihu, too, who had drawn nigh to God and had forsaken the mortal life and become partakers of the life immortal are beheld naked of vain and mortal glory. For those who carried them away would not have borne them in their

For not to all must leave be given to contemplate the secret things of God, but only to those who are able to hide and guard them. </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="58"><p>And so Mishael and Elzaphan do not take them up in their own coats, but in those of Nadab and Abihu, who had been devoured by fire and been taken up (into heaven).

Now coats are those parts of the irrational by which the rational was hidden. </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="59"><p>Abraham too becomes naked when the words have been spoken to him, “Go forth out of thy country and thy kindred” (Gen. xii. 1). Isaac also does not indeed become naked, but is always naked and without body, for an injunction has been given him not to go down into Egypt (Gen. xxvi. 2), and “Egypt” is the body. Jacob, again, loves nakedness of the soul, for his smoothness signifies nakedness. “For Esau,” we read, “was a hairy man, but Jacob a smooth man” (Gen. xxvii. 11), and accordingly he has “Leah”
<note n="1.261.a">The Greek for ‘Leah’ (λεία) is the feminine of λεῖος, ‘smooth.’</note>
  as wife.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="60"><p>
<milestone unit="altchapter" n="16"/> This is one form, the noblest form, of stripping or becoming naked. The other is of a contrary nature, a deprivation of virtue due to a turning or change of condition, when the soul becomes foolish and deranged. This kind of stripping is experienced by Noah, who is made naked when he has drunk wine. But, thanks be to God, the change of condition and the stripping of the mind

<pb n="263"/>

which ensued upon the deprivation of virtue, did not spread out abroad and reach those outside, but stayed in the house, for what is said is “he was made naked in his house” (Gen. ix. 21): for the wise man, if he do commit sin, does not run riot, as does the bad man. The evil of the one has been spread forth; that of the other has been held in check; so he becomes sober again, that is to say, he repents and recovers as from an illness..</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="61"><p> Let us contemplate more in detail the fact that the stripping takes place in the house. When the soul in its perversion only purposes some outrage, but does not follow it up so as to complete it in action, the sin has been committed in the soul’s abode and house. But if, in addition to designing the bad deed, it goes on to carry out its design and do the thing, the unrighteous act has been spread out of doors as well.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="62"><p> It is in accordance with this that a curse is pronounced on Canaan, because he reported abroad the change of the soul. This means that he gave it fuller scope and wrought it out further, adding a further evil to the evil wish, even its accomplishment by deeds. Shem and Japhet on the other hand receive praise for not joining in the soul’s act but covering over its sad change.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="63"><p> For this reason also the vows and determinations of the soul are annulled, when they have been made in the house of father or husband (Numb. xxx. 4 ff.
<note n="1.263.a">See App. pp. 480, 481.</note>
 ), if the reason and reflection do not hold their peace and so add their weight to the soul’s failure, but remove the offence; for in that case the Lord of all also “shall cleanse her.” But he leaves with no removal the vow of a widow or of her that is cast off: “for whatever vows she shall have vowed,”

<pb n="265"/>

he says, “against her soul, abide for her” (Numb, xxx. 10). And this is reasonable. For if she has been cast off and gone forth to the parts outside, not turning merely but sinning by overt deeds, she abides incurable with no part in a husband’s admonition and deprived of her father’s persuasion.
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="64"><p>A third form of producing nakedness is the middle or neutral one. Here the mind is irrational and has no part as yet either in virtue or in vice. It is of this form that the prophet is speaking. In this the infant too is partaker. Accordingly the words,
“The two were naked, both Adam and his wife,”
amount to this: neither mind nor sense was performing its functions, the one being bare and barren of mental action and the other of the activity of sense-perception.
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="65"><p><milestone unit="altchapter" n="17"/> Let us look
again at the words, “they were not ashamed.”
<note n="1.265.a">See App. p. 481.</note>
  The words suggest three points for consideration: shamelessness, and shamefastness, and absence of both shamelessness and shamefastness. Shamelessness,
then, is peculiar to the worthless man, shamefastness to the man of worth, to feel neither shamefastness nor shamelessness to the man who is incapable of right apprehension and of due assent thereto, and this man is at this moment the prophet’s subject. For he who has not yet attained to the apprehension of good and evil cannot possibly be either shameless or shamefast. 
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="66"><p>
Examples of shamelessness are all those unseemly actions, when the mind uncovers shameful things which it ought to hide from view, and vaunts itself in them and prides itself on them. Even in the case of Miriam, when she spoke against Moses, it is said, “If her father had but spat in her face, should she not feel shame seven days?”

(Numb. xii. 14).</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="67"><p> For veritably shameless and bold was sense-perception in daring to decry and find fault with Moses for that for which he deserved praise. In comparison with him, who was “faithful in all God’s house” (<hi rend="italic">ibid</hi>.), sense-perception was set at naught by the God and Father; and it was God Himself who wedded to Moses the Ethiopian woman, who stands for resolve unalterable, intense, and fixed.
<note n="1.267.a">See App. p. 481.</note>
  For this Moses merits high eulogy, that he took to him the Ethiopian woman, even the nature that has been tried by fire and cannot be changed. For, even as in the eye the part that sees is black, so the soul’s power of vision has the title of woman of Ethiopia.

Sense-perception the origin of the perceiving by sense? How could it be said to be so, seeing that it is beyond the ken either of itself or of the mind? Do you not observe that the mind which thinks that it exercises itself is often found to be without mental power, in scenes of gluttony, drunkenness, folly? Where does the exercise of mind show itself then? And is not perceptive sense often robbed of the power of perceiving? There are times when seeing we see not and hearing

hear not, whenever the mind, breaking off its attention for a moment, is brought to bear on some other mental object. </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="70"><p>So long then as they are naked, the mind without self-exertion, the perceptive sense without perceiving, they have nothing shameful: but when they have begun to apprehend, they fall into shameful and wanton conduct, for they will be found often showing silliness and folly rather than healthy knowledge, not only in times of loathsome surfeit and depression and mad fooling but also in the rest of their life. For when bodily sense is in command, the mind is in a state of slavery heeding none of its proper objects; but when the mind is in the ascendant, the bodily sense is seen to have nothing to do and to be powerless to lay hold of any object of sense-perception.

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="71"><p> <milestone unit="altchapter" n="18"/> “Now the serpent was the most subtle of all the beasts on the earth, which the Lord God had made “(Gen. iii. 1). Two things, mind and bodily sense, having already come into being, and these being in nakedness after the manner that has been set forth, it was necessary that there should be a third subsistence, namely pleasure, to bring both of them together to the apprehension of the objects of mental and of bodily perception. </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="72"><p>For neither could the mind apart from bodily sense apprehend an animal or a plant or a stone or a log or any bodily shape whatever, nor could the bodily sense apart from the mind maintain the act of perceiving. Since then it was necessary that both of these should come together for the apprehension of the objects about them, who was it that brought them together save a third, a bond of love and desire, under the rule and dominion of pleasure, to which

<pb n="271"/>

the prophet gave the figurative name of a serpent? </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="73"><p>Exceeding well did God the Framer of living beings contrive the order in which they were created. First He made mind, the man, for mind is most venerable in a human being, then bodily sense, the woman, then after them in the third place pleasure. But it is potentially only, as objects of thought, that they differ in age; but in actual time they are equal in age. For the soul brings all together with herself, some parts in virtue of actual existence, others in virtue of the potentiality to arrive, even if they have not yet reached their consummation. </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="74"><p>The reason pleasure is likened to a serpent is this. The movement of pleasure like that of the serpent is tortuous and variable. To begin with it takes its gliding course in five ways, for pleasures are occasioned by sight and by hearing and by taste and by smell and by touch; but those connected with sexual intercourse prove themselves the most violent of all in their intensity, and this is the method ordained by Nature for the reproduction of the type.
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="75"><p>Furthermore the fact that pleasure insinuates itself about all the organs of the irrational portion of the soul is not the only reason for our calling her variable; for we call her so also because she glides with many a coil about each part. For instance variegated pleasures come through sight, those afforded by every kind of painting and of sculpture, and by all other artistic creations which in one art after another charm the eye; by the changes too that plants go through as they shoot up, bloom, and bear fruit; by the beauty of animals seen in so many forms. Similarly the ear gets pleasure from the flute, from the harp, from every kind of instrument, from the

<pb n="273"/>

tuneful voices of creatures without reason, swallows, nightingales, other birds which Nature has made musical; from the euphonious speech of beings endowed with reason, from musicians as they exercise their histrionic powers in comedy, tragedy, and all that is put on the stage.
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="76"><p><milestone unit="altchapter" n="19"/> What need to illustrate my point from the pleasures of the table? There are, we may roughly say, as many varieties of pleasure, as there are of dishes set before us stirring our senses with their delicious flavours. Pleasure being, then, a thing so variable, was it not fitly compared to a tortuous animal, the serpent? </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="77"><p>For this reason, too, when the part of us that corresponds to the turbulent mob of a city, pines for the dwellings in Egypt, that is, in the corporeal mass, it encounters pleasures which bring death, not the death which severs soul from body, but the death which ruins the soul by vice. For we read, “And the Lord sent among the people the deadly serpents, and they bit the people, and much people of the children of Israel died”
(Numb. xxi. 6). For verily nothing so surely brings death upon a soul as immoderate indulgence in pleasures. That which dies is not the ruling part in us, but the part that is under rule, the part that is like the vulgar herd. </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="78"><p>And so long will it incur death, as it fails to repent and acknowledge its fall. For they came to Moses saying, “We have sinned in that we spake against the Lord, and against thee. Pray therefore to the Lord, and let Him take away the serpents from us” (<hi rend="italic">ibid</hi>. 7). Tis well that they say,
<note n="1.273.a">See App. p. 481.</note>
  <hi rend="italic">not</hi> “We spake against, we sinned” <hi rend="italic">but</hi> “We sinned, we spake against.”

  For it is when the mind <hi rend="italic">has</hi> sinned and ceased to

cleave to virtue, that it blames God’s ways, fastening its own defection on God.
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="79"><p><milestone unit="altchapter" n="20"/> How, then, is a healing of their suffering brought about? By the making of another serpent, opposite in kind to that of Eve, namely the principle of self-mastery. For self-mastery runs counter to pleasure, a variable virtue to a variable affection, and a virtue that defends itself against pleasure its foe. So then God bids Moses make the serpent that expresses self-mastery, and says: “Make for thyself a serpent and set it upon a standard”
(<hi rend="italic">ibid.</hi> 8). You notice that Moses makes this serpent for no one else, but for himself, for God’s bidding is “Make it for thyself.” This is that you may know that self-mastery is not a possession of every man, but only of the man beloved of God. </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="80"><p>We must consider why Moses makes a brazen serpent, no direction having been given him as to material. Possibly these are the reasons. In the first place, matter is not an element in God’s gifts making them to be of this or that sort; but the gifts of us mortals are always looked upon embodied in matter. A second reason: Moses loves excellences without bodily form, whereas our souls, being unable to get out of our bodies, crave for excellence in bodily shape. </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="81"><p>But the principle of self-mastery, being forcible and unyielding, is likened to the strong and firm substance of brass, perhaps also because, whereas the self-mastery found in the man beloved of God is most precious and like gold, that which is found in him who has absorbed wisdom by gradual progress holds the second place. Everyone, then,
“whom a serpent shall have bitten, when he looks on it shall live” (<hi rend="italic">ibid</hi>.). This is quite true. For if the

<pb n="277"/>

mind, when bitten by pleasure, the serpent of Eve, shall have succeeded in beholding in soul the beauty of self-mastery, the serpent of Moses, and through beholding this, beholds God Himself, he shall live; only let him look and mark well.
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="82"><p><milestone unit="altchapter" n="21"/> Do
you not notice that Sarah, that is dominant wisdom, says: “For whosoever shall hear of it shall rejoice with me” (Gen. xxi. 6)? Just suppose that someone has succeeded in hearing that Virtue has given birth to Happiness (Isaac). Straightway he will sing a hymn of sympathetic joy. As then fellowship in joy is his who has heard of Isaac’s birth, so is escape from death his who has looked with clear vision on self-mastery and God.
<note n="1.277.a">See App. p. 481.</note></p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="83"><p>
 But many souls, after being enamoured of endurance and self-mastery and divested of passions, nevertheless do experience the might of God and receive the turning to the lower way, the Master making a sharp distinction between Himself and His creation. He Himself stands ever steadfast, while His creation wavers and inclines in opposite directions. </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="84"><p>For the prophet says: “Who led thee through that great and terrible wilderness, where there was biting serpent and scorpion and drought, where there was no water, who brought out a spring of water for thee from the hard rock, who fed thee with manna in the wilderness, which thy fathers knew not” (Deut. viii. 15 f.). You see that it is not only when attracted by the passions of Egypt that the soul falls in with the serpents, but when it is in a wilderness too it is bitten by pleasure, that subtle and snake-like passion. And pleasure’s mode of action has received a most appropriate name, for it is here called a biting. </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="85"><p>But not those in a wilderness only are bitten by pleasure, but those

<pb n="279"/>

also who are a prey to scattering. For many a time have I myself forsaken friends and kinsfolk and country and come into a wilderness, to give my attention to some subject demanding contemplation, and derived no advantage from doing so, but my mind scattered or bitten by passion has gone off to matters of the contrary kind. Sometimes, on the other hand, amid a vast throng I have a collected mind. God has dispersed the crowd that besets the soul and taught me that a favourable and unfavourable condition are not brought about by differences of place, but by God who moves and leads the car of the soul in whatever way He pleases.
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="86"><p>
To return to what I was saying, the soul falls in with a scorpion, which is “scattering,” in the wilderness, and the drought of the passions seizes upon it, until God send forth the stream from His strong wisdom and quench with unfailing health the thirst of the soul that had turned from Him. For the flinty rock is the wisdom of God, which He marked off highest and chief est from His powers, and from which He satisfies the thirsty souls that love God. And when they have been given water to drink, they are filled also with the manna, the most generic of substances, for the manna is called
“somewhat,” and that suggests the <hi rend="italic">summum genus</hi>. But the primal existence
<note n="1.279.a">Or “supremely generic.”</note>
  is God, and next to Him is the Word of God, but all other things subsist in word only, but in their active effects they are in some cases as good as non-subsisting.
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="87"><p> <milestone unit="altchapter" n="22"/> Note now a difference between him who turns aside in the wilderness and him who does so in Egypt. The one has experience of deadly serpents, that is to say insatiable pleasures inflicting

<pb n="281"/>

death; but the disciplined one is only bitten and scattered, not done to death, by pleasure. And while the one is cured by self-mastery, even the brazen serpent made by the wise Moses, the other is caused by God to drink a draught most excellent, even wisdom out of the fountain which He drew out from His own wisdom. </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="88"><p>Not even from Moses, most beloved of God, does Pleasure, the serpent-like one, refrain, but this is what we read: “If therefore they say, ‘God has not appeared to thee,’ and believe me not and hearken not to my voice, what shall I say to them? And the Lord said unto Moses, ‘What is that in thine hand?’ And he said, ‘A rod.’ And He said, ‘Cast it upon the ground.’ And he cast it upon the ground, and it became a serpent, and Moses fled from it. And the Lord said unto Moses, ‘Stretch forth thine hand and lay hold of its tail’ (and he stretched forth his hand and took hold of its tail, and it became a rod in his hand): that they may believe thee” (Exod. iv. 1 ff.). </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="89"><p> How
should one come to believe God? By learning that all other things change but He is unchangeable. Therefore God asks the wise man what there is in his hand or in the active life of his soul, for the hand represents activity; and he answers, “Schooling,”
giving it the name of a rod. So Jacob also, the supplanter of the passions, says, “For in my rod I crossed this Jordan” (Gen. xxxii. 10). The meaning of Jordan is “descent” or “coming down.” And to the nature that is down below, earthly, corruptible, belongs all that is done under the impulse of vice and passion. Over these Mind, the disciplined One, crosses in schooling himself. To take the words to mean that he crossed the river with a staff in

his hand would be tame.
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="90"><p><milestone unit="altchapter" n="23"/> Good, therefore is the reply of Moses beloved of God; for in truth the conduct of the virtuous man leans on discipline as on a rod, settling and allaying the tumult and tossing of the soul. This rod when cast away becomes a serpent; naturally; for if the soul casts away discipline, it at once becomes a lover of pleasure in place of a lover of virtue. And so Moses flies from it; for the lover of virtue runs away from passion and pleasure. </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="91"><p>But, mark you, God does not applaud his flight. For while it well befits thee, O my mind, who art not yet made perfect, to get practice by flying and running away from the passions, it befits Moses, the perfect one, not to desist from the warfare against them, but to resist them and fight it out. Otherwise, finding nothing to alarm or to stop them, they will make their way up to the very citadel of the soul, and storm and plunder the whole soul after the fashion of a lawless ruler. </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="92"><p>Wherefore also God bids him “lay hold of the tail.” This means,” Let not pleasure’s opposition and her savagery daunt thee. That is the very part to make for. Grip it fast and quell it; for then there shall be once more a rod instead of a serpent; that is to say, instead of pleasure there shall be in thy hand discipline.” </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="93"><p>But it is “in the <hi rend="italic">hand</hi>,” in the <hi rend="italic">doing</hi> of the wise man, that this shall come to pass. This is quite true. It would be impossible to lay hold of pleasure and get the mastery of it if the hand were not first stretched out, that is to say, if the soul were not first to acknowledge that all its achievements and successes are due to God’s impelling force and to refer nothing to itself. The man whose eyes are open determines to run away from

this serpent, and he fashions another, the principle of self-mastery, that serpent of brass, in order that the man who has been bitten by pleasure may, on seeing self-mastery, live the real life.

He introduces a doctrine showing that the bad man is an exile. For if virtue is a city peculiar to the wise, the man who has no capacity to partake of virtue has been driven away from the city, in which the bad man is incapable of taking part. It is accordingly the bad man only who has been driven away and sent into exile. But the exile from virtue has by incurring such exile hidden himself from God. For if the wise, as being His friends, are in God’s sight, it is evident that all bad men slink away and hide from Him, as is to be expected in men who cherish hatred and ill-will to right reason. </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="2"><p>The prophet, moreover, finds proof that the bad man is without city or dwelling-house, in the account of Esau, the hairy man, crafty in wickedness, when he says, “Esau was skilled in hunting, a countryman” (Gen. xxv. 27); for vice, that hunts after the passions, is by nature unfit to dwell in the city of virtue. Rather, in utter senselessness, it follows after rustic

Were one not to take the language as figurative, it would be impossible to accept the statement, for God fills and penetrates all things, and has left no spot void or empty of His presence. What manner of place then shall a man occupy, in which God is not? The prophet elsewhere bears witness of this saying, “God in heaven above and upon the earth beneath and there is none else but He” (Deut. iv. 39). And again,
“Here stand I before thou (wert made)” (Exod. xvii. 6); for before every created thing God is, and is found everywhere, so that no one could possibly hide himself from God. </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="5"><p>
And why should we marvel at this? Whatever should happen, we could never escape or hide ourselves from those, even among things created, that are essential elements of creation. For instance, let a man fly, if he can, from earth or water or air or sky or the world at large. </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="6"><p>A man must needs have all these round him, for no one shall ever be able to escape out of the world. Then, seeing a man is powerless to hide himself from the parts of the world or from the world itself, would he

be able to escape the eye of God? By no means. Why then does it say “they hid themselves”? The bad man thinks that God is in a place, not containing but contained; and for this reason he imagines that he can hide from Him, fancying that God, the Author of all things, is not in that part, which he has chosen for his lurking-place. </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="7"><p><milestone unit="altchapter" n="3"/> It is possible to take it in this way. In the bad man the true opinion concerning God is hidden in obscurity, for he is full of darkness with no divine radiance in him, whereby to investigate realities. Such an one is in banishment from the divine company, like the leper and the man with an issue.
<note n="1.305.a">See App. p. 482.</note>
  The former combines as joint causes God and creation, which are natures mutually hostile, for he shows two different colours,
<note n="1.305.b">Literally “there being two colours.” See Lev. xiii. 9–17. ‘Raw flesh’ and ‘white’ would seem to be the “two colours.”</note>
  whereas there is one single Cause, even He who doeth all. The man with an issue, on the other hand, deriving everything from the world, and making it return into the world, imagines that nothing has been created by God, associating himself with the opinion of Heracleitus, in his advocacy of such tenets as “fullness and want,”
“the universe one,” and “all things interchange.”</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="8"><p>
So the divine word saith, “Let them send forth out of the holy soul every leper, and everyone that hath an issue, and everyone that is unclean in soul, both male and female (Numb. v. 2), and eunuchs with the generative organs of the soul cut away, and fornicators, deserters from the rule of One, to whom entrance into the assembly of God is absolutely forbidden (Deut. xxiii. 2).</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="9"><p> But wise reasonings, so far from hiding themselves, are keenly desirous to be manifest. Do you not see that Abraham “was still standing before the Lord and drew nigh and

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="13"><p> So he withdraws from the godless opinion of Pharaoh, which the passions follow as their leader, and withdraws into Midian, the sifting-place, to inquire whether he is to be still or to dispute again with the evil man for his destruction; he considers whether, if he attack him, he shall prevail to win the victory, and so he is kept there waiting upon God, as I have said, to see whether He will bestow upon a deep reasoning faculty free from shallowness a stream sufficient to drown the onrush of the king of the Egyptians, the onrush, that is, of his passions.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="14"><p> And he is deemed worthy of the boon: for, having taken the field in the cause of virtue, he does not abandon the warfare till he beholds the pleasures prostrate and out of action. This is why Moses does not fly from Pharaoh, for that would have been to run away and not return, but, like an athlete taking an interval to regain his breath, “withdraws,” that is, brings about a cessation of arms, until he shall by divine words have raised forces of wisdom and every other virtue to aid him in renewing the attack with irresistible power.

<note n="1.311.a">See App. p. 482.</note>
  So he fled with all that he had; and passed over the river, and set his face toward the mountain of Gilead” (Gen. xxxi. 20 f.). It is thoroughly in accordance with true principles that he is said to have concealed the fact that he is running away and not made it known to Laban, who represents the way of thinking governed by objects of sense. For instance, if thou hast caught sight of beauty and been captivated by it, and if it is like to be a cause of stumbling to thee, fly secretly from the vision of it, and give no further report of it to thy mind, that is to say, do not give it another thought or ponder it: for to keep on recalling anything is the way to engrave on the mind distinct outlines of it, which injure the mind and often bring it to ruin against its will. </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="17"><p>The same principle holds in the case of every kind of attraction by the avenue of whatever sense it may reach us; for here safety lies in secret flight; but recalling the attractive object in memory, telling of it, turning it over, spells conquest and harsh slavery for our reasoning faculty.

“Jacob kept Laban the Syrian in the dark”? In this likewise there is a point not without pertinence. For “Syria” means “Highlands.” Jacob, therefore, the mind in training, when he sees passion grovelling low before him, awaits its onset calculating that he will master it by force, but when it is seen to be lofty, stately, weighty, the first to run away is the mind in training, followed by all his belongings, being portions of his discipline, readings, ponderings, acts of worship, and of remembrance of noble souls, self-control, discharge of daily duties; he crosses the river of objects of sense, that swamps and drowns the soul under the flood of the passions, and, when he has crossed it, sets his face for the lofty high-land, the principle of perfect virtue:</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="19"><p>
“for he set his face towards the mountain of Gilead.”
The meaning of this name is “migration of witness”; for God caused the soul to migrate from the passions that are represented by Laban, and bore witness to it how greatly to its advantage and benefit its removal was, and led it on away from the evil things that render the soul low and grovelling up to the height and greatness of virtue.
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="20"><p>For this reason Laban, the friend of the senses and the man whose actions are regulated by them and not by the mind, is vexed, and pursues him, and says,
“Why didst thou run away secretly” (Gen. xxxi. 26), but didst not remain in the company of bodily enjoyment and of the teaching that gives the preference to bodily and external good things? But in addition to fleeing from this view of life, thou

<note n="1.315.b">The things mutually at variance are true “well-being” and the lower delights, represented by the “music and tabrets and harp,” which, as Philo takes it, are to go with those released.</note>
  for hadst thou really sent forth and liberated the soul, thou wouldst have stripped from it all voices belonging to the body and senses: for it is in this way that the understanding is delivered from vices and passions. But as it is, thou <hi rend="italic">sayest</hi> that thou art ready to send her forth free, but by thy actions thou ownest that thou wouldst have detained her in prison; for if thou hadst sent her on her way with “music and tabrets and harp” and the pleasures that suit each several sense, thou wouldst not really have sent her forth at all. </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="22"><p>For it is not from thee only, O Laban, friend of bodies and of tints, that we are running away, but from all too that is thine: and this includes the voices of the senses sounding in harmony with the operations of the passions.

Jacob receives Shechem not from God, but by dint of “sword and bow,” words that pierce and parry.

  What soul, then, was it that succeeded in hiding away wickedness and removing it from sight, but the soul to which God manifested Himself, and which He deemed worthy of His secret mysteries? For He says: “Shall I hide from Abraham My servant that which I am doing?” (Gen. xviii. 17). It is meet, O Saviour, that Thou displayest Thine own works to the soul that longs for all beauteous things, and that Thou hast concealed from it none of Thy works.

For whereas thou thoughtest that God walked in the garden and was contained by it, learn that there was something amiss with thee in thinking this, and listen to a most true utterance from the mouth of God who knoweth, to the effect that God is not somewhere (for He is not contained but contains the universe), but that which came into being is in a place, for it must of necessity be contained but not contain. </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="52"><p>A second account is this: What is said is equivalent to “Where hast thou arrived, O soul?” In the place of how great goods, what evils hast thou chosen for thyself?

happiness the real life? </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="53"><p> Thirdly, there
is the interrogative sense, to which two answers might be made. One answer to the question, “Where art thou?” is “Nowhere,” for the soul of the bad man has no place where to find footing or upon which to settle. Owing to this the bad man is said to be
“placeless”—“placeless” is used of an evil that defies <hi rend="italic">placing</hi> (in any known category). Such is the man that is not good, always restless and unstable, drifting this way and that like a chopping wind, attaching himself absolutely to no fixed principle whatever. </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="54"><p>A second answer might be given to this effect. Adam in fact gave it. “Hear where I am; where those are who are incapable of seeing God; where those are who do not listen to God; where those are who hide themselves from the Author of all things; where are those that shun virtue, where are the destitute of wisdom, where those are who owing to unmanliness and cowardice of soul live in fear and trembling.

Even by this it is the prophet’s wish to teach thee, that he understands by nakedness not that of the body, but that by which the mind is found unprovided and unclothed with virtue.

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="56"><p>“The woman,” he says, “whom Thou gavest with me, she gave me of the tree, and I ate”
(Gen. iii. 12). It is well his not saying, “the

<pb n="339"/>

woman whom Thou gavest to me,” but “with me”; for Thou gavest not sense to me as a possession, but it too Thou didst leave free and at large, in some respects not subservient to the behests of my understanding. For instance, should the mind choose to bid the sight not to see, the sight will none the less see what lies before it. The hearing again, when a sound has reached it, will assuredly give it entrance, even if the mind resolutely command it not to hear. And the sense of smell, when odours have found their way in to it, will smell them, even though the mind forbid it to welcome them.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="57"><p> Owing to this God did not give sense-perception <hi rend="italic">to</hi> the living being, but <hi rend="italic">with</hi> the living being. What
“giving with” means is this. Sense becomes aware of all things with our mind and simultaneously with it. For instance, the visible object arrests simultaneously the attention of the sight and of the mind; for the eye caught sight of the material substance, and at once the mind took in the thing that had been seen, took in that it was black or white or yellow or red or triangular or square or round, or some other colour or shape. Again the hearing received the impression of the sound and the mind with it: in proof that it did, it immediately judged of the sound, pronouncing it weak or loud, tuneful and rhythmical, and on the other hand whether it is out of tune and a discord. We find the same thing in the case of the other senses. </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="58"><p> Quite excellent is the addition of the words “<hi rend="italic">she</hi> gave me of the tree.” For no one, except sense-perception, ever gives to the mind the tree with its sensibly-discerned bulk. For who gave to the mind the possibility of recognizing the body or whiteness? Did

<pb n="341"/>

not sight? Who gave it the sound? Did not the hearing? Who the odour? Did not the sense of smell? Who the savour? Did not the taste? Who the rough and the soft? Did not the touch? Rightly and with perfect truth was it said by the mind ‘sense-perception alone gives me opportunities of apprehending bodies.’</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="59"><p> <milestone unit="altchapter" n="19"/> “And God said to the woman, ‘What is this thou hast done?’
<note n="1.341.a">Or “Why didst thou do this?”</note>
  And she said, ‘The serpent beguiled me and I ate’” (Gen. iii. 13). God puts a question to sense-perception touching one point, she gives an answer touching another point: for God asks something about the man; she speaks not about him, but says something about herself, for her words are “I ate,” not “I gave.” </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="60"><p>Perhaps, then as we read the passage figuratively, we shall solve the puzzle and show that the woman gives a very pertinent answer to the question put to her. For it is a matter of necessity that when she ate, the man too should eat. For when sense-perception, meeting with the object of sense, is filled with the presentation of it, forthwith the mind also is in contact, takes hold and in a way absorbs the sustenance which it provides. This, then, is what she says: My giving it to the man was by no act of will, for even as I struck upon the object, he (so swift is he to move) received the image and impression of it himself.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="61"><p><milestone unit="altchapter" n="20"/> Now observe that, whereas the man says that the woman gave, the woman says not that the serpent gave but that he beguiled; for to give is characteristic of sense-perception but to cheat and beguile of pleasure with its serpent-like subtilty. For instance, sense-perception gives to the mind that which is by its nature white and that which is

<pb n="343"/>

black, that which is hot and that which is cold, quite truthfully and with no deceptions.
<note n="1.343.a">“I should say the reference is to the philosophers in the succession who held that αἴσθησις was true, Empedocles, probably Leucippus, and Epicurus himself, but not (e.g.) Parmenides or Democritus.”—CYRIL CYRIL In this case perhaps φυσικώτερον may be understood in the same sense as in <hi rend="italic">De Post</hi>, 7 (see note), where φυσικοὶ ἄνδρες are those who can discern the higher truths that underlie nature. Thus the whole phrase (τῶν μὴ φυσικώτερον φυσιολογούντων) means something like “materialistic philosophers.”</note>
  For, in the opinion of most people who do not overdo precision in their natural philosophy, objects are such as the appearance of them which meets the eye. But pleasure does not report the object to the mind such as it is, but artfully falsifies it, representing as something advantageous that which is of no benefit at all: </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="62"><p>even as it is possible to see repulsive courtesans applying pigments to their faces and painting under their eyes to conceal their ugliness.

Indeed they overlook those endowed with really faultless beauty, and pine for those whom I have mentioned. </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="64"><p>All kinds of consummate deception, then, are most proper to pleasure, while giving is the characteristic of sense-perception: pleasure outwits and misleads the mind, showing objects not as they are, but as they are not, whereas sense-perception simply gives the material forms just as nature has made them, without trickery or counterfeit.

  and thy belly shalt thou go, and earth shalt thou eat all the days of thy life. And I will put enmity between thee and the woman, and between thy seed and her seed. He shall watch for thy head, and thou shalt watch for his heel”
(Gen. iii. 14 f.). For what reason does He curse the serpent without giving it the opportunity to defend itself, though elsewhere, as seems reasonable, He commands that “the two parties between whom the dispute is should stand forth” (Deut. xix. 17) and that credit be not given to the one till the other be heard? </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="66"><p>Yet you see, no doubt, that He did not thus give credit to Adam, and prejudge the case against the woman, but gives her opportunity to defend herself, when He inquires “What is this that thou hast done?” (Gen. iii. 13), and she acknowledges that she failed owing to the deception practised on her by subtle serpent-like pleasure. When, then, the woman said “the serpent beguiled me,” what was there to prevent His inquiring here too from the serpent, whether he beguiled her, instead of prejudging the case and pronouncing the curse without listening to any defence? </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="67"><p>We have to say, then, that sense-perception comes under the head neither of bad nor of good things, but is an intermediate thing common to a wise man and a fool, and when it finds itself in a fool it proves bad, when in a sensible man, good. Reasonably then, since it has no evil nature on its own account, but halts between good and evil, inclining to either side, it is not pronounced guilty till it has owned that it

followed evil.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="68"><p> But the serpent, pleasure, is bad of itself; and therefore it is not found at all in a good man, the bad man getting all the harm of it by himself. Quite appropriately therefore does God pronounce the curse without giving pleasure an opportunity of defending herself, since she has in her no seed from which virtue might spring, but is always and everywhere guilty and foul.

For He is well aware that the body, our “leathern” bulk (“leathern” is the meaning of “Er”), is wicked and a plotter against the soul, and is even a corpse and a dead thing. For you must make up your mind that we are each of us nothing but corpse-bearers, the soul raising up and carrying without toil the body which of itself is a corpse. And note, if you will, how strong the soul is. </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="70"><p>The most muscular athlete would not have strength to carry his own statue for a short time, but the soul, sometimes for as long as a hundred years, easily carries the statue of the human being without getting tired; for it is not now (at the last) that God slays Er; nay, but the body which He made and which Er represents was a corpse to begin with.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="71"><p> By nature, as I have said, it is wicked and a plotter against the soul, but it is not evident to all that it is so, but to God alone and to anyone who is dear to God; for we read “Er was wicked in the sight of the Lord.” For when the mind soars aloft and is being initiated in the mysteries of the Lord, it judges the body to be wicked and hostile; but when it has abandoned the investigation of things

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="72"><p>The proof of this is that it takes refuge in what is dear to the body. On this account there is a difference between the soul of an athlete and the soul of a philosopher. For the athlete refers everything to the well-being of the body, and, lover of the body that he is, would sacrifice the soul itself on its behalf; but the philosopher being enamoured of the noble thing that lives in himself, cares for the soul, and pays no regard to that which is really a corpse, the body, concerned only that the best part of him, his soul, may not be hurt by an evil thing, a very corpse, tied to it.</p></div>

For it is not as Ruler and Governor employing the absolute power of sovereignty that He destroys the body, but in the exercise of goodness and kindness. For “God”
is the name of the goodness pertaining to the First Cause, and is so used that thou mayest know that He hath made the inanimate things also not by exercising authority but goodness, even as by goodness He hath made the living creatures. For it was necessary with a view to the clear manifestation of the superior beings that there should be in existence an inferior creation also, due to the same power, even the goodness of the First Cause. And that goodness is God. </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="74"><p> When, then, O soul,
wilt thou in fullest measure realize thyself to be a corpse-bearer? Will it not be when thou art perfected, and accounted worthy of prizes and crowns?

victory. Here is a proof of it. When Er has married her, he is immediately found to be wicked and slain. For we read, “And Judah took for Er his firstborn a wife whose name was Tamar” (Gen. xxxviii. 6), and the next words are, “And Er was wicked before the Lord, and God slew him” (<hi rend="italic">ibid</hi>. 7). For when the mind has carried off the rewards of victory, it condemns the corpse-body to death.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="75"><p> Thou seest that God both curses the serpent without allowing him to defend himself—for he is pleasure—and slays Er without bringing an open charge against him; for he is the body.

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="77"><p> <milestone unit="altchapter" n="24"/> Exactly, then, as God has conceived a hatred for pleasure and the body without giving reasons, so too has he promoted goodly natures apart from any manifest reason, pronouncing no action of theirs acceptable before bestowing his praises upon them. For should anyone ask why the prophet says that Noah found grace in the sight of the Lord God (Gen. vi. 8) when as yet he had, so far as our knowledge goes, done no fair deed, we shall give a suitable

answer to the effect that he is shown to be of an excellent nature from his birth, for Noah means
“rest” or “righteous.” But it cannot but be that he who rests from sinful and unrighteous acts and rests upon what is noble and lives in fellowship with righteousness, should find favour with God. </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="78"><p>Now <hi rend="italic">finding favour</hi> is not as some suppose equivalent only to being well-pleasing, but something of this kind besides. The righteous man exploring the nature of existences makes a surprising <hi rend="italic">find,</hi> in this one discovery, that all things are a <hi rend="italic">grace</hi> of God, and that creation has no gift of grace to bestow, for neither has it any possession, since all things are God’s possession, and for this reason grace too belongs to Him alone as a thing that is His very own. Thus to those who ask what the origin of creation is the right answer would be, that it is the goodness and grace of God, which He bestowed on the race that stands next after Him. For all things in the world and the world itself is a free gift and act of kindness and grace on God’s part.

He has not fashioned beforehand any deed of his, but produces him to begin with as such a king, peaceable and worthy of His own priesthood. For he is entitled “the righteous king,” and a “king” is a thing at enmity with a despot, the one being the author of laws, the other of lawlessness. </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="80"><p>So mind, the despot, decrees for both soul and body harsh and hurtful decrees working grievous woes, conduct, I mean, such as wickedness prompts, and free indulgence of the passions. But the king in the first place resorts to persuasion rather

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="87"><p>For instance joy, a happy condition of the soul, gladdens not only when it is present and in active operation, but, when still an object of hope, brings an anticipatory brightness. For here again is a peculiar advantage which it possesses. While other good things take effect in virtue of their own particular goodness only, joy is both a particular and a general good. See how it comes to add to and enrich them all. We rejoice over health, and over liberty, and over honour, and over the other good things, so that we say with literal truth that nothing is good unless joy be attached to it. But we rejoice over the other good things not only when they have already come about beforehand and are present, but also when they are looked for in the future, as when we hope that we shall grow rich, or shall obtain office, or shall win praise, or shall discover a way of getting rid of disease, or shall obtain our share of health and strength, or shall be no longer ignorant, but men of knowledge, we are glad in no small measure. Seeing then, that joy, not only when present but when hoped for, causes the soul to overflow with gladness, God fitly held Isaac, even before he was begotten, worthy of his great name and therein of a vast endowment: for “Isaac” means laughter of soul and joy and gladness.

For God the Maker of living beings knoweth well the different pieces of his own handiwork, even before He has thoroughly chiselled and consummated them, and the faculties which they are to display at a later time, in a word their deeds and experiences. And so when Rebecca, the soul that waits on God, goes to inquire of God, He tells her in reply, “Two nations are in thy womb, and two peoples shall be separated from thy belly, and one people shall be above the other people, and the elder shall serve the younger “(Gen. xxv. 23). </p></div>

this one too shall be exalted, but his younger brother shall be greater than he”? (Gen. xlviii. 19).</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="91"><p> What, then, does it behove us to say but this, that two exceedingly necessary faculties were created in the soul by God, memory, and recollection? Of these memory is the better, recollection the inferior.

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="92"><p>But the inferior of these, recollection, is discovered to be older than the superior one, memory: [while recollection has many gaps of forgetfulness, memory is] unbroken and uninterrupted. For when we are being first introduced to the various arts we are unable at once to master their principles; so finding ourselves liable to forgetfulness at the outset, we afterwards recollect, until as the result of repeated forgetting and repeated recollecting an unfailing memory shall subsequently win the day. Accordingly memory, being late-born, is formed as recollection’s younger sister.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="93"><p> So then Ephraim is the figurative name of Memory, meaning “fruit-bearing,”
for the soul of the student has borne its proper fruit when it is able by means of memory to hold securely the principles of the art that is being learned. Manasseh, however, represents recollection, for the name is said to mean “out of forgetfulness”
when translated, and he who escapes from forgetfulness necessarily recollects. Most rightly, therefore, does Jacob, the overthrower of the passions and the trained seeker of virtue, lay his right hand on Ephraim as fruitful memory, and count Manasseh, who is recollection, worthy of the second place.

  he assigns the second place, for after turning they retraced the wrong steps they had taken and as though they had forgotten their duties they set out again to perform them, while the earlier sacrificers held on without turning. So Manasseh, who comes “out of forgetfulness,” corresponds to those who offer the second Passover, the fruit-bearing Ephraim to those who offer the earlier one.

(Exod. xxxiii. 13); ‘for I would not that Thou shouldst be manifested to me by means of heaven or earth or water or air or any created thing at all, nor would I find the reflection of Thy being in aught else than in Thee Who art God, for the reflections in created things are dissolved, but those in the Uncreate will continue abiding and sure and eternal.’ This is why God hath expressly called Moses and why He spake to Him. </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="102"><p>Bezalel also He hath expressly called, but not in like manner. One receives the clear vision of God directly from the First Cause Himself. The other discerns the Artificer, as it were from a shadow, from created things by virtue of a process of reasoning. Hence you will find the Tabernacle and all its furniture made in the first instance by Moses but afterwards by Bezalel, for Moses is the artificer of the archetypes, and Bezalel of the copies of these. For Moses has God for

<note n="1.371.a">See App. p. 483.</note>
  to which He has given the title of “heaven”; and that He may close up the treasuries of evil things. </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="105"><p>For there are with God treasuries as of good things so also of evil things, as He saith in the great Song,
<note n="1.371.b">Philo often refers to Deuteronomy xxxii. under this title.</note>
  “Are not these laid up in store with Me, sealed up in My treasuries in the day of vengeance, when their foot shall have slipped?” (Deut. xxxii. 34 f.). You see that there are treasuries of evil things. And the treasury of good things is one, for since God is One, there is likewise one treasury of good things. But of evil things there are many treasuries, for countless too


<pb n="373"/>

are those that sin. But here too observe the goodness of Him who is. The treasury of good things He opens, those of evil things He closes. For it is God’s property to hold out good things and to be beforehand in bestowing them, but to be slow to inflict evil things. </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="106"><p>But Moses, magnifying God’s love of giving gifts and granting favours, says that the treasuries of evil things are sealed up not only at other times, but also when the soul fails to direct its steps in keeping with the right principle; and yet then it might justly have been deemed worthy of punishment. For he says that the treasuries of evil things were sealed in the day of vengeance, the sacred word thus showing that not even against those who sin will God proceed at once, but gives time for repentance and for the healing and setting on his feet again of him who had slipped.

  deserves prayer, so pleasure, the passion <hi rend="italic">par excellence</hi>, deserves cursing; it shifts the standards of the soul and renders it a lover of passion instead of a lover of virtue:—“Accursed,” says Moses in the Curses, “is he who removes his neighbour’s landmarks” (Deut. xxvii. 17):—for God set as a landmark and law for the soul virtue, the tree of life. This is removed by the man who has fixed as landmark in its stead wickedness, the tree of death. </p></div>

is a blind thing, inasmuch as it is irrational, for it is the reasoning faculty that confers sight. </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="109"><p>Accordingly it is with the reason only that we apprehend matters; sense does not carry us so far; for by means of sense we gain impressions only of the material forms of things. Pleasure, then, has cheated poor maimed sense of the power of apprehending matters, inasmuch as, when it could have had recourse to mind and have secured it for its charioteer, it has prevented it, leading it to what can be perceived externally only, and by giving it a craving for that which produces pleasure, to the end that sense, being a maimed thing, may follow a blind guide, namely that which sense can perceive, and that the mind, led by this pair of blind guides, may be brought to the ground and robbed of self-control.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="110"><p>
For if there had been any correspondence with what nature prescribes, it would have been incumbent upon the maimed faculties to follow the reasoning faculty which has eyes, for in this way the damage incurred would have been diminished. As it is, pleasure has organized such a shrewd device against the soul, that it has compelled it to employ blind guides, inducing it by delusive wiles to change virtue for evil things, and to surrender its innocence and receive wickedness in lieu of it. Such an exchange too is forbidden by the holy word, when it says, “Thou shalt not change good with evil”
(Lev. xxvii. 33).  </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="111"><p> Accursed on these
grounds is pleasure. Let us see how appropriate the curses are which He pronounces upon it. He says that it is cursed from all cattle (Gen. iii. 14). Our irrational faculty of sense-perception, then, is of the cattle kind, and each of our senses curses

<pb n="377"/>

pleasure as a most deadly enemy: for it is in very deed hostile to sense, as is proved by the fact that, when we have glutted ourselves with immoderate pleasure, we cannot see nor hear nor smell nor taste nor feel with clearness, but our contact with objects of sense is dim and feeble. </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="112"><p>This is what we experience when we have ceased from indulging in pleasure; but when we are in the very midst of the enjoyments it affords, we find ourselves utterly deprived of the support that we obtain through the co-operation of the senses, to such an extent that we seem to have been maimed. How, then, should not sense rightly lay curses on pleasure that maims it?
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="113"><p> <milestone unit="altchapter" n="37"/> It is cursed also beyond all the wild beasts. By these I mean the passions of the soul, for by these the mind is wounded and destroyed, Why, then, is it accounted worse than the other passions? Because it is, we may say, at the bottom of them all, like a kind of starting-point and foundation. Lust comes into play through love of pleasure; pain arises as pleasure is withdrawn; fear again is engendered owing to a dread of being without pleasure. It is clear, then, that all the passions depend on pleasure, and these would perchance never have taken shape at all, if first there had not been deposited that which is productive of them, pleasure.

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="114"><p> <milestone unit="altchapter" n="38"/> “On thy breast and belly shalt thou go “(Gen. iii. 14), For passion has its lair in these parts of the body, the breast and the belly. When pleasure has the materials it needs to produce it, it haunts the belly and the parts below it. But when it is at a loss for these materials, it occupies the breast where wrath is; for lovers of pleasure when

deprived of their pleasures grow bitter and angry. </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="115"><p>Let us look still more carefully at the thing signified. Our soul consists of three parts, and has one part given to reasoning, a second to high spirit, a third to desire. Some philosophers
<note n="1.379.a">See App. p. 478, note on <hi rend="italic">L.A.</hi> i. 70.</note>
  have distinguished these parts from each other in regard to function, some in regard also to the places which they occupy. These have gone on to assign to the reasoning part the region of the head, saying that, where the king is, there are also his bodyguards, and that the senses which are in the region of the head are bodyguards of the mind, and that it follows that the king must be there too, having had it allotted to him, like a castle in a city, for his dwelling. To the spirited part they assign the breast, pointing out that nature has given that part firmness by means of a strong and solid array of continuous bones, as though she were arming a good soldier with shield and breastplate for defence against opponents. To the lustful portion of the soul they assign the quarter about the abdomen and the belly, for there it is that lust, irrational craving, has its abode.
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="116"><p><milestone unit="altchapter" n="39"/> If, therefore, O mind, thou art ever inquiring what quarter pleasure has for her portion, do not consider the place occupied by the head, where the reasoning faculty resides, for thou wilt assuredly not find it there, since reason is at war with passion, and cannot remain in the same place with it. For when reason prevails pleasure is gone, and when pleasure conquers, reason is an exile. But look for it in the breast and belly, where high spirit and desire are, portions of the irrational: for in the irrational is to be found alike our faculty of

choice
<note n="1.381.a">By emphasizing “our” Philo perhaps means that the faculties of the Soul of the Universe are not hampered, as are ours, in choosing what course to take, by desire or ambition or shrinking from pain. Plutarch says that in face of the fact that human faculties are thus hampered, some philosophers said that our πάθη are λόγοι or κρίσεις, i.e. exercises of reason in choosing; while others said that every virtue has in it an element of fear, or desire for pleasure or for gain.

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="117"><p>Well, there is nothing to prevent the mind from going out from the purely intellectual interests which are proper to it and giving itself up to its inferior. This happens when war prevails in the soul;

  for then reason, that is in us not as a combative but as a peaceful inmate, cannot fail to become a prisoner of war.
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="118"><p><milestone unit="altchapter" n="40"/> For look now: the Sacred Word knowing how strong is the impulse of either passion, of both high spirit and lust, puts a curb on each of them, by setting over them reason as a charioteer and pilot. And in the first place this is how it discourses concerning high spirit, aiming at curing and healing it:</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="119"><p> 
“And thou shalt put on to the oracle of the judgements the Showing and the Truth, and it shall be upon Aaron’s breast, whenever he enters into the Holy Place before the Lord” (Exod. xxviii. 30). The “oracle,” then, is in us the organ of speech, which is the uttered word: and this may either be rejected as spoken at random or may be approved as well-judged: but the sacred writer is leading us to think of the word spoken with judgement and discernment; for he tells us that the oracle is not the untested or counterfeit one, but “the oracle of the judgements,” an expression tantamount to “well tested and examined.” </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="120"><p>To this approved word he says that the two virtues belong, the highest possible, clearness and truthfulness. Quite rightly does he say so. For reason at the outset fell short of making matters clear and evident to another, since we have no power to exhibit the affection called out in the



<pb n="383"/>

soul by external things nor to convey an idea of its character.
<milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="41"/> Wherefore we were compelled to resort to signs given by means of the voice, nouns and verbs, which cannot fail to be intelligible,
<note n="1.383.a">Or “which need to be thoroughly known.”</note>
  that the other may get a clear and unmistakable idea of our meaning. (This was reason’s first inadequacy.) In the second place, it was inadequate to report things truly. </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="121"><p>For what is the good of giving a clear and distinct expression, if it be in other respects false? For under these circumstances the hearer must needs be deceived and incur a very great misfortune, being not merely ignorant but ill-taught into the bargain. For what if, pointing to the letter alpha I say to the boy clearly and distinctly that it is gamma, or to eta and tell him that it is omega? Or what if the music-master tells the beginner as he points to the enharmonic genus that it is the chromatic, or says of the chromatic that it is the diatonic, or of the note on the highest string that it is the central, or of the conjunct that it is the disjunct tetrachord, or of the highest tone in the tetrachord scale that it is the lowest? </p></div>

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="123"><p><milestone unit="altchapter" n="42"/> It says, then, that the tested word, having the virtues which are peculiarly its own, was enthroned upon the breast (Aaron’s namely), that is, upon the spirited element, that this might first of all be guided by reason, and not injured by its own

irrationality; in the next place by clearness, for it is not the nature of anger to be a friend of clearness. Do we not see in those who are enraged how not their understanding only but their words also are full of disturbance and confusion? It was appropriate therefore that anger’s lack of clearness should be set right again by clearness. </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="124"><p>It must be guided in the third place by truthfulness, for together with its other faults anger has this one also as peculiarly its own, that of lying. As a matter of experience, of those who give way to this passion, hardly one speaks the truth. They are victims of an intoxication not of body but of soul. These are antidotes for the region of anger; reason, clearness of speech, truth of speech. For the three are virtually one, since reason, accompanied by the two virtues of truthfulness and distinctness, acts as a healer of anger, that sore sickness of the soul.
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="125"><p> <milestone unit="altchapter" n="43"/> To whom, then, does it pertain to bear these? Not to my understanding or to that of any chance comer, but to that which exercises its priesthood and offers sacrifices in purity, that of Aaron, and not even to this always, for many a time it turns and fails, but when it continues free from turning, when it enters into the Holy Place, when the reasoning faculty enters in together with holy resolves and does not abandon these. </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="126"><p>But full often does the mind enter with these into sacred and holy and purified opinions, but these are mere human opinions, as for instance those concerning simple duties, those concerning high-standard actions, those concerning usages resting on human enactment, those concerning virtue conforming to human standards.

<pb n="387"/>

is sufficient to bear the oracle upon his breast with the virtues that belong to it, but he only who goes in in the sight of the Lord, that is he who does all things for God’s sake, and overvalues none of the things that are of less importance than God, but accords to these also all they deserve, not, however, stopping at them, but mounting up in the endeavour to acquaint himself with and know and honour the One. </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="127"><p>For he who is in this case will have his spirited element charioteered by purified reason, which will abolish all that is irrational in him, and by clearness, which will heal all that is uncertain and confused, and by truthfulness, which will eliminate falsehood.
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="128"><p> <milestone unit="altchapter" n="44"/> Aaron, then, being inferior to Moses who cuts the breast, that is the spirited element, clean out—suffers it not to be carried away by random impulses, for he is afraid that, if it be given the rein, it may some day get unmanageable, as a horse does, and trample down all the soul. No, he curbs and controls it, first by reason, that being driven by an excellent charioteer it may not get too restive; next he employs the virtues of speech, distinctness, and truth. For if high spirit be trained in this manner, so as to yield to reason and distinctness, and also to exercise itself in eschewing falsehood, it will not only rid itself of much ferment, but will render the whole soul gentle.
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="129"><p> <milestone unit="altchapter" n="45"/> Well, Aaron, as I have said, having this passion, attempts to cure it by the saving medicines that have been mentioned. Moses, on the other hand, thinks it necessary to use the knife on the seat of anger in its entirety, and to cut it clean out of the soul, for no moderation of passion
<note n="1.387.a">See App. p. 483.</note>
  can satisfy him; he is content with nothing but complete

<pb n="389"/>

absence of passion. That what I say is true Holy Writ testifies: for it says, “Moses took the breast and removed it as a crowning offering before the Lord from the ram of consecration and it became Moses’ portion “(Lev. viii. 29). </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="130"><p>Very good; for it was the business of the man who loved virtue and was beloved of God, when he had contemplated the entire soul, to seize the breast, which is the spirited element, and to cut it off and take it away, in order that, through the excision of the warlike part, the remainder might have peace. He removes it, not from this or that animal, as it may happen, but from the ram of consecration, although there was a heifer offered too. But he passed this by and went to the ram, because it is a creature naturally prone to butt, owing to its being full of spirit and ready for the fray. It is owing to this that engineers make most of the engines of war in the shape of rams.
<note n="1.389.a">Philo perhaps wrote κριοῖς. That battering-rams were “adorned with” a ram’s head may be seen in the illustration in Seyffert’s <hi rend="italic">Dictionary of Antiquities</hi>, p. 64 a.</note>
  </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="131"><p>The part of us, then, that resembles a ram in his reckless readiness for a fight is the wrangling species; and wrangling is the mother of anger; accordingly it is those who contend most eagerly in debates and other gatherings that most easily lose their tempers. So Moses cuts out, as he needs must, anger, discordant offspring of the soul that loves wrangling and contention. He does this that she may be rendered barren, and cease bearing hurtful progeny, and that <hi rend="italic">this</hi> may become a portion befitting the lover of virtue, not the breast nor the seat of high spirit, but the removal of these: for God assigned to the wise man a share of surpassing excellence, even the power to cut out the passions. You observe how the perfect man always makes perfect freedom from passion his study. </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="132"><p>But Aaron,

<pb n="391"/>

the man who is making gradual progress, holding a lower position, practises moderation, as I have said; for his power does not go so far as to enable him to cut out the breast and the high-spirited element, but he brings to it, as charioteer and guide, reason with the virtues attached to it, and this is the oracle on which is Clear-showing and Truth.
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="133"><p><milestone unit="altchapter" n="46"/> But he shall bring out the difference more clearly by means of the following words: “The breast of the offering put on, and the shoulder of the part removed, I have taken at the hands of the children of Israel from the sacrifices of your salvation, and have given to Aaron and his sons” (Lev. vii. 34). </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="134"><p>You see that these are not capable of taking the breast by itself, but must take it with the shoulder, whereas Moses takes it without the shoulder. Why is this? Because he, being perfect, has no small or petty aims, nor any desire to moderate his passions, but goes so far as to cut off all passions everywhere; while those others set out to wage war on the passions on an insignificant, not on a grand, scale, but seek to come to terms and arrange a truce with them, putting forward the word of pacification, that this like a charioteer may curb their excessive impetuosity. </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="135"><p>Furthermore the shoulder is a symbol of toil and hardship; and this is the character of him who attends to and ministers in holy things, subject to toil and discipline. But the man on whom God bestows in overflowing measure his good things in perfection is free from toil. He who acquires virtue by toil is found to come short of full achievement, as compared with Moses, who received it easily and without toil from the hands of God. For, as toiling itself falls short of the toilless achievement

<pb n="393"/>

and is inferior to it, so does the imperfect fall short of the perfect, and that which learns of that which is self-taught.
<note n="1.393.a">i.e., taught directly by God or by Virtue’s self.</note>
  This is why Aaron takes the breast with the shoulder, but Moses without the shoulder. </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="136"><p>The reason why he calls it the breast of “the special offering put on” is that it is necessary that the reason should be put and set firmly on the seat of anger, as though it were a kind of charioteer keeping straight a stiff-necked and restive horse. But when he comes to the shoulder he speaks of it not as in the case of the breast, as belonging to
“the offering put on,” but as belonging to “that which was removed.” The reason he does so is this. It is necessary that the soul should not ascribe to itself its toil for virtue, but that it should take it away from itself and refer it to God, confessing that not its own strength or power acquired nobility, but He who freely bestowed also the love of it. </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="137"><p>Neither breast nor shoulder is taken except from the sacrifice of salvation. That is fitting. For only then does the soul begin to be saved, when the seat of anger has received reason as its charioteer, and toil has come to create in it, not self-satisfaction, but a readiness to yield the honour to God, the Bestower of the boon.
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="138"><p><milestone unit="altchapter" n="47"/> We have already mentioned that pleasure goes not only on its breast but also on its belly, and pointed out that the stomach is a place most appropriate to pleasure, for we may almost describe it as a reservoir of all the pleasures. For when the belly has been filled, cravings after the other pleasures also become vehement, but when it has been emptied, these are quieted and become more still. </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="139"><p>And so the prophet says in another passage, “Whatsoever

<pb n="395"/>

goeth upon
<note n="1.395.a">ἐπί with dative.</note>
  the belly, and whatsoever goeth all the time upon four feet, which hath many feet, is unclean “(Lev. xi. 42). The lover of pleasure answers to this description, always going after
<note n="1.395.b">ἐπί with accusative.</note>
  the belly and the pleasures of the adjoining parts. With that which creepeth after
<note n="1.395.b">ἐπί with accusative.</note>
  the belly he has associated that which walketh upon
<note n="1.395.c">ἐπί with genitive.</note>
  four feet; and quite naturally; for the passions that come under the head of those in the realm of pleasure are four in number, as has been mentioned in a treatise specially devoted to that subject.
<note n="1.395.d">This treatise was never written or is lost.</note>
  Accordingly a man is unclean who is given up to the one thing, pleasure, as well as the man who has all four passions for his stay.
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="140"><p> Now that we have said this, note once more how a perfect man differs from one making gradual progress. We have already discovered the perfect man cutting out the seat of anger entirely from the wrangling soul, and so rendering it gentle and submissive and peaceable, and cheerfully ready to face every demand both in act and word; while the man of gradual improvement was found powerless to cut away the passion, for the breast is Aaron’s portion,
<note n="1.395.e">Lev. vii. 3. Literally “for he bears away the breast.”</note>
  but schooling it by well-tested speech, attended by two virtues, clearness and truth.
<milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="48"/> In a corresponding manner we shall now find Moses, the wise man, in his perfection, scouring away and shaking off pleasures, but the man of gradual improvement not so treating pleasure in its entirety, but welcoming simple and unavoidable pleasure, while declining that which is excessive and over-elaborate
in the way of delicacies. For in the case of Moses he uses this language: </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="141"><p>“And he washed with water the belly and the feet of the whole burnt-offering
“(Lev. ix. 14). It is excellently said; for

<pb n="397"/>

the wise man consecrates his whole soul as being worthy to be offered to God, owing to its freedom from voluntary or involuntary blemish; and, being in this condition, he washes out and bathes away and scours off the whole belly and the pleasures that it and the parts adjoining it yield, not so dealing with some part of it, but filled with such contempt for the whole, that he rejects even necessary food and drink, being fed by the contemplation of things divine. </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="142"><p>And therefore witness is borne to him in another place also: “for forty days he ate no bread and drank no water “(Exod. xxxiv. 28), when he was in the holy mount and listened to the divine communications made by God as He declared His laws. But not only does he renounce the whole belly, but with it he scours away the feet, that is, the supports
<note n="1.397.a">Or “means of approach.”</note>
  of pleasure; but the things that create pleasure are its supports,
<note n="1.397.a">Or “means of approach.”</note>
  </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="143"><p>for the man of gradual improvement is said to wash the inwards and the feet (Lev. i. 9), not the whole belly: for he is not sufficient to thrust from him pleasure in its completeness, but is content if he can get rid of its inwards, that is, of the delicacies, produced by the elaborate skill of dainty cooks and confectioners, of which we are told by the epicures that they serve, if we may so speak, as a means of giving succulence to the principal pleasures.
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="144"><p><milestone unit="altchapter" n="49"/> He lays further stress upon the mere moderating of passion in the man of gradual advance, by representing the wise man as declining without any bidding all the pleasures of the belly, while the man of gradual advance acts under orders; for in the wise man’s case what is said is “he washed with water the belly and the feet “(Lev. ix. 14), spontaneously and unbidden,

<pb n="399"/>

but in the case of the priests it is on this wise: “the inwards and the feet,” not “they washed”
but “they shall wash” (Lev. i. 9). This shows great exactness. For it must needs be that while the perfect man moves of himself towards virtuous actions, the man who is practising should do so with the aid of reason which gives him guidance what he should do, obedience to whose directions is a noble thing.
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="145"><p>We must not fail to notice that Moses, when he refuses the entire belly, that is the filling of his stomach, practically renounces the other passions too. The lawgiver uses one portion to give from it a clear presentation of the whole; and having mentioned the most essential matter, virtually treats of the rest about which he has been silent.

Because the perfect wise man can, by wholly renouncing anger, utterly avert and drive off the uprising of the spirited element in him, but to exscind the belly he is powerless. Even the man of fewest needs who scorns the very necessaries of life and trains himself in abstinence from them, is forced by nature to take necessary food and drink. Let him therefore wash the belly and cleanse it from superfluous and unclean provisions; for this too is a sufficiently great gift from God to the lover of virtue.

passion, “it will swell up in the belly,”
which signified that it will have ever unfilled and insatiable the pleasures and desires of the belly, and will never cease to be insatiate owing to gross stupidity, but, with a countless throng of them pouring in, will keep its passion for ever. </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="149"><p>To cite an instance, I know many brought to such disaster over the craving of the belly, that after resorting to emetics they fly back again to strong drink and all the rest.

We see this from the words that follow, “If she have not been defiled and be pure, she shall be free and shall conceive seed “(Numb. v. 28), if she have not been defiled by passion, but have been chaste and faithful to her lawful husband, the princely and wholesome principle, she will have a soul fruitful and productive, yielding the offspring of sound sense and righteousness and all excellence.

How <hi rend="italic">can</hi> it be possible? But look. The sacred guide tells the man who feels the pressure of bodily necessity the way to deal with it, namely, to comply with it only so far as he is actually obliged to do so. First he says, “Let there be to thee a place outside the camp “(Deut. xxiii. 12), meaning by “the camp “virtue, in which the soul has pitched its camp. For good sense and indulgence of a bodily necessity cannot occupy the same quarters. </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="152"><p>Next he says, “Thou shalt go forth there without.”
Why go forth? Because the soul cannot have dealings with any of the body’s friends while it abides with good sense and spends its days in the house of wisdom. For then it is nourished by food more divine, which it finds in all knowledge, and for the sake of this it actually disregards the flesh. For when it has gone forth from the sacred dwellings of virtue, it is then that it turns to material things which treat the body ill and weigh it down. How

then shall I deal with them? </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="153"><p> “Let there be to thee, he says, a shovel upon thy girdle, and thou shalt dig with it” (Deut. xxiii. 13), that is to say, reason shall be upon the passion digging it out, tucking it up, not suffering it to clothe thee about.

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="154"><p>So at the crossing over from them, which is called Passover, He bids that their “loins should be girded up “(Exod. xii. 11), in other words that their desires should be restrained.

(Gen. iii. 14). For pleasure does not belong to the category of things becalmed and stationary, but to that of things moving and full of turmoil. For as the flame is in movement, so, not unlike a blazing thing, passion moving in the soul does not suffer it to be calm. Thus the prophet does not agree

with those who say that pleasure is tranquil.

  For stillness pertains to a stone and a log and to everything without life, but it is alien to pleasure.

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="161"><p> <milestone unit="altchapter" n="55"/> The sentence “Earth shalt thou eat all the days of thy life “(Gen. iii. 14) is an apt one. For the food of the body brings pleasures of earth; and fitly so, it would seem. For there are two things of which we consist, soul and body. The body, then, has been formed out of earth, but the soul is of the upper air, a particle detached from the Deity: “for God breathed into his face a breath of life, and man became a living soul” (Gen. ii. 7). It is in accordance with reason, therefore, that the body fashioned out of earth has food akin to it which earth yields, while the soul being a portion of an ethereal nature has on the contrary ethereal and divine food; for it is fed by knowledge in its various forms and not by meat and drink, of which the body stands in need.
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="162"><p> <milestone unit="altchapter" n="56"/> That the food of the soul is not earthly but heavenly, we shall find abundant evidence in the Sacred Word. “Behold I rain upon you bread out of heaven, and the people shall go out and they shall gather the day’s portion for a day, that I may prove them whether they will walk by My law or not “(Exod. xvi. 4). You see that the soul is fed not with things of earth that decay, but with such words as God shall have poured like rain out of that lofty and pure region of life to which the prophet has given the title of “heaven.” </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="163"><p>To

<pb n="411"/>

proceed. The people, and all that goes to make the soul, is to go out and gather and make a beginning of knowledge, not all at once but “the day’s portion for a day.” For to begin with it will be unable to contain all at once the abundant wealth of the gracious gifts of God, but will be overwhelmed by them as by the rush of a torrent. In the second place it is better, when we have received the good things sufficient of themselves as duly measured out to us, to think of God as Dispenser of those that still remain. </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="164"><p>He that would fain have all at once earns for himself lack of hope and trust, as well as great lack of sense.

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="165"><p><milestone unit="altchapter" n="57"/> Gather together, therefore, O soul, what is adequate of itself and suitable, and neither more than sufficient so as to be excessive, nor on the other hand less so as to fall short, that dealing in right measures thou mayest do no wrong.

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="166"><p>Both in the case of manna then, and in the case of every boon which God confers upon our race, it is good to take what is fixed by strict measure and reckoning and not that which is above and beyond us; for to do this is to be over-reaching.

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="167"><p><milestone unit="altchapter" n="58"/> And the reason for the injunction we are considering seems to me to be this. The day is a symbol of light, and the light of the soul is training. Many, then, have acquired the lights in the soul for night and darkness, not for day and light; all elementary lessons for example, and what is called school-learning and philosophy itself when pursued with no motive higher than parading their superiority,
<note n="1.413.a">Or “than luxurious living.”</note>
  or from desire of an office under

  our rulers. But the man of worthy aims sets himself to acquire day for the sake of day, light for the sake of light, the beautiful for the sake of the beautiful alone, not for the sake of something else. And this is why he goes on with the words: “that I may prove them whether they will walk in My law or no”
(Exod. xvi. 4); for this is the divine law, to value excellence for its own sake. </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="168"><p>The right principle, therefore, tests all aspirants as one does a coin, to see whether they have been debased in that they refer the soul’s good to something external, or whether, as tried and approved men, they distinguish

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="169"><p> <milestone unit="altchapter" n="59"/> He gives a further elucidation of this point, when he says, “in the early morning when the dew ceased it appeared all round the camp, and lo! upon the face of the wilderness a fine thing as it were coriander seed, white like hoar-frost on the ground. And when they saw it, they said one to another, ‘What is this?’ for they knew not what it was. And Moses said unto them, ‘This bread, which the Lord hath given us to eat, is this word, which the Lord hath prescribed’ “(Exod. xvi. 13 ff.). You see of what sort the soul’s food is. </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="170"><p>It is a word of God, continuous, resembling dew, embracing all the soul and leaving no portion without part in itself. But not everywhere does this word show itself, but on the wilderness of passions and wickednesses, and it is fine and delicate both to conceive and be conceived, and surpassingly clear and transparent to behold, and it is as it were coriander seed. Tillers of the soil say that if you cut a coriander seed and divide it into countless pieces, each of the portions into which you cut it, if sown, grows exactly as the whole seed could have done. Such too is the word of God, able to confer benefits both as a whole and by means of every part, yes any part you light upon. </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="171"><p>  It is possible that a

  of the eye, is also intended. For as the pupil of the eye is a very small part of it and sees the zones of the universe in their completeness,

<pb n="417"/>

and the boundless ocean, and the vast expanse of air and of the infinite heaven, all that is bounded by the rising and the setting sun, so the word of God also has keenest sight, and is able to survey all things, . . . wherewith they shall clearly see all that is worth beholding. Accordingly it is also white; for what could be brighter or more far-shining
than the divine word, by communion with which even other things dispel their mist and their gloom, eagerly desiring to become sharers in the light of the soul?
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="172"><p> <milestone unit="altchapter" n="60"/> An affection peculiar to it is produced by this word. When it has summoned the soul to itself, it brings about a congealment in all that part of us that is earthly, bodily, sense-bound; and this accounts for the words “as it were hoar-frost on the earth”
(Exod. xvi. 14). For we also find that when he that sees God is studying flight from the passions, the waves become fixed as if frozen, that is to say the rush and growth and vainglory of the passions; “for the waves became solid in the midst of the sea “(Exod. xv. 8), in order that he that seeth Him that is might pass beyond passion. </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="173"><p>The souls, therefore, that have indeed already had experience of the word, but are not able to answer the question, inquire one of another “What is it?” (Exod. xvi. 15). For it often happens that on finding a sweet taste in our mouths we are uncertain as to the flavour which has given rise to it, and that when we catch the scent of pleasant odours we do not know what they are. In the same way then the soul, when it has been gladdened, is often unable to say what the thing that gladdens it is. But it is taught by the hierophant and prophet Moses: he will tell it, This

bread (<hi rend="italic">ibid</hi>.) is the food which God hath given to the soul, for it to feed on His own utterance and His own word; for this bread, which He hath given us to eat, is “this word.”
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="174"><p> <milestone unit="altchapter" n="61"/> He says in Deuteronomy also: “And He afflicted thee and made thee weak by hunger, and fed thee with manna, which thy fathers knew not, that He might proclaim to thee, that not on bread alone shall man live, but on every word that goeth forth through the mouth of God “(Deut. viii. 3). This afflicting is propitiation; for on the tenth day also by afflicting our souls He makes propitiation (Lev. xvi. 30). For when we are being deprived of pleasant things, we think we are being afflicted, but in reality thereby we have God propitious to us. </p></div>

This word “the fathers knew not.” This does not mean the real forefathers, but those whose hair was grey from age who said, “Let us appoint a leader and let us return to Egypt,”
that is, “to passion” (Numb. xiv. 4). </p></div>

both by all the word and by a part of it; for the mouth is a symbol of utterance or speech, and the statement
<note n="1.421.a">Or “verb.”</note>
  is a part of speech. The soul of the most perfect is fed by the word as a whole; we may well be content should we be fed even by a portion of it.
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="177"><p> <milestone unit="altchapter" n="62"/> Now those of whom we have been speaking pray to be fed with the word of God. But Jacob, looking even higher than the word, says that he is fed by God Himself. He speaks on this wise: “The God to Whom my fathers Abraham and Isaac were well-pleasing, the God Who feedeth me from my youth up unto this day, the Angel who delivereth me out of all my ills, bless these boys” (Gen. xlviii. 15 f.). How beautiful is his tone and temper! He looks on God as feeding him, not His Word; but the Angel, who is the Word, as healer of ills. This is the language of a true philosopher. He thinks it meet and right that He that is should Himself in His own Person give the principal boons, while His Angels and Words give the secondary gifts; and secondary are such as involve riddance from ills. </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="178"><p>For this reason, I think, God bestows health in the simplest sense, preceded by no illness in our bodies, by Himself only, but health that comes by way of escape from illness He bestows both through medical science and through the physician’s skill, letting both knowledge and practitioner enjoy the credit of healing, though it is He Himself that heals alike by these means and without them. Now His mode of dealing is the same in the case of the soul. The good things, the food, He Himself bestows with His own hand, but by the agency of Angels and Words such as involve riddance of ills.

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="179"><p> <milestone unit="altchapter" n="63"/> In offering this prayer Jacob passed a censure on Joseph the statesman, who had ventured to say “I will nourish thee there.“ His words were, “Make haste and go up to my father and say to him “thus saith’ “and so op, and then “come down to me and tarry not,” finishing with “and I will nourish thee there, for there shall be famine for five years” (Gen. xlv. 9, 11). </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="180"><p>So Jacob at once chides and instructs the man wise in his own conceit when he says: “You must know, fine Sir, that the foods which nourish the soul are various forms of knowledge, and that these are not bestowed by the word of bodily sense but by God. He who reared me from youth and early prime to full-grown manhood (cf. Gen. xlviii. 15) will Himself satisfy my needs.”
Joseph therefore went through the same experience as his mother Rachel. She too imagined that a created being has some power, for she says “Give me children “(Gen. xxx. 1). But the Supplanter will find fault with her and say, ‘Thou hast greatly erred, for I am not in the place of God, who alone hath power to open the wombs of souls, and to sow virtues in them, and to make them pregnant with noble things, and to give birth to them. Take note of Leah thy sister, and thou wilt find her receiving seed and offspring out of no created being but by God’s own gift’; “for the Lord, when he saw that Leah was hated, opened her womb, but Rachel was barren” (Gen. xxix. 31). </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="181"><p> But note again
the delicate subtilty here. God opens the wombs of virtue, sowing in them noble doings, but the womb, after receiving virtue at God’s hand, does not bear to God—for He that is is in need of no one—but bears sons to me Jacob; for it may well be that it

<pb n="425"/>

was for my sake, not for His own sake that God sowed seed in virtue. Accordingly One is found to be husband to Leah, who is passed over in silence, and another to be father of the children born of Leah. For He that openeth the womb is husband, but father of the children is he to whom she is said to bear these.

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="182"><p> <milestone unit="altchapter" n="64"/> “And I will put enmity between thee and the woman “(Gen. iii. 15). In reality pleasure is a foe to sense, albeit thought by some to be a close friend. But just as no one would call the flatterer a comrade, since flattery is friendship diseased, and no one would say that the courtesan is kindly to her lover, since her tenderness is not for him but for his presents, so when you put pleasure to the test you will find that she is disguised under a counterfeit semblance of friendship with sense.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="183"><p> You know how when we have surfeited ourselves with pleasure, our organs of sense relax their vigour. Or do you not observe men intoxicated with wine or love, how seeing they do not see and hearing they do not hear and how they are deprived of the power to exercise their other senses with any precision? It sometimes happens that owing to much overeating the vigour of all the senses is relaxed as sleep overtakes the man. Indeed sleep got its name from this relaxing
<note n="1.425.a">Philo connects ὕφεσις (“relaxing”) with ὕπνος (“sleep”).</note>
  of the senses. For at such a time the organ of perception grows slack, just as when we wake up its intensity is heightened, and the impressions which we receive from without are no longer dull, but are clear and ringing, and carry the sound all the way to the mind; for the mind has to become cognizant of what is without by receiving a blow, and so to gain

<pb n="427"/>

a vivid impression of it.
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="184"><p><milestone unit="altchapter" n="65"/> Observe
that the words are not “I will set enmity for thee and the woman,” but “between thee and the woman.” Now why is it put so? Because it is over that which is <hi rend="italic">between</hi> pleasure and sense, over that which lies in their boundary so to speak, that the warfare of these two arises. But what is between them both are drinkables, eatables, what is adapted to all such purposes, each one of them being both an object of sense and a thing productive of pleasure. When pleasure, therefore, has indulged immoderately in these, it forthwith inflicts injury on sense. </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="185"><p>The expression again “between thy seed and her seed”
is full of philosophical truth: for every seed is a starting-point of existence, but the starting-point of pleasure is passion, an irrational impulse, that of sense the mind; for from the mind as from a fountain the faculties of sense flow forth and extend. This is certainly taught by Moses, the holy prophet, who says that the woman was fashioned out of Adam, sense (that is) out of mind. What pleasure, then, is to sense, that passion is to mind. Since, therefore, the former pair are mutually hostile, the latter must also be at war with each other.
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="186"><p> <milestone unit="altchapter" n="66"/> And their warfare is patent. When mind is victorious, devoting itself to immaterial things its proper object, passion quits the scene: and on the other hand, when passion has won an evil victory, mind gives in, being prevented from giving heed to itself and to all its own occupations. Moses elsewhere says, “Whenever Moses lifted up his hands, Israel prevailed, but when he dropped them, Amalek prevailed “(Exod. xvii. 11), showing that when the mind lifts itself up away from mortal things and is

<pb n="429"/>

borne aloft, that which sees God, which is Israel, gains strength, but when it has lowered its special powers and grown weak, immediately passion, named
“Amalek,” which means “a people licking out,”
will become strong: for in very deed it eats up the whole soul and licks it out, leaving behind in it no seed or spark of virtue. </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="187"><p>In keeping with this are the words “Amalek the first of the nations” (Numb, xxiv. 20), because passion rules and lords it over promiscuous hordes that have drifted together without purpose or meaning.

Moreover, the very words of God are oaths and laws of God and most sacred ordinances; and a proof of His sure strength is that whatever He saith cometh to pass, and this is specially characteristic of an oath.

One kind is found in men who desire and long for opportunities of wrongdoing and cannot get them, and this a bad kind. Another kind is that which is seen in those who repent and are vexed over their defection in former days and cry “Hapless we, how long a time had we, as is now evident, been ill all unaware of it with the illness of folly and senselessness and unrighteousness in our conduct.” </p></div>

For the Mind, that is really an eunuch and chief cook, dealing not in the simple pleasures only but in excessive ones also, deserves the title of eunuch as one who is incapable of begetting wisdom, seeing that he serves as eunuch none other than Pharaoh, the disperser of noble things. For you must bear in mind that from another point of view to become an eunuch would be a very good thing, if so our soul should be able to escape wickedness and unlearn passion. </p></div>

For at an earlier time, when he had not yet become perfect but, before his name had been changed, was still only inquiring into supramundane things, being aware that he could not beget seed out of perfect virtue, she advises him to beget children out of the handmaiden, that is school-learning, even Hagar (Gen. xvi. 2 ff.).

are equivalent to “thou didst consent to wickedness, which it is thy duty to keep off with all thy might”: because of this “cursed”—not “art thou” but “is the earth in thy works” (Gen. iii. 17).

“thou shalt sorrowfully get the benefit of being alive.” For in pain does the bad man all his life long avail himself of his own vitality. He has no motive for joy. Such a motive is in the nature of things supplied by righteousness and good sense and the virtues that share her throne.

For this is what is said: “If a fire break out and find thorns and go on to burn threshing-floor or standing corn or field; he that kindled the fire shall make restitution” (Exod. xxii. 6). </p></div>

Virtue he likens to the contents of the threshing-floor, for as the grain has been gathered together on it, so in the soul of the wise man have been gathered noble things. To the standing corn he likens gradual advance, since either is incomplete and is earnestly set on its completeness. He likens goodness of natural disposition to the field, because it is receptive of the seeds of virtue. </p></div>

Grass is food of an irrational creature; and such is a bad man with the right principle cut out of him; irrational also are the senses, being a part of the soul. But the mind striving to attain the objects of sense by means of the irrational senses, makes this striving not without toil and sweat.

For, having forsaken the wisdom of heaven, is he not now ranked with things earthly and chaotic? How then he turns back yet further, we have to consider.
