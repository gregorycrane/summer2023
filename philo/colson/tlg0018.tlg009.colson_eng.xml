<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="2"><p>
<milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="1"/> “And Noah began to be a husbandman, and he 1 planted a vineyard, and drank of the wine, and became drunken within his house
<note n="3.109.a">The LXX has ἐμεθύσθη καὶ ἐγυμνώθη ἐν τῷ οἴκῳ αὐτοῦ.</note>
 ” (Gen. ix. 20 f.).
<milestone unit="para"/>Most men, not knowing the nature of things, necessarily go wrong also in giving them names. For things which are well considered and subjected as it were to dissection have appropriate designations attached to them in consequence; while others having been presented in a confused state receive names that are not thoroughly accurate.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="2"><p> Moses, being abundantly


equipped with the knowledge that has to do with things, is in the habit of using names that are perfectly apt and expressive. We shall find the assurance just given made good in many parts of the Lawgiving, and not least in the section before us in which the righteous Noah is introduced as a husbandman.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="3"><p> Would not anyone who answers questions offhand


think that husbandry and working on the soil were the same things, although in reality they not only are not the same things, but are ideas utterly at variance with each other and mutually repugnant?</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="4"><p> For a man is able even without knowledge to labour

at the care of the soil, but a husbandman is guaranteed to be no unprofessional, but a skilled worker by his very name, which he has gained from the science of husbandry, the science whose title he bears.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="5"><p> In



<pb n="111"/>

addition to this there is the further point to be considered, that the worker on the soil is as a rule a wage-earner, and as such has but one end in view, his wages, and cares nothing at all about doing his work well; whereas the husbandman would be willing not only to put into the undertaking much of his private property, but to spend a further amount drawn from his domestic budget, to do the farm good and to escape being blamed by those who have seen it. For, regardless of gain from any other source, he desires only to see the crops which he has grown yielding plentifully year by year and to take up their produce.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="6"><p> Such a man will be anxious to bring under

cultivation the trees that were before wild, to improve by careful treatment those already under cultivation, to check by pruning those that are over-luxuriant owing to excess of nourishment, to give more scope to those which have been curtailed and kept back, splicing on new growths to stem or branch; when trees of good kinds throw out abundant tendrils, he will like to train them under ground in shallow trenches; and to improve such as yield poor crops by inserting grafts into the stem near the roots and joining them with it so that they grow together as one. The same thing happens, I may remark, in the case of men, when adopted sons become by reason of their native good qualities congenial to those who by birth are aliens from them, and so become firmly fitted into the family. To return to our subject.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="7"><p> The

husbandman will pull up by the roots and throw away quantities of trees on which the shoots that should bear fruit have lost their fertility, and so, because they have been planted near them, have done great harm to those that are bearing fruit. The science,

<pb n="113"/>

then, that has to do with growths that spring out of the earth is of the kind I have described. Let us consider in its turn soul-husbandry.

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="8"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="2"/> First, then, it makes it its aim to sow or plant

nothing that has no produce, but all that is fitted for cultivation and fruit-bearing, and likely to yield yearly tributes to man, its prince; for him did nature appoint to be ruler of all trees as well as of the living creatures besides himself that are mortal.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="9"><p> But who else could the man that is in each of us be

save the mind, whose place it is to reap the benefits derived from all that has been sown or planted? But seeing that for babes milk is food, but for grown men wheaten bread, there must also be soul-nourishment, such as is milk-like suited to the time of childhood, in the shape of the preliminary stages of school-learning, and such as is adapted to grown men in the shape of instructions leading the way through wisdom and temperance and all virtue. For these when sown and planted in the mind will produce most beneficial fruits, namely fair and praiseworthy conduct.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="10"><p> By means of this husbandry whatever trees

of passions or vices have sprung up and grown tall, bearing mischief-dealing fruits, are cut down and cleared away, no minute portion even being allowed to survive, as the germ of new growths of sins to spring up later on.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="11"><p> And should there be any trees

capable of bearing neither wholesome nor harmful fruits, these it will cut down indeed, but not allow them to be made away with, but assign them to a use for which they are suited, setting them as pales and stakes to surround an encampment or to fence in a city in place of a wall.

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="12"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="3"/> For he says, “Every

tree whose fruit is not edible thou shalt cut down and

<pb n="115"/>

shalt make into a palisade to resist the city, which shall make war against thee” (Deut. xx. 20). The Scripture uses these trees to represent the purely intellectual activities which deal with theory alone.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="13"><p> Among these we must place medical science dissociated

from practical measures such as lead to the recovery of the sick; the kind of oratory practised by the hired advocate, that is concerned not to find out the rights of the case, but to influence the hearers by falsehood; and over and above these we must include all the modes of reaching conclusions by argumentative and rigidly deductive processes,
<note n="3.115.a">“The modes . . . processes,” lit. “dialectic and geometry” (or “logic and mathematics”).</note>
  that contribute nothing to the improvement of character,
<note n="3.115.b">See App. p. 490.</note>
  but whet the mind, compelling it to pay keen attention to each problem as it presents itself; and enabling it to draw clear distinctions, and to make the special character of the matter in hand stand out in bold relief against the background of the features which it has in common with others.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="14"><p> Accordingly, they tell

us that the men of old likened philosophic discussion with its threefold division
<note n="3.115.b">See App. p. 490.</note>
  to a field, comparing that part which deals with nature to trees and plants; that which deals with morality to fruits and crops, for the sake of which the plants exist; that part which has to do with logic to a fence enclosing it.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="15"><p> For even as the wall built round it serves to protect

the fruit and the plants that grow in the field, keeping off those who would like mischievously to make their way in with a view to plunder; in the same way the logical part of philosophy is, so to speak, a strong barrier guarding those other two parts, the ethical and the physical.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="16"><p> For when it disentangles ambiguous

expressions capable of two meanings, and exposes the fallacies created by tricks of argument, and using

<pb n="117"/>

perfectly clear and unmistakable language and adducing proofs which admit of no doubt destroys plausible falsehood, that greatest snare and pest of the soul, it makes the mind like smoothed wax ready to receive the impressions made by the science that explores existence and that which aims at building character, impressions free from flaw and aught that is not genuine.

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="17"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="4"/> These, then, are the offers held out by soul-husbandry

in its inaugural proclamation: “The trees of folly and licentiousness, of injustice and cowardice I will wholly cut down; I will moreover extirpate the plants of pleasure and desire, of anger and wrath and of like passions, even though they be grown up to heaven; I will burn up their very roots, letting the rush of fire pursue them even to the depths of the earth, that no part or trace or shadow of them whatever be left behind.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="18"><p> These I will destroy, but

I will plant for souls in their childhood suckers whose fruit shall feed them. These suckers are the learning to write easily and read fluently; the diligent search of what wise poets have written; geometry and the practice of rhetorical composition; and the whole of the education embraced in school-learning. For souls at the stage of youths and of those now growing into men I will provide the better and more perfect thing suited to their age, the plant of sound sense, that of courage, that of temperance, that of justice, that of all virtue.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="19"><p> If, again, some tree among those

that belong to what is called wild wood does not bear edible fruit, but can be a fence and protection of such fruit, this tree also will I keep in store, not for its own sake, but because it is adapted to do service to another that is indispensable and most useful.”

<pb n="119"/>

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="20"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="5"/> It is for this reason that Moses, the all-wise,

ascribes to the righteous man soul-husbandry as a science in keeping with him and rightly pertaining to him, saying “Noah began to be a husbandman,”
whereas to the unrighteous man he ascribes that working of the ground which is without scientific knowledge and carries very heavy loads.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="21"><p> For he

says, “Cain was one working the ground” (Gen. iv. 2), and, a little later, when he is discovered to have incurred
<note n="3.119.a">Or “earned from his working.” Philo plays with ἐργάζομαι which can mean either “to work” (till) or “gain by work.” So, too, ἄγος (pollution) carries with it the idea of a curse and explains the ἐπικατάρατος of the text.</note>
  the pollution of fratricide, it is said: “Cursed art thou from the ground, which hath opened her mouth to receive thy brother’s blood from thy hand, with which thou shalt work the ground, and it shall not yield
<note n="3.119.b">Or “add.” <hi rend="italic">Cf. Quod Det.</hi> 112.</note>
  its strength to give it thee” (Gen. iv. 12 f.).</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="22"><p> How, I ask, could anyone shew more clearly

than in this manner that the lawgiver considers the bad man a worker of the soil and not an husbandman? We must not, however, suppose that what is here spoken of is either a man able to work with hands and feet and the other powers of the body, or that it is soil on hill or plain. No, the subject dealt with is the faculties of each one of us; for the soul of the bad man has no other interest than his earthy body, and all the body’s pleasures.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="23"><p> At all events

the majority of mankind traversing all the quarters of the earth and finding their way to its utmost bounds, and crossing its oceans, and seeking what is hidden in far-reaching creeks of the sea, and leaving no part of the whole world unexplored, are always and everywhere procuring the means of increasing pleasure.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="24"><p> For even as fishermen let down nets,

sometimes very long, taking in a large extent of sea,


<pb n="121"/>

in order that they may enclose within the toils as many fish as possible imprisoned as though by a wall: in just the same fashion the larger part of mankind stretching what the poets call, I think, “all-capturing
nets,” not only over every part of the sea but over the whole realm of water, earth and air, ensnares from all quarters things of all sorts to satisfy and indulge Pleasure.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="25"><p> They dig into the ground and

cross the seas and do all works incidental to war or peace to provide lavish materials for Pleasure as for a queen. These people have not learned the secrets of soul-husbandry, which sows and plants the virtues and reaps as their fruit a happy life. They have made the objects dear to the flesh their business,
<note n="3.121.a">Or “their work,” still continuing the thought of γῆς ἐργασία.</note>
  and these they pursue methodically. With all earnestness they seek to make their own that composition of clay, that moulded statue, that house so close to the soul, which it never lays aside but carries as a corpse from birth to death, ah! how sore a burden!

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="26"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="6"/> We have stated how working of the soil differs

from husbandry and a worker of the soil from an husbandman. But we must consider whether there are not other cases like those which have been mentioned, in which the difference between the things signified is obscured by their passing under the same name. There are two such instances which we have found by careful search, and concerning which we will say, if we can, what ought to be said.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="27"><p> For example, then, as in the case of “husbandman”

and “soil-worker,” by resorting to allegory we found a wide difference in meaning to underly apparent


<pb n="123"/>

identity, so shall we find it to be with “shepherd”
and “cattle-rearer.”</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="28"><p> For the lawgiver speaks in some places of “cattle-rearing,” in others of “shepherding,” and people who have not acquired real

accuracy will perhaps suppose that these are synonymous descriptions of the same pursuit, whereas they denote different things when words are rendered in the light of their deeper meaning.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="29"><p> For though it is

customary to apply to those who have charge of animals both names, calling them “cattle-rearers” and “shepherds” indiscriminately, yet we may not do so when we are speaking of the reasoning faculty to which the flock of the soul has been entrusted: for this ruler of a flock is called a “cattle-rearer” when he is a bad ruler, but, when a good and sterling one, he receives the name of “shepherd.” How this is, we will at once shew.

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="30"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="7"/> Nature has produced

each one of us with “cattle” as part of our being. The living soul puts forth, as it were, from one root two shoots, one of which has been left whole and undivided and is called “Mind,” while the other by a sixfold division is made into seven growths, five those of the senses and (two) of two other organs, that of utterance and that of generation.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="31"><p>
<note n="3.123.a"><hi rend="italic">Cf. De Op.</hi> 117 and note.</note>
  All this

herd being irrational is compared to cattle, and by nature’s law a herd cannot do without a governor. Now when a man at once without experience in ruling and possessed of wealth rises up and constitutes himself a ruler, he becomes the author of a multitude of evils to his charges.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="32"><p> For he on his

part supplies provender lavishly, and the animals gorging themselves beyond measure wax wanton from abundance of food, wantonness being the true offspring of excess, and in their wantonness they

<pb n="125"/>

become frolicsome and refuse to be controlled, and getting separated in scattered groups they break up the compact array of the flock.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="33"><p> The erstwhile

ruler, forsaken by his subjects, is shewn to be a raw hand, and runs after them anxious if possible to get hold of some animal and bring it under control again. Finding that he cannot do this, he weeps and groans, cursing his own rashness, and blaming himself for what has happened.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="34"><p> Precisely in this way does that

other herd, our senses, act; whenever the mind gets lazy and careless, they gorge themselves insatiably with the lavish food brought in by the objects of sense, shake off restraint, and get unruly, going at random where they have no business to go. The eyes wide open to all things visible, even those which it is not right to look upon, meet with disaster. The ears welcome all sounds and are never satisfied; they are athirst all the time for particulars about other people’s business, in some cases for topics for vulgar jesting, and go far and wide on these errands.

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="35"><p><milestone unit="para"/>VIII, From

what other quarter can we suppose that the theatres all over the world are filled every day with countless myriads? Those whom spectacles and musical performances have made their slaves, allowing ears and eyes to wander about unbridled; taken up with flute-players and harpers and the whole range of unmanly and effeminate music; delighting in dancers and other actors, because they put themselves into indelicate positions and make indelicate movements; ever organizing a warfare as mimic as that on the stage
<note n="3.125.a">Or “actively promoting the warfare of the stage,”i.e. encouraging by their partisanship the rivalries and intrigues of the actors. Mangey “factiones theatricas instaurant.” Philo frequently uses συγκροτέω with πόλεμον in the sense of “organize” or “wage”; otherwise it might be taken as=“applaud.”</note>
  without a thought for their own betterment or


<pb n="127"/>

for that of the commonweal, but overthrowing (the poor wretches!), by means of eyes and ears their own life itself.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="36"><p> Others there are more miserable

and ill-starred than these, who have let loose their appetite like an animal which had been tied up. Thus left at large it at once makes for all kinds of enjoyment of eatables and drinkables, takes its pick of what has already been served up, and develops a ceaseless and insatiable craving for what is not on the table. So, even if the receptacles of the belly have been completely filled, taste still empty and still swelling and panting goes about looking everywhere to see whether haply there are any leavings that have been overlooked and let pass, that like an all-devouring fire it may pick up this as well.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="37"><p> Gluttony

is naturally followed by her attendant, sexual indulgence, bringing on extraordinary madness, fierce desire and most grievous frenzy. For when men have been loaded up with overeating and strong drink and heavy intoxication, they are no longer able to control themselves, but in haste to indulge their lusts they carry on their revels and beset doors until they have drained off the great vehemence of their passion and find it possible to be still.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="38"><p> This is

apparently the reason why Nature placed the organs of sexual lust where she did, assuming that they do not like hunger, but are roused to their special activities when fulness of food leads the way.

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="39"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="9"/> So we must give the name of cattle-rearers to

those who permit these creatures to gorge themselves wholesale with all that they crave after. The title of shepherds we must give on the other hand to such as supply them with the necessaries of life only and nothing more, pruning and cutting off all excessive

<pb n="129"/>

and hurtful luxuriance, a thing which does no less harm than straitness and dearth. “Shepherds” too are those who exercise much forethought that the flock may not contract disease as the result of negligence and laziness, praying too that there may be no occurrence of such plagues as are wont to come as a visitation which cannot be guarded against.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="40"><p> No less

do they make it their aim that the flock may not be broken up and scattered about. Fear is the corrector of those who never obey reason. This they hold over them, and have recourse to constant punishment, a mild form in the case of those whose rebellion is capable of being cured, but very severe in the case of those whose wrongdoings defy curative treatment. For that which is apparently much to be deprecated is a very great boon to people who act senselessly, just as physic is to people in bad bodily health.

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="41"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="10"/> These are the practices and ways of shepherds,

who prefer what is distasteful but beneficial to what is pleasant but hurtful. So full of dignity and benefit has the shepherd’s task been held to be, that poets are wont to give to kings the title of “shepherds of peoples,” a title which the lawgiver bestows on the wise. They are the only real kings,
<note n="3.129.a">See App. p. 490.</note>
  and he shews them to us ruling, as a shepherd does his flock, over the irrational tendency common to all mankind.
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="42"><p><milestone unit="para"/>This is why he ascribed to Jacob, who was perfected

as the result of discipline, the shepherd’s lore. For Jacob tends the sheep of Laban (Gen. xxx. 36), that is to say, of the soul of the foolish one which considers nothing good but sensible objects that meet the eye, and which is deceived and enslaved by colours and shadows; for the meaning of “Laban” is “whitening.”</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="43"><p> He ascribes the same profession to Moses, the



<pb n="131"/>

all-wise; for he also is appointed shepherd of a mind that welcomes conceit in preference to truth, and approves seeming in preference to being. For “Jethro” or “Iothor” means “uneven,
<note n="3.131.a">See App. p. 490.</note>
 ” and self-conceit is an uneven and adventitious thing that comes in to beguile a fixed and steady life. It is a quality whose way is to introduce principles of right varying city by city; of one kind in this city, of another kind in that; not the same rule of right in all. The ordinances of nature that apply to all alike and are immovable it has never seen even in a dream. What we are told is that “Moses was shepherding the sheep of Jethro the priest of Midian” (Exod. iii.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="44"><p> 1). This same Moses prays that the whole multitude

of the soul-folk may not be left as an untended flock, but may be given a good shepherd, leading them forth away from the snares of folly and injustice and all wickedness, and leading them in to imbibe all that discipline and virtue in its other forms would teach them. For he says, “Let the Lord, the God of the spirits and of all flesh, appoint a man over this congregation;” then, after adding a few words, he continues, “And the congregation of the Lord shall not be as sheep that have no shepherd” (Numb. xxvii. 16 f.).

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="45"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="11"/> Is it not well to pray that the flock linked

to each one of us by a common birth and a common growth may not be left without a ruler and guide? So might mob-rule, the very worst of bad constitutions, the counterfeit of democracy, which is the best of them, infect us, while we spend our days in ceaseless experience of disorders, tumults and intestine broils.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="46"><p> Anarchy, however, the mother of mob-rule, is not our

only danger. We have to dread also the uprising of some aspirant to sovereign power, forcibly setting law

<pb n="133"/>

at naught. For a tyrant is a natural enemy. In cities this enemy is man; to body and soul and all the interests of each of these, it is an utterly savage mind, that has turned our inner citadel into a fortress from which to assail us.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="47"><p> Nor is it only from these

tyrannies that we derive no benefit. We gain nothing from the rule and governance of men who are too good and gentle. For kindness is a quality open to contempt, and injurious to both sides, both rulers and subjects. The former, owing to the slight esteem in which they are held by those placed under their authority, are powerless to set right anything that is wrong either with individual citizens or with the commonwealth. In some instances they are actually compelled to abdicate. Their subjects, as the result of habitual contempt for their rulers, have come to disregard their moral suasion, and undeterred by fear, have, at the cost of incurring a great evil, made the acquisition of stubbornness.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="48"><p> These, therefore, we

must regard as differing in no respect from cattle, nor their rulers from cattle-rearers. The latter induce them to luxuriate in abundance of material comforts; the former, powerless to bear the overfeeding, wax wanton. But our mind ought to rule as a goat-herd, or a cow-herd, or a shepherd, or, to use a general term, as a herdsman, as one who chooses both for himself and the creatures he tends what is advantageous in preference to what is agreeable.

parts of the soul are not left to drift with no one to watch over them, is, we may say, mainly, nay solely, God’s care and oversight. It secures for the soul the benefit of a blameless and perfectly good shepherd. When He has been set over it there is no possibility

<pb n="135"/>

of the union of the mind’s parts being dissolved. For, having been brought under one and the same direction, it will evidently have to look only to the guidance of a single chief. For to be compelled to give heed to many authorities is a very heavy burden.
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="50"><p><milestone unit="para"/>Indeed, so good a thing is shepherding that it is

justly ascribed not to kings only and wise men and perfectly cleansed souls but also to God the All-Sovereign.
The authority for this ascription is not any ordinary one but a prophet, whom we do well to trust. </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="51"><p><milestone unit="para"/>This is the way in which the Psalmist speaks:
“The Lord shepherds me and nothing shall be lacking to me” (Ps. xxiii, 1). It well befits every lover of

God to rehearse this Psalm. But for the Universe it is a still more fitting theme. For land and water and air and fire, and all plants and animals which are in these, whether mortal or divine, yea and the sky, and the circuits of sun and moon, and the revolutions and rhythmic movements of the other heavenly bodies, are like some flock under the hand of God its King and Shepherd. This hallowed flock He leads in accordance with right and law, setting over it His true Word and Firstborn Son Who shall take upon Him its government like some viceroy of a great king; for it is said in a certain place: “Behold I AM, I send My Angel before thy face to guard thee in the way”
(Exod. xxiii.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="52"><p> 20). Let therefore even the whole

universe, that greatest and most perfect flock of the God who IS, say, “The Lord shepherds me, and nothing shall fail me.”</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="53"><p> Let each individual person

too utter this same cry, not with the voice that glides forth over tongue and lips, not reaching beyond a short space of air, but with the voice of the understanding that has wide scope and lays hold on the

<pb n="137"/>

ends of the universe. For it cannot be that there should be any lack of a fitting portion, when God rules, whose wont it is to bestow good in fullness and perfection on all that is.,

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="54"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="13"/> Magnificent is the

call to holiness sounded by the psalm just quoted; for the man is poor and incomplete in very deed, who, while seeming to have all things else, chafes at the sovereignty of One; whereas the soul that is shepherded of God, having the one and only thing on which all depend, is naturally exempt from want of other things, for it worships no blind wealth, but a wealth that sees and that with vision surpassingly keen.
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="55"><p><milestone unit="para"/>An intense and unquenchable love for this wealth

was entertained by all who belonged to its school, and this made them laugh cattle-rearing to scorn and spend labour on the lore of shepherding. The history of Joseph affords proof of this.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="56"><p> Joseph, always having

as the object of his thought and aim the rule of life based on the body and on the surmises of vain imagination, does not know how to govern and direct irrational natures. To offices such as this which are subject to no higher control older men are generally called; but he is always a young man, even if he have attained the old age that comes on us by mere lapse of time. Being accustomed to feed and fatten irrational natures instead of ruling them, he imagines that he will be able to win the lovers of virtue also to change over to his side in order that, devoting themselves to irrational and soulless creatures, they may no longer be able to find time for the pursuits of a rational soul.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="57"><p> For he says, “If that Mind, whose realm is the body,

inquire what your work is, tell him in reply, We are cattle-rearers” (Gen. xlvi. 33 f.). On hearing this

<pb n="139"/>

they are vexed, as we might expect, that, being rulers, they are to admit that they occupy the position of subjects;</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="58"><p> for those, who prepare food for the senses

by means of the lavish abundance of sensible objects, become slaves of those whom they feed, compelled day by day, like household servants to mistresses, to render the appointed due; whereas the place of rulers is held by those who exercise authority over the senses, and check their excessive impulse to greed.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="59"><p> At first his brethren, though far from pleased at

hearing what was said to them, will hold their peace, deeming it superfluous trouble to set forth to those who will not learn the difference between cattle-feeding
and shepherding; but afterwards when the contest regarding these matters is upon them, they will engage in it with all their might, and, until they have carried the day, they will never relax their efforts to make manifest the free and noble and truly princely character that pertains to their nature. When the king asks them “What is your work?”
they answer “We are shepherds, as were our fathers”
(Gen. xlvii. 3).

<milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="14"/> Aye indeed!</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="60"><p> Does it not seem

as though they were more proud of being shepherds than is the king, who is talking to them, of all his sovereign power? They proclaim that not they only but their fathers also deliberately chose this course of life as worthy of entire and enthusiastic devotion.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="61"><p> And yet, if the care of literal goats or sheep was what

was meant, they would perhaps, in their shrinking from disgrace, have been actually ashamed to own what they were; for such pursuits are held mean and inglorious in the eyes of those who have compassed that importance, wholly devoid of wisdom, that comes with prosperity, and most of all in the eyes of monarchs.

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="62"><p>The spirit of the Egyptians too is by nature

arrogant even beyond that of other men, whenever a feeble breath only of good fortune has blown over it, and this arrogance makes them treat the aims in life and the ambitions of more common people as matter for rude jesting and loud ridicule.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="63"><p> But seeing

that the subject propounded for consideration is that of the rational and irrational faculties in the soul, those will have ground for boasting who are convinced that they are able by employing the rational faculties as their allies to get the better of those which are irrational.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="64"><p> If, however, some malignant and contentious

person find fault with them and say, “How is it, then, that, devoting your labour to the science of shepherding, and professing to bestow the care of leaders on the flock that lives and grows with your life and growth, you conceived the idea of coming to anchor in Egypt, the land of the body and the passions, instead of voyaging to some different port?”—we may confidently say to him “We came to sojourn (Gen. xlvii.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="65"><p> 4)—not to settle there”; for in

reality a wise man’s soul ever finds heaven to be his fatherland and earth a foreign country, and regards as his own the dwelling-place of wisdom, and that of the body as outlandish, and looks on himself as a stranger and sojourner in it.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="66"><p> Accordingly when

Mind, the ruler of the flock, taking the flock of the soul in hand with the law of Nature as his instructor shews it the way with vigorous leadership, he renders it well worthy of praise and approval, even as he subjects it to blame if he disregard Nature’s law and behave slackly and carelessly. With good reason, then, will the one take on him the name of king and be hailed “shepherd,” but the other that of a sort

<pb n="143"/>

of cook or baker and be entitled “cattle-feeder,” serving up rich fare as a feast for beasts who make a habit of gluttony.

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="67"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="15"/> I have taken some pains to shew in what way

a husbandman differs from a worker on the soil, and a shepherd from a feeder of cattle. There is a third head akin to those that have been dealt with, and of it we will now speak. For the lawgiver holds that a horseman differs greatly from a rider, not only when each is a man seated on a neighing animal but when each is a process of reasoning. Well then, he who being without skill in horsemanship is on a horse’s back is naturally called a rider.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="68"><p>
<note n="3.143.a">Or “mounted man.”</note>
  He has given himself

over to an irrational and capricious beast, the consequence being that, wherever the creature goes, thither he must of absolute necessity be carried, and that the animal, not having caught sight in time of an opening in the ground or of some deep trench, is hurled headlong owing to the violence of his pace, and his rider
<note n="3.143.b">Or “the man mounted on him.”</note>
  is borne to destruction with him.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="69"><p> The

horseman, on the other hand, when he is about to mount, puts the bit in the horse’s mouth and then as he leaps on its back, seizes hold of its mane, and, though seeming to be borne along, himself in actual fact leads, as a pilot does, the creature that is carrying him. For the pilot also, while seeming to be led by the ship which he is steering, in reality leads it, and convoys it to the ports which he is anxious to reach.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="70"><p> When the horse goes ahead in obedience to the rein,

the horseman strokes him as though he were praising him, but when he gets too impetuous and exceeds the suitable pace, he uses force and pulls back his head strongly, so as to lessen his speed. If he goes on being refractory, he grips the bit and pulls his whole

<pb n="145"/>

neck round the other way, so that he is forced to stop.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="71"><p> To counter rearings and constant unruliness there are

whips and spurs ready at hand and all the other contrivances with which breakers-in of colts are provided for punishing them. There is nothing to wonder at in all this, for when the horseman gets on the horse’s back, skill in horsemanship gets up with him, so that there are really two, a seated man on the horse and an expert, and they will naturally get the better of a single animal who is not only underneath them but is incapable of acquiring skill.

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="72"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="16"/> Passing then from the neighing animals and

those that ride upon them, search, if you please, your own soul; for you will find among its constituent parts both horses and one who wields the reins and one who is mounted, all just as in the outside world.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="73"><p> Desire and high spirit are horses, the one male, the

  For this reason the one prances and wants to be free and at large and has a high neck, as you might expect of a male. The other is mean and slavish, up to sly tricks, keeps her nose in the manger and empties it in no time,
<note n="3.145.b">i.e. “eats you out of house and home.” See App. p. 490.</note>
  for she is a female. The Mind is alike mounted man and wielder of the reins; a wielder of the reins, when he mounts accompanied by good sense, a mere mounted man when folly is his companion.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="74"><p> The foolish man, since he has never learnt,

cannot keep hold of the reins. They slip from his hand and drop on the ground; and straightway the animals are out of control, and their course becomes erratic and disorderly.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="75"><p> The fool behind them does

suspended turned over back-downwards, and as he is dragged along in the very wheel tracks he gets head and neck and both shoulders battered and crushed, and in the end, tossed after this fashion in every direction and knocking up against everything that comes in his way, he undergoes a most pitiable death.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="76"><p> For

him such is the end that results, but the vehicle lifting itself up and making violent springs, when it reaches the ground in its rebound, too easily becomes a wreck, so that it is quite beyond being mended and made strong again.

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="77"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="17"/> It is to be expected that the entire vehicle of

the soul with all who are on it should come to ruin in this manner, if it has gone wrong in the matter of the driving. It is a gain that such horses and those who drive them without skill should be destroyed, that the products of virtue may be exalted; for when folly has a fall, wisdom is bound to rise up.
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="78"><p><milestone unit="para"/>This is why Moses in his “hortatory discourse”
<note n="3.147.a">One of Philo’s names for Deuteronomy; cf. § 172.</note>


says: “If thou shalt go out to war against thine enemies and see horse and rider and much people, thou shalt not be afraid, because the Lord thy God is with thee”
(Deut. xx. 1). For high spirit and craving lust and all passions generally, and the whole array of reasoning faculties seated upon each of them as upon horses, even though they be held to have at their disposal resistless might, may be disregarded by those who have the power of the Great King acting always and everywhere as their shield and champion.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="79"><p> There

is a divine army consisting of the virtues who fight on behalf of souls that love God, whom it befits

<pb n="149"/>

when they see the adversary vanquished, to sing to God, gloriously triumphant and giver of victory, a hymn of beauty and wholly befitting Him. And two choirs, one from the quarters of the men, one from those of the women, with answering note and voice shall raise harmonious chant.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="80"><p> The choir of the

<note n="3.149.a">See App. p. 490.</note>
  (Exod. xv. 1, 20). For it is right with both mind and sense to render hymns and sing blessings to the Godhead without delay, and tunefully to strike each of our instruments, that of mind and that of sense perception, in thanksgiving and honour paid to the only Saviour.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="81"><p> So we find
<note n="3.149.a">See App. p. 490.</note>
  the Song by the seashore

sung by all that are men, with no blind understanding but with keenest vision, with Moses as their leader; it is sung also by the women who in the true sense are the best, having been enrolled as members of Virtue’s commonwealth, with Miriam to start their song.

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="82"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="18"/> The same hymn is sung by both

choirs, and it has a most noteworthy refrain, the recurrence of which is strikingly beautiful. It is this: “Let us sing unto the Lord, for gloriously hath He been glorified; horse and rider He threw into the sea” (Exod. xv.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="83"><p> 1, 21). No one who looks

into the matter could find a more perfect victory than one in which that most doughty array of passions and vices, four-footed, restless, boastful beyond measure, has been defeated. So it is, for vices are four in kind and passions equal to these in number.
<note n="3.149.b">The four vices are folly, cowardice, intemperance, injustice (corresponding to the four virtues). Diog. Laert. vii. 92. For the four passions, grief, fear, desire, pleasure, see <hi rend="italic">S.V.F.</hi> iii. 381 ff.</note>
  It is a victory, moreover, in which their rider has been thrown and dispatched, even virtue-hating and

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="84"><p><milestone unit="para"/>Right well therefore does the lawgiver in his

Charges
<note n="3.151.a">Another of Philo’s names for Deuteronomy.</note>
  give directions not to appoint a horse-rearer
to be a ruler, regarding as unsuited for such high authority any man who resembles an unbridled and unruly horse, and, in his wild excitement over pleasures, lusts and amours, knows no restraint. These are the lawgiver’s words, “Thou mayest not appoint over thyself a foreigner, because he is not thy brother; for the reason that he shall not multiply to himself horses, nor turn the people back into Egypt” (Deut. xvii.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="85"><p> 15 f.). According, therefore, to

Moses, that most holy man, a rearer of horses is by nature unfit to hold rule; and yet it might be urged that strength in cavalry is a great asset to a king, and not a whit less important than infantry and the naval force; nay, in many cases of greater service than these. These arms are especially important when it is requisite that the offensive should be instantaneous and vigorously pressed; when the state of affairs does not admit of delay, but is in the highest degree critical; so that those who are behindhand would fairly be considered not so much to have been slow to gain the advantage as to have failed for good and all, since the other side has been too quick for them, and gone by them like a cloud.

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="86"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="19"/> We would say in answer to these criticisms,


“My good sirs, the lawgiver is not curtailing any ruler’s garrison, nor is he incapacitating the army which he has collected by cutting off the more effective part of the force, the cavalry. He is trying

<pb n="153"/>

his best to improve it, that by an increase, both in strength and numbers, those who are righting side by side may most easily overcome their enemies.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="87"><p> For who was so capable as he, in virtue of abundant

acquaintance with these matters, to marshal an army by phalanxes and draw it up in order of battle and to appoint captains and corps-commanders and the other leaders of larger or smaller bodies of men, or to impart to those who would make a right use of it all that has been found out in the way of tactics and strategy?</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="88"><p> But the fact is that he is not talking

in this passage about a cavalry force, which a sovereign has to organize for the overthrow of an unfriendly power and for the safety of his friends. He is speaking about that irrational and unmeasured and unruly movement in the soul to check which is in her interest, lest some day it turn back all her people to Egypt, the country of the body, and forcibly render it a lover of pleasure and passion rather than of God and virtue. For he who acquires a multitude of horses cannot fail, as the lawgiver himself said, to take the road to Egypt.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="89"><p> For when the

soul is swaying and tossing like a vessel, now to the side of the mind now to that of body, owing to the violence of the passions and misdeeds that rage against her, and the billows rising mountains high sweep over her, then in all likelihood the mind becomes waterlogged and sinks; and the bottom to which it sinks is nothing else than the body, of which Egypt is the figure.

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="90"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="20"/> Never then give

your mind to this kind of horse-rearing. Blameworthy indeed are those also who make a business of it in its literal form. To be sure they are so. With them irrational beasts are of greater value than human

<pb n="155"/>

beings. From their mansions there continually come troops of well-fed horses leading the way, while of the human beings that come behind these not one can get out of them a contribution to supply his need, or a gift to provide him with some spare cash.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="91"><p> Nevertheless the wrong done by these people is less

heinous. For they contend that by training racehorses they both add lustre to the sacred race-meetings,
and to the national festivals which are held universally; that they not only give the spectators pleasure and provide them with the enjoyment of the sight, but promote the cultivation and study of noble aims; for men (they say) who behold in animals the desire to carry off the victory, find themselves filled, by reason of their love of honour and enthusiasm for excellence, with an urgency and readiness beyond words, and so readily

  submit to exertions in such contests as properly belong to them, and will not desist till they achieve their object.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="92"><p> While these people find arguments in favour of their

ill-doing, those who sin without excuse are those who take Mind, that rider who is a tyro in the science of horsemanship, and put him on the back of four-footed
vice and passion.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="93"><p> If, however, you have

been taught the art of driving, and having become fairly familiar with it by persistent practice, have come to the conclusion that you can now manage horses, mount and hold on to the reins. By this means you will escape two disasters. If the horses rear you will not fall off, get badly hurt, and incur the ridicule of malicious spectators; nor, if enemies make a rush at you from in front or from behind, will you be caught; you will be too quick for those who come from behind and outstrip their pursuit; and you will

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="94"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="21"/> Does not Moses, then, when celebrating the

destruction of the riders, naturally pray for complete salvation for the horsemen? For these are able
<note n="3.157.a">See App. p. 491.</note>
  by applying bit and bridle to the irrational faculties to curb the excessive violence of their movement. We must say, then, what his prayer is: “Let Dan,” he says, “be a serpent on the road, seated upon the track, biting the heel of the horse; and the horseman shall fall backwards, waiting for the salvation of the Lord” (Gen. xlix.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="95"><p> 17 f.). What he intimates by the

prayer, we must point out. “Dan
<note n="3.157.a">See App. p. 491.</note>
 ” means “judgement” or “sifting.” The faculty, then, which tests and investigates and determines and, in a manner, judges all the soul’s concerns, he likened to a serpent. This is a creature tortuous in its movements, of great intelligence, ready to shew fight, and most capable of defending itself against wrongful aggression. He did not liken the faculty to the serpent that played the friend and gave advice to “Life”—whom in our own language we call “Eve”—but to the serpent made by Moses out of material brass. When those who had been bittten by the venomous serpents looked upon this one, though at the point of death, they are said to have lived on and in no case to have died (Numb. xxi. 8).

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="96"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="22"/> Told in this way, these

  depending on the senses and material substance of our bodies; that her serpent is pleasure, a crawling thing with many a twist, powerless to raise itself upright, always prone, creeping after the good things of earth alone, making for the hiding-places afforded to it by the body, making its lair in each of the senses as in cavities or dug-outs, giving advice to a human being,
<note n="3.159.b">This seems strange here, notwithstanding “friend and counsellor” above, § 95. Mangey proposed ἐπίβουλον, Wend. &lt;κακὸν&gt; σύμβουλον.</note>
  athirst for the blood of anything better than itself, delighting to cause death by poisonous and painless bites. We say that the serpent of Moses is the disposition quite contrary to pleasure, even stedfast endurance, which explains why it is represented as being made of very strong material like brass.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="98"><p> He, then, who has looked with

fixed gaze on the form of patient endurance, even though he should perchance have been previously bitten by the wiles of pleasure, cannot but live; for, whereas pleasure menaces the soul with inevitable death, self-control holds out to it health and safety for life; and self-mastery, that averter of ills, is an antidote to licentiousness.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="99"><p> And the thing that is

beautiful and noble, which assuredly brings health and salvation, is dear to every wise man. So when Moses prays, either that there may be for Dan, or that Dan himself may be, a serpent (for the words may be taken either way), he prays for a serpent corresponding to the one made by him, but not like Eve’s; for prayer is an asking for good things.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="100"><p> And

we know that endurance is of a good kind that brings immortality, a perfect good, while pleasure is

of an evil kind that inflicts the greatest penalty. even death. Wherefore it says, “Let Dan become a serpent” not elsewhere than “on the road.”</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="101"><p> For

lack of self-control, and gluttony, and all else that issues from the womb of those immoderate and insatiate pleasures that ever conceive by the abundance of external comforts, never allow the soul to go along the straight course by the highway, but compel it to fall into pits and clefts, until they have utterly destroyed it. But only the practice of endurance and temperance and other virtue secures for the soul a safe journey where there is no slippery object under foot upon which the soul must stumble and be laid low. Most fitly therefore did he say that temperance keeps to the right road, since the opposite condition, that of licentiousness, finds no road at all.

you, the defeated combatant, will have won a grand victory, and those who have won will be suffering defeat.

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="115"><p> As


for the other contests, of sprinters or of those who enter for the five exercises, what sensible person would not laugh at them, at their having practised to jump as far as possible, and getting the several distances measured, and making swiftness of foot a matter of rivalry?

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="116"><p> Of these contests, in sober truth,


none is sacred, and even if all men testify to that effect, they cannot escape being convicted of false witness by themselves.

nothing sacred is censurable, but wholly of good report, it follows that the Olympic contest

For this contest those who are very weaklings in their bodies but stalwarts in their souls all enter, and proceed to strip and rub dust over them and do everything that skill and strength enables them to do, omitting nothing that can help them to victory.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="120"><p> So these athletes prevail


over their opponents, but they are also competing among themselves for the highest place. For they do not all win the victory in the same way, though all deserve honour for overthrowing and bringing down most troublesome and doughty opponents.</p></div>

among these, and, as he receives the first prizes, no one can grudge them to him. Nor let those be downcast who have been held worthy of the second or third prize. For these, like the first, are prizes offered with a view to

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="122"><p> There is, then, a very instructive purpose


in the words, “the horseman shall fall,” namely, that if a man fall off from evil things, he may get up supporting himself upon good things and be set upright.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="123"><p> Another point full of teaching is his speaking of falling not forwards, but backwards, since to be behindhand in vice and passion is always most to our advantage; for we ought to be beforehand when


doing noble deeds, but on the contrary to be tardy about doing base deeds: we should go to meet the former, but be late for the latter, and fall short of them by the greatest possible distance; for he, whose happiness it is to be late for sinful deeds and passion’s promptings, abides in freedom from soul-sickness.

all these considerations and more than these. But that no malicious critic may too daringly give rein to his inventive talent, we will leave the letter, and make one or two remarks about the inner meaning of the Law. Firstly, it considers that a man ought to concern himself not only with the acquisition of good things, but with the enjoyment of what he has acquired, and that happiness results from the practice of perfect excellence seeing that such excellence secures a life sound and complete in every way. Secondly, what the Law means is that a man’s main consideration is not house or vineyard or the wife already betrothed to him; how he is to take to wife her whom he has wooed and won; how the planter of the vineyard is to cull and crush its fruit, and then drink large draughts of the intoxicating beverage and make his heart glad; or how the man that has built the house is to occupy it; but that the faculties of a

<pb n="191"/>

man’s soul are a man’s main consideration.
<note n="3.191.a">Or the passage may be taken as follows: “The lawgiver is not speaking of house or vineyard. . . . He does not wish that he should take to wife . . . But he is speaking of the faculties of a man’s soul;” cf. for this use of ὁ λόγος αὐτῷ, “he is not speaking about,” § 88 above.</note>

Progress is seen in the work of the husbandman, for, as it is the planter’s care that the trees should grow, so is it the earnest student’s care to bring it about that the principles of sound sense shall receive the utmost development.

befits all these, the beginners, those making progress, and those who have reached perfection, to live without contention, refusing to engage in the war waged by the sophists, with their unceasing practice of quarrelsomeness and disturbance to the adulteration of the truth: for the truth is dear to peace, and peace has no liking for them.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="160"><p> If our friends <hi rend="italic">do</hi> come


into this conflict, mere unprofessionals engaging trained and seasoned fighters, they will undoubtedly get the worst of it; the beginner because he lacks experience, the man who is progressing, because he is incomplete, the man who has reached completeness, because he is still unpractised in virtue. It is requisite, just as it is that plaster should become firm and fixed and acquire solidity,
<note n="3.191.b">See App. p. 493.</note>
  so too that the



<pb n="193"/>

souls of those that have been perfected should become more firmly settled, strengthened by constant practice and continual exercise.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="161"><p> Those who do not enjoy


these advantages have the name among the philosophers of wise men unconscious of their wisdom.
<note n="3.193.a">See App. p. 493.</note>
  For they say that it is out of the question that those who have sped as far as the edge of wisdom and have just come for the first time into contact with its borders should be conscious of their own perfecting, that both things cannot come about at the same time, the arrival at the goal and the apprehension of the arrival, but that ignorance must form a border-land between the two, not that ignorance which is far removed from knowledge, but that which is close at hand and hard by her door.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="162"><p> It will, then, be the


business of him who fully apprehends and understands the subject and thoroughly knows his own powers, to go to war with the strife-loving band of sophists; for there is ground for expecting that such an one will be the conqueror. But for him whose eyes are still covered by the darkness of ignorance, the light of knowledge not being strong enough as yet to shine out, it is safe to stay at home, that is, not to come forward for the contest about matters which he has not fully apprehended, but to keep still and be quiet.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="163"><p> But he who has been carried away


by presumption, not knowing his opponents’ grips and throws, before he can be an agent will quickly be a victim and experience the death of knowledge, which is a far more woeful death than that which severs soul and body.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="164"><p> This is bound to befall those


who are cheated by sophistries; for they fail to find the way to refute these, and owing to their having regarded false statements as true and given

<pb n="195"/>

them credence, they die so far as the life of knowledge is concerned. Their experience is the same as that of those who are taken in by flatterers: for in their case, too, the true and healthy friendship of the soul is thrust out and overturned by the friendship that is essentially unwholesome.

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="165"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="38"/>


We must therefore advise those, who are beginning to learn, to decline such contests, owing to their lack of knowledge; those who are making progress, owing to their not being perfect; and those who have just attained perfection, because they are to some extent unconscious of their perfectness.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="166"><p> As


for those who disregard this bidding, it says of each of them, another man shall live in his house, shall become owner of his vineyard, shall marry his betrothed. This is equivalent to saying, “the faculties
<note n="3.195.a">Or “talents.”</note>
  mentioned of keenness to learn, of improvement, of becoming perfect, shall indeed never fail, but they associate with one man at one time, with another man at another time, going about and not tenanting the same souls always and changing from soul to soul.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="167"><p> In this the faculties resemble


seals; for these too, when they have stamped the wax, unaffected by the impressions they have made, after engraving an image on it remain as they were, and if the impression on the wax gets blurred and effaced, other wax will be substituted for it. So do not imagine, good sirs, that the faculties decay when you do. They are immortal, and ready to welcome ten thousand others in preference to you to the fame gained from them. These are all whom they perceive not to have shunned their converse as you did, owing to your foolhardiness, but to draw


<pb n="197"/>

near and pay great heed to safety.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="168"><p> If any man be


a lover of virtue, let him pray that all fair things may not only be implanted in him, but may shew themselves upon the surface of his soul, as do the exquisite proportions of beauty in a statue and a perfect portrait. Let him consider that there are myriads waiting to follow him, on whom in his stead Nature will bestow all the boons of which we have been thinking, the gift of quickness to learn, that of making progress, that of attaining perfection. Is it not better that, instead of leaving it to them, he should himself shine out and be a retentive steward of God’s gracious gifts, and that he should not, by gratuitously offering an opportunity for plunder, supply ruthless foes with booty lying ready to their hand?

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="169"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="39"/> Little advantage, therefore, is there in a


beginning to which a right ending has not set its seal. Quite frequently persons who had attained perfection have been accounted imperfect owing to their fancying that their improvement was due to their own zeal and not to the directing care of God.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="170"><p> Owing to this fancy they were lifted up and greatly exalted, and so came to be borne down from lofty regions into the lowest abyss and so lost to sight: for we read, “If thou shalt build a new house, then shalt thou


also make a parapet round thy roof, and so thou shalt not cause death in thy house, if the faller from it falls”
<note n="3.197.a">So the LXX, which Philo takes to mean “for fear you yourself fall.” The E.V. “that thou bring not blood upon thy house, if any man fall from thence” gives the real sense better.</note>
  (Deut. xxii.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="171"><p> 8). For there is no fall so


grievous as to slip and fall away from rendering honour to God, through ascribing the victory to oneself instead of to Him, and so being the perpetrator of the murder of one’s kin. For he that fails to honour That which IS slays his own soul, so that the edifice of instruction ceases to be of use to him. Instruction

has obtained the nature that never grows old, and for this reason her house is called “new.”
For whereas other things decay by lapse of time, she, however far she advances, retains the bloom of youth and is in her prime all along, radiant with unfailing loveliness, and renewing her freshness by her unceasing diligence.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="172"><p> Moreover in his Exhortations the


lawgiver charges those who have obtained large possession of good things not to inscribe themselves in their hearts as authors of their wealth, but “to remember God Who giveth strength to acquire power “(Deut. viii. 18).</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="173"><p> This remembrance, then,


was in his eyes the goal of prosperity, the putting forth of power the beginning: the consequence of this being that those who forget the end of their acquisitions cannot any longer derive real benefit from their beginning. The disasters which befall these men are self-chosen, the outcome of selfishness. They cannot bear to acknowledge as the Author of the good things which they enjoy the God Who brings to perfection the gifts which He loves to bestow

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="174"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="40"/> But there are others who, with every stitch


of piety’s canvas spread, have used every effort to make a quick voyage, and to come to anchor in her harbours, and then, when they were no distance away, but on the very point of coming to land, a violent head-wind has suddenly burst upon them, and driven the vessel straight back, stripping her of much of the gear on which her seaworthiness depended.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="175"><p> No one would find fault with these men for being


still at sea; for the delay was contrary to their wish and befell them when they were making all speed. Who, then, resembles these men? Who but he who vowed what is called the great Vow
<note n="3.199.a">The vow of the Nazarite is called (as in <hi rend="italic">Leg. All.</hi> i. 17) “the great vow” from Numb. vi. 2 ὃς ἂν μεγάλως εὔξηται εὐχήν (R.V. “a special vow”). For Philo’s interpretation <hi rend="italic">cf. Quod Deus</hi> 89, 90, where also the contact with the corpse is treated as an “involuntary” error.</note>
 ? For he says:

<pb n="201"/>

“If someone die suddenly beside him, the head of his vow shall forthwith be defiled, and he shall shave it.” Then, after a few more words, he adds, “The former days shall be void, because the head of his vow was defiled “(Numb. vi. 9, 12). </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="176"><p>The involuntary nature


of the soul’s failure is evidenced by both of the words which he uses, “sudden” and “forthwith,” for whereas in the case of deliberate sins time is required for planning where and when and how the thing is to be done, unintentional sins swoop upon us suddenly, without thought, and if we may so say, in no time.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="177"><p> For it is difficult for the runners, as we may call them,


after starting on the way to piety, to finish the whole course without stumbling, and without stopping to draw breath; for every man born meets ten thousand obstacles.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="178"><p> The first need then, which is the one


and only thing that is “well-doing,” is never to put hand to any deliberate wrong-doing, and to have strength to thrust from us the countless host of voluntary offences; the second not to fall into many involuntary offences, nor to continue long in the practice of them.
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="179"><p><milestone unit="para"/>Right well did he say that the days of the involuntary


failure were void (ἀλόγους) not only because to sin is void of reason (ἄλογον) but also because it is impossible to render an account (λόγον) of involuntary sins.
<note n="3.201.a">In <hi rend="italic">Quod Deus</hi> 90 they are not worth counting.</note>
  Accordingly, when people inquire after the motives for things that have been done,
<note n="3.201.b">Apparently meaning “<hi rend="italic">our</hi> motives for what <hi rend="italic">we</hi> have done.” Philo seems to be expressing in a curiously strong way the feeling that our “involuntary” errors are something quite independent of us. They treat us as strangers and we are taken aback when we find that they have happened.</note>
  we often say that we neither know nor are able to tell them: for that when they were being done we were not taken

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="180"><p> ’Tis a rare event then if God shall vouchsafe

to a man to run life’s course from beginning to end without slackening or slipping, and to avoid each kind of transgressions, voluntary and involuntary, by flying past them, in the vehement rush of matchless speed.
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="181"><p><milestone unit="para"/>These remarks on beginning and end have been

made apropos of Noah the righteous man who, after making himself master of the elements of the science of husbandry, had not the strength to reach its final stages, for it is said that “he began to be a husbandman,” not that he reached the furthest limits of full knowledge. What is said about his work as a planter let us tell at another time.
