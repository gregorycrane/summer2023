<head>On the Virtues</head>
<head>On Virtues Which Together With Others Were Described By Moses or on Courage And Piety and Humanity and Repentance
<note n="8.163.a">On this title see A pp. p. 440.</note>
 </head>
<head>On Courage</head>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="1"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="1"/> The subject of justice and all the relevant points

which the occasion requires have already been discussed, and I will take courage next in the sequence. By courage I mean, not what most people understand, namely the rabid war fever which takes anger for its counsellor, but the courage which is knowledge.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="2"><p>
<note n="8.163.b"><hi rend="italic">Cf. Spec. Leg.</hi> iv. 145.</note>
  For some under the stimulus of reckless daring, supported

by bodily strength and marshalled in full armour for war, lay low multitudes of antagonists in a general slaughter and win the well-sounding but little deserved name of noble achievement, yet though their victory makes them exceedingly glorious in the eyes of those who pass judgement on such matters, nature and practice have combined to make them savage and bestial in their thirst for human blood.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="3"><p>  But there are others who live on in

their homes with their bodies worn to a thread by long sickness or the burden of old age, yet healthy

<pb n="165"/>
and youthful in the better part of the soul,
<note n="8.165.a">Or if τῇ ψυχῇ is read, “the better part, the soul.” Cohn in his translation definitely adopts this, cf. § 30. The antithesis to σῶμα no doubt points to this, but it must be remembered that the idea that the mind or understanding is the better part of the ψυχή constantly recurs in Philo, and is emphasized below in § 187, cf. also § 85. Here it is particularly appropriate because the courage we are discussing belongs to ἐπιστήμη. I am inclined to retain the genitive.</note>
  brimful of highmindedness and staunchest valour. They never even dream of touching weapons of defence, but render the highest service to the commonwealth by the excellent advice which they put forward, and guided by unflinching and unswerving consideration of what is profitable, restore what had broken down in the personal life of each individual and in the public life of their country.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="4"><p> These then

who train themselves in wisdom cultivate the true courage. The courage of those others, whose life is distempered by an ignorance that resists all treatment, is falsely so named and should properly be called reckless daring, as in the case of coins where we say that the counterfeit is a likeness of the true type.
<note n="8.165.b">Or if the reading and punctuation in note 3 is adopted, “reckless daring,” the counterfeit (to use the term which we apply to coins) of the true type whose semblance it bears.</note>


</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="5"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="2"/> Further there are many other conditions in

human life admittedly hard to bear, poverty and disrepute and disablement and sickness in its manifold forms, in the face of which those of little wit all grow craven-hearted, lacking the valour even to raise themselves. But those who are full of wisdom and highmindedness gallantly gird themselves for the struggle and resist the foe with all their strength, counting his

<pb n="167"/>
threats and menaces a matter for much scorn and derision. Against poverty they pit riches, not the blind but the keen-sighted riches,
<note n="8.167.a">Plato, <hi rend="italic">Laws</hi> 631 C. See note on <hi rend="italic">Spec. Leg.</hi> i. 25, vol. vii. p. 615.</note>
  whose jewels and treasures have their natural store-house in the soul.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="6"><p> For under the grip of poverty multitudes have been

laid low, and like exhausted athletes have fallen to the ground enfeebled by lack of manliness. Yet in the judgement of truth not a single one is in want, for his needs are supplied by the wealth of nature,
<note n="8.167.b">The “wealth of <hi rend="italic">nature</hi>,” which is to be distinguished from the spiritual wealth of wisdom (see § 8), is described again in <hi rend="italic">De Praem.</hi> 99, <hi rend="italic">cf. De Som.</hi> i. 124 ff., where it is identified with the “bread and raiment” for which Jacob prayed. Here Philo seems to allow it a place in the “seeing wealth” (see § 7), though elsewhere that is an epithet reserved for spiritual wealth. It guards the body against poverty, but not against the other bodily ills enumerated in §§ 10–15.</note>
  which cannot be taken from him; the air, the first, the most vital, the perpetual source of sustenance, which we inhale continually night and day; then the fountains in their profusion and the rivers spring-fed as well as winter brooks ever flowing to provide us with drink; then again for our meat, the harvest of crops of every sort, and the different kinds of trees, which never fail to bear their annual autumn fruitage. These no one lacks, but everybody everywhere has an ample and more than ample sufficiency.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="7"><p>  But some making no account of the

wealth of nature pursue the wealth of vain opinions. They choose to lean on one who lacks rather than one who has the gift of sight, and with this defective guidance to their steps must of necessity fall.

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="8"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="3"/> So much for the wealth that is the guardsman

of the body, the happy gift of nature,
<note n="8.167.c">The translation takes εὕρημα in the common sense of “godsend” or “prize.” Otherwise “the thing which nature discovers and gives.”</note>
  but we must mention also the higher, nobler wealth, which does not belong to all, but to truly noble and divinely

<pb n="169"/>
gifted men. This wealth is bestowed by wisdom through the doctrines and principles of ethic, logic and physic,
<note n="8.169.a">For the triple division of philosophy see note on <hi rend="italic">Spec. Leg.</hi> i. 336 and the references there given.</note>
  and from these spring the virtues, which rid the soul of its proneness to extravagance, and engender the love of contentment and frugality, which will assimilate it to God.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="9"><p>
<note n="8.169.b">Or “as befits its assimilation,” i.e. it is part of the process which the sage goes through in his endeavour to resemble God. <hi rend="italic">Cf. Spec. Leg.</hi> iv. 188 and § 168 below.</note>
  For God has no

wants, He needs nothing, being in Himself all-sufficient to Himself, while the fool has many wants, ever thirsting for what is not there, longing to gratify his greedy and insatiable desire, which he fans into a blaze like a fire and brings both great and small within its reach. But the man of worth has few wants, standing midway between mortality and immortality. Some wants he has because his body is mortal, many he has not in virtue of his soul, which desires immortality.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="10"><p>  This is the way in which the wise

pit riches against poverty. Against disrepute they pit good fame,
<note n="8.169.c">Or perhaps a stronger word as “glory,” i.e. in the eyes of the wise, not a glory which implies celebrity. On the contrary, the multitude are more likely to abuse such people. So in <hi rend="italic">De Sob.</hi> 57 the sage is not ἔνδοξος but εὐκλεής, where perhaps the translation “not merely of high report” may have missed the sense.</note>
  for the praise which has its fountain head in noble conduct, flowing thence as from a perennial spring, has no currency among the unthinking masses, whose habit is to expose the inconstancies of their souls by random talk, often in order to purchase some shameful reward unblushingly directed against these men of choicest merit.
<note n="8.169.d">More literally “picked out as the best,” an odd phrase here, since usually it refers to actual selection, <hi rend="italic">cf. e.g.</hi> § 42. That it does not mean this here nor imply that the multitude are apt to speak evil of dignities, but refers to the wise εὐκλεεῖς, is shown by τούτων κτλ. in the next sentence.</note>
  But the number of these is small, for virtue is not widespread among mortal kind.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="11"><p>  Again there

is disablement of the senses. To live with this has

<pb n="171"/>
been premature death to thousands, because they can find no medicine to protect them against its ills. Its opponent is wisdom, the best quality we have, which plants eyes in the mind, and the mind in keenness of vision excels the eyes of the body so that they, as people say, are a “mere nothing”
<note n="8.171.a">Lit. “excels by the whole and all.” The addition of φασί suggests that the phrase is colloquial.</note>
  in comparison.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="12"><p> The body’s eyes observe the surfaces of things visible

and need the external help of light, but the mind penetrates through the depth of material things, accurately observing their whole contents and their several parts, surveying also the nature of things immaterial, which sense is unable to descry. For we may say that it achieves all the keenness of vision, which an eye can have, without needing any adventitious light, itself a star and, we may say, a copy and likeness of the heavenly company.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="13"><p>  Again


diseases of the body, if the soul is healthy, do very little harm. And the health of the soul is to have its faculties, reason, high spirit and desire happily tempered, with the reason in command and reining in both the other two, like restive horses.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="14"><p>
<note n="8.171.b">For the triple division of the soul <hi rend="italic">cf. Spec. Leg.</hi> iv. 92 and note. In the “restive horses” there is an allusion to the parable in Plato, <hi rend="italic">Phaedrus</hi> 253 D, where the charioteer is to be interpreted as reason, and the two horses as high spirit and desire, a parable interpreted in the same sense also by Philo, <hi rend="italic">Leg. All.</hi> i. 72 f.</note>
  The

special name of this health is temperance, that is σωφροσύνη or “thought-preserving,”
<note n="8.171.c"><hi rend="italic">Cf.</hi> Plato, <hi rend="italic">Cratylus</hi> 411 D σωφροσύνη δὲ σωτηρία . . . φρονήσεως.</note>
  for it creates a preservation of one of our powers, namely, that of wise-thinking. For often when that power is in danger of being submerged by the tide of the passions, this spiritual health prevents it from being lost in the depths and pulls it up and lifts it on high, vitalizing and quickening it, and giving it a kind of immortality.

<pb n="173"/>
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="15"><p><milestone unit="para"/>All the above are lessons and instructions, which

stand recorded in many places of the law, urging the tractable in gentle, the intractable in sterner terms to despise the bodily and external goods, holding the life of virtue to be the one sole end and pursuing after everything else that is conducive to it.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="16"><p> And if I

had not in my earlier writings dealt fully with each of the rules which promote simplicity, I would attempt to dilate on them at this point, and embrace in a collected list the scattered precepts which appear in different places. But as I have said all that occasion required, I think it better not to repeat myself.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="17"><p> Still those who do not shrink from the task but are

at pains to study the books which precede these, ought to perceive that practically everything there said about simplicity
<note n="8.173.a">On ἀτυφία and τῦφος see App. p. 440.</note>
  includes the thought of courage, since it is the mark of a soul, vigorous, gallant and full of mettle, that it despises everything which vanity is wont to glorify to the destruction of life in any true sense.

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="18"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="4"/> So earnestly and carefully does the law desire

to train and exercise the soul to manly courage that it lays down rules even about the kind of garment which should be worn. It strictly forbids a man to assume a woman’s garb, in order that no trace, no merest shadow of the female, should attach to him to spoil his masculinity.
<note n="8.173.b">Deut. xxii. 5.</note>
  For as it always follows nature, its will is to lay down rules suitable and consistent with each other, even down to the very smallest matters, whose commonplace nature seems to set them in the background.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="19"><p> For since it saw as

clearly, as if they were outlines on a flat surface,

<pb n="175"/>
how unlike the bodily shapes of man and woman are, and that each of the two has a different life assigned to it, to the one a domestic, to the other a civic life, it judged it well in other matters too to prescribe rules all of which though not directly made by nature were the outcome of wise reflection and in accordance with nature. These were such as dealt with habits of life and dress and any similar matters.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="20"><p> It considered that in such matters the true

man should maintain his masculinity, particularly in his clothes, which as he always wears them by day and night ought to have nothing to suggest unmanliness.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="21"><p> In the same way he trained the woman to

decency of adornment and forbade her to assume the dress of a man, with the further object of guarding against the mannish-woman as much as the womanish-man. He knew that as in buildings, if one of the foundation stones is removed, the rest will not remain as they were.

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="22"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="5"/> To proceed, since the time in which human

events occur may be divided into war-time and peacetime, we may observe the place taken by the virtues in both. In regard to the others this has been discussed already
<note n="8.175.a">It is difficult to see to what Philo refers (<hi rend="italic">cf. De Praem.</hi> 3). Peace is of course the ordinary sphere of all the virtues except ἀνδρεία, and nearly every event or law would come under this head. He has dealt with δικαιοσύνη in war in <hi rend="italic">Spec. Leg.</hi> iv. 219–222, and εὐσέβεια, which is quite as prominent as ἀνδρεία in the coming story of the Midianite war, might be found in the earlier account of that war in <hi rend="italic">Mos.</hi> i. 305 ff., or that against Amalek, <hi rend="italic">ibid.</hi> 215 ff. So too Abraham’s conduct of the war against the four kings is ascribed to φιλανθρωπία, <hi rend="italic">De Abr.</hi> 232.</note>
  and will be again if need arise, but courage at this point calls for a close examination. The effects it produces in peace are extolled by him in many places of the law book, and he is always ready to seize opportunity for so doing. These have been

<pb n="177"/>
noted in their proper places
<note n="8.177.a">Here again the reference is vague. As ἀνδρεία in peace has just been equated to ἀτυφία, we should expect Philo to say that he has just discussed it, but the reference to Moses’ frequent insistence on it suggests something different.</note>
  and we will now begin to describe its feats in war. One prefatory remark, however, must be made.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="23"><p> He considers that in drawing

up the roll of soldiers, the summons should not include all those of military age, but he would have some excluded, reasonable excuses being added for their exemption from service. These are in the first instance the cravens and cowards who are sure to be the victims of their ingrained feebleness and create fear in the other combatants.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="24"><p>
<note n="8.177.b">Deut. xx. 8 “What man is there who fears and is cowardly in his heart? let him go and return to his house, lest he make the heart of his brother cowardly as is his own.” Actually this is spoken on the battlefield by the “officers” (E.V.), for which the LXX has γραμματεῖς (“scribes”), a word which may have influenced Philo in connecting the exemption with drawing up the roll.</note>
  For the evil

in one man is often well reproduced
<note n="8.177.c">Or “makes a powerful impression on.” The metaphor, as in other compounds of μάττομαι, is taken from the copy produced by stamping wax. Perhaps “infect,” though a different metaphor, will give the sense more vividly in English.</note>
  in his neighbour, particularly in war, where trepidation
<note n="8.177.d">A somewhat inadequate translation for ἀγωνία which is defined by Diogenes Laertius as φόβος ἀδήλου πράγματος. See note on <hi rend="italic">De Dec.</hi> 145 (vol. vii. p. 612).</note>
  has confused the reasoning faculty and rendered it incapable of nicely estimating facts. People are then accustomed to call cowardice caution and timidity foresight and unmanliness safety-seeking, and so invest the basest actions with grand and fair-sounding titles.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="25"><p> And,

therefore, unwilling that his own cause should be injured by the cowardice of those who are to take the field and that of the enemy glorified by an easy victory over a contemptible
<note n="8.177.e">καταφρονητικῶς here denotes scorn for the feebleness of the enemy. Elsewhere, as in § 43 below, scorn of danger, <hi rend="italic">cf. Spec. Leg.</hi> iii. 126.</note>
  body of degenerates and knowing that a crowd of idlers is no help but an impediment to success, he excludes the timid and faint-hearted cowards on the same principle, I think, that a general does not enforce war-service on persons

<pb n="179"/>
who are diseased in body and are, therefore, excused by their infirmity.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="26"><p> But cowardice, too, is a disease,

graver than any that affects the body since it destroys the faculties of the soul. Diseases of the body flourish but for a short time, but cowardice is an inbred evil, as closely inherent or more so than any part of the bodily system from the earliest years to extreme old age, unless it is healed by God. For all things are possible to Him.
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="27"><p><milestone unit="para"/>Furthermore, he does not even enlist all the most

courageous, be they ever so robust both in body and soul, and willing to fight and face danger in the forefront. While He praises them for their resolution and for the public-spirited, zealous and undaunted temper which they show, he carefully inquires whether they are in bondage to any cogent considerations, whose force leads them where it will.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="28"><p> If, he says, a man has

lately built a house, but has not yet had time to occupy it, or just planted a vineyard, setting the shoots in the ground with his own hand, and yet has had no opportunity to enjoy the fruits, or has betrothed himself to a maiden, but has not married her, he is to be exempted from all war service, and so gain security through the humaneness of the law.
<note n="8.179.a">Deut. xx. 5–7. For a comparison of the treatment of these verses here given with that of <hi rend="italic">De Agr.</hi> 148 if. see App. p. 441.</note>
  And this for

<pb n="181"/>
two reasons.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="29"><p> One is that, since the issues of war

are uncertain, others should not take without toil or trouble the property of those who have laboured to get it. For it seems cruel that a man should not be able to enjoy his own, and that one should build a house and another live in it, or should plant a vineyard and another who did not plant it should reap the fruit, or should pledge himself to a maiden and another not so pledged should marry her, and, therefore, it was not right to render futile the hopes of those who expected to find themselves living under happy conditions.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="30"><p>  Another object was that when


their bodies were fighting their souls should not play the laggard. In such circumstances, their minds must needs be feeling the strain of yearning for the joys from which they have been torn. Just as hungry or thirsty people, when some food or drink presents itself, race in pursuit of it without a backward glance in their eagerness to partake of it, so those who have laboured to gain a lawful wife or a house or a farm, and hopefully think that a time for using it is on the point of arriving, are distressed when they are robbed of its enjoyment, and thus though present in the body, are absent in the better part, the soul,
<note n="8.181.a">Or if ψυχῆς is read (see note 4), “the better part of the soul.” There is certainly a presumption in favour of consistency between § 3 and here, but perhaps it is of some weight that there the quality indicated is λογισμός; here it is rather θυμός, which is or may be part of the lower soul.</note>
  which is the determining factor of success or failure.

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="31"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="6"/> So

then he did not think that the military enlistment should include these or others like them, but rather persons into whom no passion has found an entry and there made its home, in order that with free and unfettered alacrity they might gird themselves to

<pb n="183"/>
face danger without evasion. For just as a body which suffers from sickness or injuries has no use for a full suit of armour and will discard it as beyond its feeble strength, so a robust body will be ruined if the soul is afflicted with a passion which does not accord with the task before it.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="32"><p> With these

considerations before him he selects not only his captains and generals, and other officers, but also each soldier, by testing him to see how far his body is in good condition, and his thinking sound. Of the body he inquires if it is without defect, healthy through and through, with all its parts and limbs well adjusted for the postures and movements required of each: of the soul, whether it is charged with valour and enterprise, whether it is proof against panic and full of generous sagacity, whether it cherishes honour and prefers death with renown to inglorious life?</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="33"><p> Each of these qualities separately in itself is in very

truth a power; if they all meet and combine, those who possess them will display a strength sufficient and more than sufficient to defy all combatants and opponents, and will win a bloodless victory over their enemies.
<note n="8.183.a">These two sections have no reference to the text of Deuteronomy, which does not suggest any such selection, but are based on the selection mentioned below in § 42. For the principles of that selection Philo draws on his imagination.</note>


<pb n="185"/>

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="34"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="7"/> A very clear proof of these statements is

included in the sacred books.
<note n="8.185.a">For the narrative which follows see Num. xxv. 1–18 and xxxi. 1–18 and compare the parallel account in <hi rend="italic">Mos.</hi> i. 295–311. There the seduction by the women is equally prominent, but the details are given in the form of advice tendered by Balaam to Balak, against whom the war is waged, the Midianites not being mentioned. Here Balaam is not mentioned, nor is Phinehas. For the relation of Philo’s account to the biblical see App. p. 443.</note>
  The Arabians, whose name in old times was Midianites, are a very populous nation. They were disposed to be hostile to the Hebrews, the main reason being the reverence and honour which that people, dedicated to the Maker and Father of all, pays to the supreme and primal Cause. Accordingly they contrived all possible devices and made all possible attempts
<note n="8.185.b">Or “laid down snares.” See App. p. 444.</note>
  to turn them away from honouring the One, the truly Existent, and to change their religion to impiety. For if they succeeded in this, they thought they would make an easy conquest. But when after countless efforts of word and deed they were utterly exhausted, like men in peril of death,
<note n="8.185.c">For this use of θανατάω, as against the accepted meaning of “desire to die,” see note on <hi rend="italic">Spec. Leg.</hi> iii. 102 (vol. vii. p. 636).</note>
  where there is no hope of salvation, they as a last resource devised a scheme of the following kind.</p></div>

  But there are one or two achievements at the end of his .life, which deserve to be mentioned as proofs of the constant and unbroken nobleness of life which he impressed as a final sealing, clear and distinct, on a soul which had taken shape under the graving of God.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="53"><p> When the appointed limit of his mortal life was about

to be reached and he knew by unmistakable warnings that he must depart hence, he did not imitate any of the other kings and commoners, whose one eager

Nor did he let himself be governed by family affection and favouritism to his own connexions, though even if the claims of his sons were under suspicion he had nephews at any rate of great excellence who held the highest priesthood as a reward for their virtue.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="54"><p> But

perhaps he did not think fit to withdraw them from the service of God, or reasonably enough considered that it was impossible for the same persons to do justice to both offices, the priesthood and sovereignty, one of which professes the service of God, the other the guardianship of men. Perhaps, too, he did not think it well to constitute himself the judge of a great matter, and no matter is so great as the task of testing and selecting the person best fitted by nature for command, a task which almost demands the divine power that alone can see with ease into the character of a man.

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="55"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="10"/> The clearest proof I can give of


this statement is as follows. He had a friend whom he had known well almost from his earliest years, Joshua by name. This friendship had not been effected in any of the ways that other friends are usually made, but by the rapturous love, which is of heaven, all pure, and truly from God, from which in fact all virtue springs. This Joshua had shared his home and board, except when solitude was prescribed to him, that is when he was under inspiration and receiving the oracles. All other services he rendered him on a different footing from the multitude and was almost his lieutenant, associated with him in the duties of government.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="56"><p> Yet although Moses had so long carefully


tested his excellence in word and deed, and,

<pb n="199"/>
what was most vital of all, his loyal affection for the nation, he did not think he should leave the succession even to him. He feared that he might be deceived in thinking him a good man when he was not really so, since the standards of human judgement are such as to be vague and uncertain.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="57"><p> And therefore, slow

to trust in himself, he besought and entreated God, who surveys the invisible soul and to whom alone it is given to discern the secrets of the mind, to choose on his merits the man most fitted to command, who would care for his subjects as a father.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="58"><p> And stretching up to heaven his pure, and, as it might be put figuratively, his virgin hands he said,
<note n="8.199.a">Num. xxvii. 16, 17.</note>
  “Let the God

of spirits and all flesh
<note n="8.199.b">So LXX. E.V. “spirits of all flesh,”</note>
  look to find a man to set over the multitude to guard and protect it, a shepherd who shall lead it blamelessly that the nation may not decay
<note n="8.199.c">Or “waste away.”</note>
  like a flock scattered about without one to guide it.”</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="59"><p> Yet who of those who heard this prayer

would not have been astounded? “Master,” he would say, “what do you mean, have you not lawful sons, have you not nephews?</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="60"><p> Bequeath the sovereignty to your sons as the first choice, for they naturally take precedence as heirs, or if you reject them, at least to your nephews, or if you count them also unsuitable

and prefer the people at large to your nearest and

<pb n="201"/>
closest, you have a blameless friend who has given proof of perfect virtue to your unerring wisdom. Why do you not think fit to approve of him, if the choice is not to rest on birth but on high excellence of life.”</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="61"><p> He will say in reply, “It is very right that we should

take God for our Judge in all things and particularly in great matters, where a decision for good or ill brings happiness, or, contrariwise, misery to countless multitudes. No matter is greater than sovereignty, to which is committed the charge of all the affairs of cities and countries in war and peace. For just as successful navigation demands a pilot of good judgement and knowledge, so, too, a governor of all-round wisdom is needed to secure for his subjects in every place a happy and orderly life.</p></div>

  and it is not lawful or possible that any other should judge her save God, and those who love her with a love that is guileless and pure and genuine.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="63"><p> I have learnt from my own history not to choose anyone

else from among those who seem to be suitable and approve him for government.

  surely

reason requires that I should follow in the same

steps, and, after having had God for my approver when I was about to take command, should give the election of my successor to Him alone without the participation of human judgement, which is nearer akin to the seeming than to the true. It is a special reason for so doing that the person appointed will preside not over some ordinary nation, but over the most populous of all the nations upon earth, one which makes the greatest of all professions that it is a suppliant of Him who truly exists and is the Maker and Father of all.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="65"><p> For what the disciples of

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="67"><p> When his disciple, Joshua, who modelled himself on his master’s characteristics with the love which they deserved, had been approved by divine judgement as best fitted to command, Moses was not depressed as another might have been because the choice had not fallen on his sons or nephews, but was filled with intense joy, to think that the nation would be in the

charge of one excelling in every way, since he knew that one in whom God is well pleased must needs be of a noble character. So taking Joshua by the right hand he brought him forward to where the multitude was congregated.
<note n="8.203.a">Num. xxvii. 22, 23.</note>
  He had no tremors at the thought of his own end, but had added other new joys to

<pb n="205"/>
the old, for he had not only the memory of earlier felicities, which every kind of virtue had given him, filling him to overflowing with delight, but also the hope of coming immortality as he passed from the corruptible life to the incorruptible.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="68"><p> Thus with a face beaming with the gladness of his soul, he said brightly and cheerfully, “The time has come for me to depart

from the life of the body, but here is a successor to take charge of you, chosen by God,” and he at once proceeded to recite the messages declaring God’s approval, to which they gave credence;</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="69"><p> then turning

his eyes on Joshua he bade him
<note n="8.205.a">Deut. xxxi. 7 and 23.</note>
  be of good courage and mighty in wise policy, initiate good plans of action and carry out his decisions with strong and resolute thinking to a happy conclusion. For though he to whom he addressed these words did not perhaps need the exhortation, Moses would not keep hidden the personal friendship
<note n="8.205.b">τὸ φιλάλληλον = “mutual affection,” when applied to one person signifies an affection which is strengthened by the knowledge that it is returned.</note>
  and patriotism which urged him like a spur to lay bare what he thought would be profitable.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="70"><p> Also he had received the divine command
<note n="8.205.c">Num. xxvii. 19 “Thou shalt give him a charge before all the congregation.”</note>


that he should exhort his successor and create in him the spirit to undertake the charge of the nation with a high courage, and not to fear the burden of sovereignty. Thus all future rulers would find a law to guide them right
<note n="8.205.d">Cohn takes κανὼν καὶ νόμος as predicate, “he should become a law.” Who then is “he”? Not Joshua, for Moses, who advises his successor, is the model. Not Moses, for Philo would have said αὐτὸν ἀποβλέπουσι. I take the words as subject to γένηται.</note>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="73"><p> He convoked a divine assemblage of the

A slightly different way of taking the passage would be to treat τῶν . . . βασιλέων as genitive absolute, “can the usurers be of any account, when the richest kings are shown to have no true wealth?”</note>
   But there are some who

It is here used like σπουδῇ γε in an ironical way, which, though ignored by L. &amp; S., is well illustrated in Stephanus, who gives several references to the orators, <hi rend="italic">e.g. Dem.</hi> 798. 20 ὃς γὰρ οἷς ὁ δῆμος ἅπας . . . νουθετεῖ μηδεπώποθ᾿ ὑπεῖξε . . . ταχύ γ᾿ ἂν φροντίσειε τοῦ παρ᾿ ἑνὸς λόγου.</note>

promoting humanity.
<note n="8.215.d">Lev. xix. 13, Deut. xxiv. 14, 15, <hi rend="italic">cf. Spec. Leg.</hi> iv. 195. Philo considers that this and other repetitions are covered by the defence given in <hi rend="italic">ibid.</hi> 204, and it is true that in his earlier notice of the law he did not dwell on the effect on the worker.</note>
  The wages of the poor man are to be paid on the same day, not only because it was felt to be just that one who has rendered the service for which he was engaged should receive in full and without delay the reward for his employment,

<pb n="217"/>
but also because the manual worker or load carrier, who toils painfully with his whole body like a beast of burden, “lives from day to day,” as the phrase goes,
<note n="8.217.a">Or “as some persons (i.e. writers) have said.” The singular ὡς εἶπέ τις generally, if not always, in Philo indicates a quotation. Mangey “ut quidem docent,” referring it apparently to the view that a manual worker is like a beast of burden. If ἐφήμερος is read instead of the otherwise unknown ἐφημερόβιος, I should suspect a play on the poetic use of the word (e.g. Aesch. <hi rend="italic">Prom.</hi> 83) for mankind in general as “creatures of a day.” The manual worker is “for a day” in the literal sense.</note>
  and his hopes rest upon his payment. If he gets it at once, he is glad and is braced up for the morrow to work with redoubled willingness. If he does not get it, besides the great trouble that this gives him, his nervous system is unstrung by his sorrow and renders him incapable to meet the routine of his task.

houses of his debtors, to take with violence a pledge or surety for the loan, but must stand outside in the porch and quietly bid them bring it out.
<note n="8.217.b">Deut. xxiv. 10, 11.</note>
  They, if they have it, must not hold it back, since the right course is that, while the creditor must not abuse his power to deal inconsiderately and insolently with the borrowers, the latter must render the proper surety as a reminder to repay what belongs to another.

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="90"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="17"/> Again who could fail to admire the ordinance

about reapers or grape-pickers?
<note n="8.217.c">Lev. xix. 9, xxiii. 22. E.V. “Thou shalt not reap the corners of the field.” LXX “Ye shall not complete the reaping.”</note>
  He bids them at harvest time not take up what drops from the sheaves, nor put in the sickle to the whole crop, but leave part of the field uncut. In this way he makes the well-to-do high-minded and liberal by sacrificing something of their own property instead of casting greedy eyes on the whole crop, and stacking and carting it all home to be kept like a treasure. At

<pb n="219"/>
the same time he gives fresh courage to the poor, for since they themselves own no landed property he permits them to enter the estates of their fellow-countrymen and reap a harvest from what is still left as if it were their own.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="91"><p> Again in the autumn when the

owners have the fruit picked he forbids them to collect the grapes that fall or to glean the vineyards.
<note n="8.219.a">Lev. xix. 10 (cf. Deut. xxiv. 21) “Thou shalt not glean thy vineyard, neither shalt thou gather the fallen fruit of thy vineyard.” The LXX for “fallen fruit” has ῥῶγας, which in itself only means “grapes” or “berries.” Philo explains it by adding ἀποπίπτουσας. Josephus, <hi rend="italic">Ant.</hi> iv. 231 gives for it τὰς ἐπιφυλλίδας (small grapes?).</note>
  He gives the same order to the olive pickers,
<note n="8.219.b">Deut. xxiv. 20.</note>
  acting like a very loving and very just father of children who have not prospered alike, some of them living in abundance, others sunk into the deepest poverty. These last in his pity and compassion he invites into the possession of their brethren to partake of what belongs to others as though it were their own, not in any shameless fashion, but to redress their privations and to make them partners, not only in the fruits but to all appearance in the estates also.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="92"><p> But there are

some so corrupted in mind, so engrossed in money-getting and every kind of profiteering as though it were a matter of life and death,
<note n="8.219.c">Or perhaps “wearing themselves out to death.” Philo has used this word which in other writers seems to mean “struggle against death” of the craze for the theatre, <hi rend="italic">Mos.</hi> ii. 211, and the despair of the Israelites pursued by Pharaoh, <hi rend="italic">ibid.</hi> 250.</note>
  never considering what its source can be, that they glean the olive-yards and vineyards and give a second reaping to the barley fields and wheat fields, thus convicting themselves of a slavish and illiberal meanness and of impiety to boot.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="93"><p> For they themselves have contributed but

little to the husbandry. The most numerous and most indispensable parts of all that goes to produce fruit-bearing and fertility are due to nature—the seasonable rains, the happily tempered states of

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="94"><p> And though they know these things and see

that it is nature who ever brings the accomplishment and bestows these rich boons upon them, they nevertheless dare to appropriate her benefactions, and, as though they themselves caused everything, refuse to share anything with anybody.

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="98"><p> For six years, says the law, the owners should have

the enjoyment in virtue of their ownership and labour on the land. But during one year, the seventh, when nothing in the way of cultivation has been performed, that enjoyment goes to those who have no landed possessions nor money. For it was felt to be unjust that some persons should labour and others have the produce. What is intended is that since the estates have been left, in a sense, without masters, and husbandry has had no hand in the work, the free gifts which come from God alone should come full and complete anticipating the wants of the needy.</p></div>

  He does not allow the purchasers to have absolute possession of what belongs to others, thus barring the roads to covetousness, in order to curb that insidious foe and source of all evils, desire.

humanity naturally exerts and carries it farther afield in his instructions about settlers.
<note n="8.227.d">Philo here distinguishes between the “incomers” or “proselytes,” and the μέτοικοι, who are not at any rate in the first instance co-religionists. Apparently this is based on the different tone in Deut. xxiii., from which he quotes lower down, excluding some races from the congregation altogether and admitting others only in a later generation.</note>
  He would have those who have immigrated under stress of circumstances, pay some honour to the people which has accepted them, in every possible way if the admission is accompanied by kind and hospitable treatment, in a more moderate degree if it is confined to mere acceptance. For the grant of a harbour in an alien state, or rather the mere permission to set foot on foreign soil is in itself a sufficient boon for

those who are unable to dwell in their own.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="106"><p> Mere

to inflict on the nation, ever combining old and new outrages in their ingenious devices for wreaking their cruelty?

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="112"><p> After this, live with her as your lawful wife,

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="113"><p> Each of these regulations

is quite admirable. First he did not allow rebellious desire to go unbridled, but curbed its violence by the thirty days grant of liberty. Secondly, he tests whether the man’s love is wild and giddy and wholely inspired by passion, or contains an element of reason and so has something of the purer kind.

Assuming that it is humanity which excludes from the altar, Philo might fairly argue that still more would it prohibit them for ordinary eating.</note>

outside other pangs to add to the pangs of travail by separating the mothers straightway from their offspring.

  for if they must be sacrificed, at any rate let it be at different times. It is the height of savagery to slay on the same day the generating cause and the living creature generated. And why does anyone do so?</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="135"><p> It must

Indeed, if one should mix the limbs of the two and fix them on the spits to eat of the roast, these limbs, I think, would not remain mute, but break out into speech, indignant at the enormity of the unexampled treatment which they suffer, and hurl a host of invectives against the greediness of those who prepare these meats, fitter for a fast than for a feast.</p></div>

In this way he is restraining the licence, primarily of those who practise infanticide, but also (§ 140) of all who disregard the rights and interests of others. It is difficult, however, to see the point of the sentence πάντων γὰρ . . . κτείνειν. I should like to think that it is the interpolation of a glossator.</note>
  For if the life which is still growing like a plant and

reckoned as part of the parent which carries it and now is at one with it, but in the course of months

will be severed from the common organism, is, in the hope that it will become a living animal, safeguarded by the invulnerability of the mother, to prevent the occurrence of the above said defilement, how much more is this the case with the creatures already brought to the birth and endued with a body and soul of their own? For it is the very height of unholiness to kill mother and offspring on the same occasion and on the same day.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="139"><p> It was on this principle, I think, that some

  These

decrees of theirs apply to human beings, but Moses rising to a further height extended the duty of fair treatment even to irrational animals, so that by practising on creatures of dissimilar kind we may show humanity in a far fuller measure to beings of like kind to ourselves, abstaining from strokes and counter-strokes to vex each other, and not hoarding our personal good things as treasures, but throwing them into the common stock for all in every place, as for kinsmen and brothers by nature.</p></div>

  For he held that it was grossly improper that the

substance which fed the living animal should be used to season and flavour the same after its death, and that while nature provided for its conservation by creating the stream of milk and ordaining that it should pass through the mother’s breasts as through conduits, the licence of man should rise to such a height as to misuse what had sustained its life to destroy also the body which remains in existence.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="144"><p> If indeed anyone thinks good to boil flesh in milk,

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="145"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="27"/> I also admire another law attuned to the

harmonious choir of those above mentioned. This

<pb n="253"/>
law forbids muzzling the ox when it treads out the corn.
<note n="8.253.a">Deut. xxv. 4.</note>
  It is the ox who, before the deep soiled lowlands receive the seed, cleaves the furrows and sets the fields ready for heaven and the husbandman; for the husbandman that he may sow the seed in due season, for heaven that its kindly gifts of rain may be received in the deep hollows which store them up and deal them out part by part as rich nourishment to the crop, until it brings forth first the ear and then the consummation of the yearly fruit. And after that consummation the ox is again necessary for another service, to purge the sheaves and sift the refuse from the genuine and useful material.
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="146"><p><milestone unit="para"/>But since I have mentioned the kindly and benevolent

injunction on behalf of the oxen when treading the corn, I will cite next the law enacted in behalf of cattle which plough the land.
<note n="8.253.b">Deut. xxii. 10, <hi rend="italic">cf. Spec. Leg.</hi> iv. 205, 206. The treatment here is the same and the moral also, with the difference that there the judge is admonished to do justice to the low-born, here all are encouraged to show kindness to men of other nations, meaning mainly no doubt the proselytes, consideration for whom figures so much throughout this treatise.</note>
  This is a law of the same family. It forbids the yoking together of an ox and an ass for ploughing the land, and has in view not merely the incongruity of the animals, since the ox is clean and the ass belongs to the unclean, and it is not fitting to put together creatures so alien in status, but also their disparity of strength.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="147"><p> It takes thought for the weaker, and would not have them suffer discomfort or oppression from superior force, and although the weaker, the ass, is banished from the sacred precincts and the stronger, the ox, is accepted by the law as a victim in sacrifices where perfection is most required, it did not despise the

weakness of the unclean, nor permit the clean to

<pb n="255"/>
employ strength rather than justice. Those whose souls have ears can almost hear it speaking plainly in a voice loud and insistent that we should do no wrongs to men of other nations, if we can accuse them of nothing save difference of race, which is no matter for accusation, since nothing which is neither vice nor springs from vice is liable to any impeachment.

that he shows it further in all its richness and profusion by passing, first from rational beings to the irrational, and from the irrational to plants and vegetation.

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="149"><p>
<note n="8.255.a">The argument in these sections, 149–154, is very involved. They are all based on Deut. xx. 19, which forbids cutting down the fruit trees in an enemy’s country (<hi rend="italic">cf. Spec. Leg.</hi> iv. 226 f.). The verse “Is the tree a man that it should be besieged by thee?” (i.e. trees are innocent things) applies to fruit trees under all circumstances and therefore forbids mischievous maltreatment of them (§ 149). This applies <hi rend="italic">even</hi> to trees in an enemy’s country, where if anywhere it might be thought justifiable (§ 150), and here besides the general argument of the innocence of plants (§ 150 and again § 154) there is a further reason, which has nothing to do with the main point, viz. that when peace is restored we shall regret that such a devastation leaves a feeling of resentment (§§ 151–153).</note>
 On this

third subject he gives the plain direction that no trees of the cultivated type are to be cut down, nor the lowland fields mischievously mown in the ear-bearing stage before the proper time, and in general no fruit is to be destroyed, in order that the human race may be well supplied with a rich stock of abundant kinds of food, and that this rich stock may consist, not only of necessaries, but also of things which make life comfortable. For the fruit of the corn-field is set apart as a necessary for the sustenance of men, but the numberless varieties of tree-fruits provide the comfortable life, and often in times of dearth a second line of sustenance.

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="150"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="29"/> Rising to a still higher pitch he forbids



<pb n="257"/>
them to devastate the land even of their enemies and enjoins them to abstain from cutting down trees and other forms of ravaging, holding it to be against all reason that indignation against men should be visited on things which are not guilty of any misdeed.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="151"><p> But further, he calls upon them to look not only to the

present, but, as though from some far-off height, with the keen-sighted vision of reason to consider the future also. For no one continues in the same stay, but all things are subject to vicissitudes and mutations, so that it may be expected that our enemies for the time may send ambassadors to initiate negotiations and straightway come to amicable terms.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="152"><p> Now

as friends it would be a great hardship
<note n="8.257.a">Or perhaps “a sad pity,” “a painful thing,” i.e. to ourselves, which will agree better with the interpretation of ταμιευσαμένους given in the next note.</note>
  to deprive them of the necessities of life and by so doing lay nothing by
<note n="8.257.b"><hi rend="italic">Prima facie</hi> the natural way of taking ταμιευσαμένους is in agreement with φίλους, “to deprive our (potential) friends of necessaries, who thereby lay nothing by,” etc. So Cohn and Mangey, and no doubt this makes good sense in itself. But it has no bearing on the sequel, which repeating the verb ταμιεύομαι dwells on the need of providing for the time when we should be on friendly terms and regret if we have done anything which could prevent this. Grammatically ταμιευσαμένους can agree just as well with the subject of ἀποστερεῖν as with φίλους. By conducting war humanely we lay up something to serve us in time of peace—a fine and sagacious thought.</note>
  which may be of service to meet the uncertainty of the future. It is a very admirable saying of the ancients
<note n="8.257.c">See App. p. 448.</note>
  that in joining friendship we should not ignore the possibility of enmity, and conduct our quarrels with future friendship in view, so that everyone in his own nature
<note n="8.257.d">Or “which becomes part of himself.” The meaning as I understand it is that actions of kindness affect a man’s nature and give him something to fall back upon.</note>
  lays by something to ensure his safety, and does not, through having neither deeds nor words to clothe his nakedness, repent the past and blame himself when it is no use, for his overcarelessness.
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="153"><p>This maxim should also be observed by states,

who in peace should provide for the needs of war and in war for the needs of peace and be slow to trust

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="154"><p> But even if we need not do

anything to help an enemy in hope of reconciliation, no plant is our enemy, but they are all pacific and serviceable, while the cultivated kind are particularly necessary, as their fruit is either food in the full sense
<note n="8.259.a">Or “as means of sustenance,” meaning presumably as in § 149 that the fruits become necessaries in times of dearth, but are delicacies at other times.</note>
  or a possession as valuable as food. Why then should we carry on hostilities against trees which are not hostile, by cutting them down or burning them or pulling them up by the roots—these trees, which nature itself has brought to their fullness with the waters which it showers and the breezes which it tempers so happily, that they may pay their yearly tributes to mankind as subjects to a king?

<note n="8.259.b">If the text is right the meaning may be as translated, or perhaps as Cohn “the strength which trains or equips.” But it is also possible to take τὴν ἀλειπτικὴν (<hi rend="italic">sc.</hi> τέχνην) as accusative of respect after ἀγαθῷ = “good at training.”</note>
  not only in animals but in plants, particularly in the cultivated kind, since they deserve more care and have not the same vigour as the wild species, but need the husbandman’s science to give them greater force and power.</p></div>

them, so that nothing mischievous may spring up at their side and hinder their growth. Also he does not permit them to pick the fruit to get enjoyment, not only because from the incomplete plant only incomplete fruit could come, just as animals not fully grown are not fully ripe for breeding, but also because of the damage it would do to the young plants, which are still, so to speak, lying low just above the ground, by preventing them from shooting.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="157"><p>
<note n="8.261.a">Cohn translates “because the young plants injured thereby and prevented from growing up would rise too little above the ground,” thus taking βλάπτεσθαι as a participle, and χαμαίζηλα = χαμαίζηλα ἔσεσθαι. Mangey seems also to connect χαμαίζηλα with ἔμελλεν by his χθαμαλοῦσθαι. But the version given above, which takes βλάπτεσθαι with ἔμελλε, seems to present no difficulty. Why picking the fruit should have this result remains unexplained in either version. The next section suggests that he means that the fruit should not be allowed to grow to a stage in which it could be picked for enjoyment.</note>
  Thus many

farmers during the spring season watch the young trees to squeeze off at once any fruit they bear before they advance in quality and size, for fear of weakening the parent plants. For, if these precautions are not taken, the result is that when they should bear fully ripened fruit they bring forth either nothing at all or abortions nipped in the bud, exhausted as they are by the labour of prematurely bearing the crops which lay such a weight upon the branches that at last they wear out the trunk and roots as well.</p></div>

<note n="8.281.a">The first part of this sentence down to “virtue” as here translated seems grammatically unimpeachable, and, I believe, gives a perfectly Philonic thought. Though the actual figure by which bodily and external goods are compared to officers serving practical needs as opposed to service in the court of virtue herself does not occur elsewhere, similar ideas are often to be found in Philo. Compare particularly the disquisition in <hi rend="italic">De Fuga</hi> 25–37, where the proper use of these things as a preliminary to the higher life of contemplation is enjoined. Remarks to the same effect appear in <hi rend="italic">De Sob.</hi> 61, <hi rend="italic">De Conf.</hi> 18, <hi rend="italic">Quis Rerum</hi> 285. There is more to be said for supposing a lacuna before αὐγοειδέστατον. The four words may be spurious, as they are omitted in S.

If he is worn to a thread by a long and wasting sickness, will it profit for restoring him to vigour that the athletic prowess of the founders of the family has placed them in the list of victors at the Olympic or all the other great games?

of the virtues, he gained with it all the other virtues, so that by those among whom he settled he was regarded as a king,
<note n="8.297.a">Gen. xxiii. 6. E.V. “Thou art a mighty prince among us.” LXX βασιλεύς.</note>
  not because of the outward state which surrounded him, mere commoner that he was, but because of his greatness of soul, for his spirit was the spirit of a king.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="217"><p> Indeed, they continued to

treat him with a respect which subjects pay to a ruler, being awe-struck at the all-embracing greatness of his nature and its more than human perfection. For the society also which he sought was not the same as they sought, but oftener under inspiration another more august. Thus whenever he was possessed, everything in him changed to something better, eyes, complexion, stature, carriage, movements, voice. For the divine spirit which was breathed upon him from on high made its lodging in his soul, and invested his body with singular beauty, his voice with persuasiveness, and his hearers with understanding.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="218"><p> Would you not say that this lone wanderer

without relatives or friends was of the highest nobility, he who craved for kinship with God and strove by every means to live in familiarity with Him, he who while ranked among the prophets, a post of such high excellence, put his trust in nothing created rather than in the Uncreated and Father of all, he who as I have said was regarded as a king by those in whose midst he settled, a sovereignty gained not with weapons, nor with mighty armies, as is the way of some, but by the election of God, the friend of virtue, who rewards the lovers of piety with imperial powers to benefit those around them?</p></div>

God aspire, but women also, who unlearnt the errors of their breeding, the ignorance which led them to honour the works of men’s hands, and became schooled in the knowledge of the monarchical principle by which the world is governed.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="221"><p> Tamar was

a woman from Palestinian Syria, bred in a house and city which acknowledged a multitude of gods and was full of images and wooden busts and idols in general.
<note n="8.299.a">Unless there is some independent tradition of Tamar’s lineage, about which nothing is said in Gen. xxxviii. 6 ff., we must suppose that Philo assumes that, since she is not said like Rebekah and Rachel and Leah to come of the line of the patriarchs, she belonged to the idolatrous people around. On Tamar see App. p. 450.</note>
  But when passing, as it were, from profound darkness she was able to glimpse a little ray of truth, she deserted to the camp of piety at the risk of her life, caring little for its preservation, if it were not to be a good life. This good life she held to mean nothing else than to be the servant and suppliant of the one great Cause.</p></div>

were women born beyond the Euphrates,

  in the extreme parts of Babylonia, who were handmaids and were given as dowry
<note n="8.301.b">Gen. xxix. 24 “Laban gave Zilpah his handmaiden unto Leah his daughter for a hand maid to her,” and so Bilhah to Rachel, <hi rend="italic">v.</hi> 29.</note>
  to the ladies of the house at their marriage. But when they had been judged worthy to pass on to the wise man’s bed, the first consequence was that they passed on from mere concubinage to the name and position of wedded wives, and were treated no longer as handmaids, but as almost equal in rank to their mistresses, who, indeed, incredible as it seems, promoted them to the same dignity as themselves.

by blood, did not think it enough to give a half affection to each other, but showed a twofold increase of tenderness in the love which they gave and received in return; and the seeming defectiveness in their relationship they made good by the eagerness with which they hastened to unite both families in harmony and reciprocity of feeling.

Enemies of our nation, because they give their compatriots licence to put their trust in the virtue of their ancestors and despise the thought of living a sound and stedfast life.
