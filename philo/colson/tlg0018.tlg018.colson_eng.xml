<head>About Those Whose Names are Changed and Why They Have Their Names Changed</head>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="1"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="1"/> “Abraham became ninety-nine years old and the

Lord was seen by Abraham and said to him, ‘I am thy God’” (Gen. xvii. 1). Nine plus ninety is next neighbour to a hundred, the number irradiated by the self-taught nature Isaac who is joy, the best of the good emotions.
<note n="5.143.a">Here used in the strict Stoic sense of reasonable forms of πάθος. See note on <hi rend="italic">Quod Det.</hi> 120. So also in <hi rend="italic">De Mig.</hi> 157, <hi rend="italic">De Cong.</hi> 36, and below, §§ 131, 188.</note>
  For Isaac is born to Abraham when a hundred years old.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="2"><p> A hundred also represents

the first-fruits given to the priests by the Tribe of Levi. For when the Levites receive the tenths they offer from them, just as though they were their own produce, other tenths in which we find the hundred (Num. xviii. 26). For ten is a symbol of progress and a hundred of perfection. Now he who is in the intermediate stage is always pressing forward to the summit, employing the gifts with which nature has blessed him, and it is by such a one that Moses tells us that the Lord of all was seen.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="3"><p> Yet

do not suppose that the vision was presented to the eyes of the body. They see only the objects of sense and those are composite, brimful of corruptibility, while the divine is uncompounded and incorruptible. It is the eye of the soul which receives the presentation of the divine vision.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="4"><p> Moreover what the eyes



<pb n="145"/>

of the body behold they apprehend through the cooperation of light, and light is something different from either the seer or the thing seen, whereas what the soul beholds it beholds by its own agency without the assistance of any other. For the conceptions of the mind are a light to themselves.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="5"><p> Our learning

of the sciences follows the same rule. The mind applies its eye which never closes or sleeps to the principles and conclusions set before it and sees them by no borrowed but a genuine light which shines forth from itself.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="6"><p> And so when you hear that God

was seen by man, you must think that this takes place without the light which the senses know, for what belongs to mind can be apprehended only by the mental powers. And God is the fountain of the purest radiance, and so when He reveals Himself to a soul the rays He puts forth are free from all shadow and of intense brightness.

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="7"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="2"/> Do not however suppose that the Existent

which truly exists is apprehended by any man; for we have in us no organ by which we can envisage it, neither in sense, for it is not perceptible by sense, nor yet in mind. So Moses the explorer of nature which lies beyond our vision, Moses who, as the divine oracles tell us, entered into the darkness
<note n="5.145.a">See App. p. 586.</note>
  (Ex. xx. 21), by which figure they indicate existence invisible and incorporeal, searched everywhere and into everything in his desire to see clearly and plainly Him, the object of our much yearning, Who alone is good.




<pb n="147"/>

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="8"><p>And when there was no sign of finding aught, not

even any semblance of what he hoped for, in despair of learning from others, he took refuge with the Object of his search Itself and prayed in these words: “Reveal Thyself to me that I may see Thee with knowledge” (Ex. xxxiii. 13). And yet he fails to gain his object.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="9"><p> To know what lies below the Existent, things material and immaterial alike, is a most ample gift even for the best sort among mortals, as God judges, for we read, “Thou shalt see what is behind

Me, but My face thou shalt not see” (<hi rend="italic">ibid.</hi> 23). It means that all below the Existent, things material and immaterial alike, are available to apprehension even if they are not all actually apprehended as yet, but He alone by His very nature cannot be seen.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="10"><p> And why should we wonder that the Existent cannot

be apprehended by men when even the mind in each of us is unknown to us?</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="11"><p> For who knows the essential nature of the soul, that mystery which has bred numberless contentions among the sophists who propound opinions contrary to each other or even totally and generically opposed?It is a logical

consequence that no personal name even can be properly assigned to the truly Existent. Note that when the prophet desires to know what he must answer to those who ask about His name He says “I am He that is” (Ex iii. 14), which is equivalent to “My nature is to be, not to be spoken.”</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="12"><p> Yet that

the human race should not totally lack a title to give to the supreme goodness He allows them to use by licence of language, as though it were His proper

<pb n="149"/>

name,
<note n="5.149.a">Philo seems to mix in this passage two somewhat different uses of the grammatical term κύριον ὄνομα: (1) a noun used in its literal or strict sense, opposed to metaphorical or loose usage (ἐν καταχρήσει, see note on <hi rend="italic">De Cher.</hi> 121); (2) a proper or personal name.</note>
  the title of Lord God of the three natural orders, teaching, perfection, practice,
<note n="5.149.b">See App. p. 586.</note>
  which are symbolized in the records as Abraham, Isaac and Jacob. For this He says is “My age-long name,” belonging as it were to the age of human existence, not to that when age as yet was not, “a memorial” too, not set, that is, beyond memory or apprehension, and again “to generations” (<hi rend="italic">ibid.</hi> 15), not to beings that were never generated.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="13"><p> For those who are born into

mortality must needs have some substitute for the divine name, so that they may approach if not the fact at least the name of supreme excellence and be brought into relation with it. And this is shown by the oracle proclaimed as from the mouth of the Ruler of all in which He says that no proper name of Him has been revealed to any. “I was seen,” He says, “of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, being their God, and My name of ‘Lord’ I did not reveal to them” (Ex. vi. 3). For when the transposition
<note n="5.149.c">Philo seems to mean that while το ὄνομά μου κύριον will naturally mean “my name κύριος,” the text should (or perhaps may also) be regarded as an “hyperbaton” or “unusual order” of ὄνομά μου τὸ κύριον, “my proper name” For the technical use of the term see App. pp. 586 f.</note>
  is reset in the proper order it will run thus, “My proper name I did not reveal to thee,” but, He implies, only the substitute, and that for reasons already mentioned.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="14"><p> So

impossible to name indeed is the Existent that not even the Potencies who serve Him tell us a proper name. Thus after the wrestling-bout in which the Man




<pb n="151"/>

of Practice engaged in his quest of virtue, he says to the unseen master,
<note n="5.151.a">I understand ἀοράτῳ, for which Mangey would substitute ἀρρήτῳ, to refer to the wrestling of the story taking place at night and stopping at dawn. Wendland suspected ἐπιστάτῃ and proposed παλαιστῇ, but Philo conceives of the angel rather as a master of the contest (ἀγωνοθέτης) training his pupil by wrestling with him; <hi rend="italic">cf. De Som.</hi> i. 129.</note>
  “Announce to me Thy name,” and he said “Why dost thou ask this my name?” (Gen. xxxii. 29), and he refuses to tell his personal and proper name. “It is enough for thee,” he means, “to profit through my benediction, but as for names, those symbols which indicate created beings, look not for them in the case of imperishable natures.”

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="15"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="3"/> Think it not then a hard saying that the Highest

of all things should be unnamable when His Word has no name of its own which we can speak. And indeed if He is unnamable He is also inconceivable and incomprehensible. And so the words “The Lord was seen of Abraham” (Gen. xvii. 1) must not be understood in the sense that the Cause of all shone upon him and appeared to him, for what human mind could contain the vastness of that vision? Rather we must think of it as the manifestation of one of the Potencies which attend him, the Potency of kingship, for the title Lord betokens sovereignty and kingship.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="16"><p> While our mind pursued

the airy speculations of the Chaldeans it ascribed to the world powers of action which it regarded as causes. But when it migrated from the Chaldean creed it recognized that the world had for its charioteer and pilot a Ruler Whose sovereignty was presented to it in vision.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="17"><p> And therefore the words are “The

Lord (not “The Existent”) was seen of him,” as though it would say, The king has been manifested, king indeed from the first, but hitherto unrecognized


<pb n="153"/>

by the soul, which so long unschooled has not remained in ignorance for ever but has received the vision of the Sovereignty which rules over all that is.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="18"><p>
But the Sovereign when manifested

confers a still higher gift on him who sees and hears him. He says to him, “I am thy God.” Which indeed amongst all this multitude of created things does not have Thee for its god? I might ask. But His interpreting word will shew me that He does not here speak of the world of which doubtless He is Creator and God, but of human souls which do not in His eyes deserve to be cared for all alike.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="19"><p> His will

is to be called the Lord and Master of the bad, the God of those who are on the way to betterment, but of the best and most perfect both at once God and Lord. For instance, when He has set Pharaoh before us as the crowning example of impiety He never calls Himself his God but gives that name to wise Moses, “Behold I give thee as god to Pharaoh” (Ex. vii. 1). But He often names Himself as Lord in the oracles which He gives.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="20"><p> We find such utterances as these, “These things saith the Lord”

(Ex. vii. 17), and at the beginning of His speech
<note n="5.153.a">i.e. at the beginning of the speech to which the earlier quotation, “Behold I give thee etc.,” belongs. But as another quotation has intervened, this is rather forced. I should like to read ἐν ἀρχῇ, καί, i.e. “as an opening phrase.”</note>
  “The Lord spake unto Moses, saying, ‘I am the Lord, speak unto Pharaoh, the king of Egypt, all that I speak unto thee’” (Ex. vi.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="21"><p> 29). And Moses says to Pharaoh, “When I go forth from the city I

will spread out my hands to the Lord, and the sounds shall cease and the hail and the rain shall not be, that thou mayest know that to the Lord belongs the earth” (that is all the bodily earth-compounded frame), “and thou” (that is the mind which the body


<pb n="155"/>

carries with it) “and thy servants” (that is the several thoughts which form its guard), “for I know that ye have not yet feared the Lord” (Ex. ix. 29), meaning that Lord who is not merely so-called but is Lord in very truth.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="22"><p> For none that is created is

truly a lord, though he be invested with a rule that spreads from pole to pole.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="23"><p> Only the Uncreated is truly ruler, and he who lives in fear and awe under that Ruler’s government receives a prize of truest value in His reproofs, while he who despises them has before him nothing but to perish miserably.So then He is shown to be the Lord of the foolish in

that He holds over them the terrors that are proper to the sovereign. Of those who are on the way to betterment He is called in scripture God, as in this present passage, “I am thy God,” or “I am thy God, increase and multiply” (Gen. xxxv. 11). Of the perfect He is both Lord and God as in the Decalogue “I am thy Lord God” (Ex. xx. 2), and elsewhere “The Lord God of your fathers” (Deut. iv.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="24"><p> 1), for it is His will that the wicked man should

be under His sway as his Lord, and thus with awe and groaning feel the fear of the Master hanging over him; that the man of progress should be benefited by Him as God and thus through those kindnesses reach perfection; that the perfect should be guided by Him as Lord and benefited by Him as God. For through the one he remains free from lapses, through the other he is most surely God’s man.This is best shown in Moses’ case.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="25"><p> “This is the

blessing,” we read, “which Moses gave, the man of God” (Deut. xxxiii. 1). To what a glorious, what a



<pb n="157"/>

holy exchange is he promoted that in return for God’s protecting care he should give himself to God.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="26"><p> But do not suppose that God becomes man’s in the

same way that man becomes God’s, for a man is God’s as His possession, God is man’s to be his glory and assistance. If thou wouldst have God as thy heart’s portion, first become thyself a portion worthy for Him to take, and that thou shalt become if thou escape such faults as are thine own handiwork and come of free will.

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="27"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="4"/> We should remember this also that the words

“I am thy God” are used by licence of language and not in their proper sense, for the Existent considered as existent is not relative. He is full of Himself and is sufficient for Himself. It was so before the creation of the world, and is equally so after the creation of all that is.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="28"><p> He cannot change nor alter

and needs nothing else at all, so that all things are His but He Himself in the proper sense belongs to none. But the Potencies which He has projected into creation to benefit what He has framed are in some cases spoken of as in a sense relative,
<note n="5.157.a">See App. p. 587.</note>
  such as





<pb n="159"/>

the kingly and the beneficial, for a king is a king of someone and a benefactor the benefactor of someone, while the subject of the kingship and the recipient of the benefit is necessarily something different.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="29"><p> Akin to these two is the creative Potency

called God, because through this the Father who is its begetter and contriver made
<note n="5.159.a">θεός being derived from τίθημι; see note on <hi rend="italic">De Conf.</hi> 137.</note>
  the universe, so that “I am thy God” is equivalent to “I am the Maker and Artificer.”</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="30"><p> And the greatest gift we can have

is to have Him for our Architect, Who was also the Architect of the whole world, for He did not form the soul of the bad, since wickedness is at enmity with Him, and in framing the soul which is in the intermediate stage He was not the sole agent according to the holiest of men, Moses, since such a soul would surely admit like wax the different qualities of noble and base.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="31"><p> And therefore we read,

“Let us make man after our image” (Gen. i. 26), so that according as the wax received the bad or the noble impress it should appear to be the handiwork of others or of Him Who is the framer of the noble and the good alone.
<note n="5.159.b"><hi rend="italic">Cf. De Op.</hi> 72 ff., <hi rend="italic">De Conf.</hi> 168 ff., <hi rend="italic">De Fug.</hi> 68 ff.</note>
  Surely then he is a man of virtue to whom God says “I am thy God,” for he has God alone for his maker without the co-operation of others.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="32"><p> At the same time
<note n="5.159.c">Or “indeed here with other lessons” (ἅμα), i.e. those of §§ 18 and 28.</note>
  Moses teaches us here

by implication the doctrine which he so often
<note n="5.159.d">In the other texts where God says “We” (see <hi rend="italic">De Conf.</hi> 16) and Gen. xlviii. 15, 16 (<hi rend="italic">ibid</hi>. 181).</note>
  lays down that God is the maker of the wise and good only. And all that company
<note n="5.159.e">See App. p. 587.</note>
  have voluntarily stripped themselves of the external goods which are so abundantly supplied to us, and further have despised what is dear to the flesh.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="33"><p> Fine, lusty and athletic



<pb n="161"/>

are those who use the body as a menace to the soul. Pale, wasted and withered, so to speak, are the children of discipline. They have made over the bodily muscles to serve the powers of the soul and in fact are resolved into a single form, that of soul, and become unbodied minds.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="34"><p> Naturally then the earthly

element is destroyed and dissolved when the mind in all its powers has a fixed purpose to be well pleasing to God. But that kind is rare and hardly to be found, though that such should be is not impossible. This is shown by the oracle vouchsafed about Enoch. “Enoch was well pleasing to God and was not found”
<note n="5.161.a">E.V. “Enoch walked with God; and he was not; for God took him” (LXX μετέθηκε). For “found” see App. p. 587.</note>
  (Gen. v.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="35"><p> 24), for where

could one search and find this good thing, what seas should he cross, what islands, what continents should he visit? Shall he look for it among the Greeks or the barbarians?</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="36"><p> Indeed are there not still among

the disciples of philosophy some who say that a wise man is non-existent
<note n="5.161.b">See App. pp. 587 f.</note>
  and therefore wisdom also? None, they say, from the beginning of man’s creation up to the life of to-day has been held to be completely free from fault, for absolute happiness is impossible to one who is imprisoned in the mortal body.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="37"><p> Whether

these statements are true we will inquire at the proper occasion. At present we will accept the text and say that wisdom is indeed something which exists, and so too is the lover of wisdom, the sage, but, though he exists, we who are evil fail to see him, for good cannot keep company with bad.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="38"><p> Therefore

we are told that “he was not found,” this type of character which was well pleasing to God, meaning



<pb n="163"/>

doubtless that though actually existing he was hidden from us and shunned our company. And to confirm this we read that he was “translated”
<note n="5.163.a">As E.V. in Hebrews xi. 5.</note>
  (<hi rend="italic">ibid.</hi>), that is, changed his abode and journeyed as an emigrant from the mortal life to the immortal.

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="39"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="5"/> These are men inspired with heaven-sent madness,

men who have gone out into the wild. But there are others who have followed a tame and gentle wisdom,
<note n="5.163.b"><hi rend="italic">Cf. Quis Rerum</hi>127.</note>
  and such are both eminent in the practice of piety and do not despise human things. This is attested by the oracle in which it is said to Abraham, with God as speaker, “Be well pleasing before Me” (Gen. xvii. 1), that is, “be well pleasing not to Me only but to My works, while I as judge watch and survey thee.”</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="40"><p> For if you honour parents or show

mercy to the poor or do kindness to your friends or defend your country or observe with care your duties to all men in general, you will surely be well pleasing to all with whom you have to do, but also well pleasing before God. For He with an eye that never sleeps beholds all things, and what is good He summons to Himself and approves with special favour.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="41"><p> And therefore the Practiser in his prayer will show

us the same truth. “The God,” he says, “to whom my fathers were well pleasing,” and adds “before Him” (Gen. xlviii. 15) to show us the difference in fact between being pleasing “to Him” and “before Him.” The latter embraces both kinds of well pleasing, the former is confined to one only.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="42"><p> And

so Moses in his Exhortations
<note n="5.163.c">See note on <hi rend="italic">De Fug.</hi> 170.</note>
  charges them in these words: “Thou shalt do what is well pleasing before the Lord thy God” (Deut. xii. 28), meaning do such things as shall be worthy to appear before God, and when seen to be approved by Him, and such

<pb n="165"/>

deeds as these commonly extend to our fellow-men.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="43"><p> It was this thought which prompted

Moses when he wove the tabernacle, dividing its precincts into two, and set a curtain between the parts to distinguish the inner from the outer (Ex. xxvi. 33); when too he gilded the sacred ark which holds the laws both within and without (Ex. xxv. 10), and gave the high priest two robes, the linen robe to be worn within, the many-coloured one with the long skirt to be worn outside (Ex. xxviii. 4, Lev. vi.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="44"><p> 10). These and the like are symbols of a soul which in

inward things is undefiled towards God and in outward things is pure towards the world of our senses and human life. And so those were fitting words which were said to the victorious wrestler when he was about to be crowned with garlands of triumph. For “Thou hast been strong with God and mighty with men” (Gen. xxxii. 28) were the words which proclaimed his victory.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="45"><p> To win honour in both spheres, in

our duty both towards the uncreated and the created, requires no petty mind, but one which stands in very truth midway between the world and God. And in sum the man of worth should follow in the steps of God, for the Ruler and Father of all cares for His creatures.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="46"><p> We all know that before the

creation of the world God was sufficient unto Himself and that after the creation He remained the same, unchanged. Why then did He make the things which were not? Why, save because He was good
<note n="5.165.a">See App. p. 588.</note>
  and bountiful? Shall not then we His slaves




<pb n="167"/>

follow our Master with profoundest awe and reverence for Him Who is the Cause, yet not forgetting the calls of our common humanity?
<note n="5.167.a">For the general thought of this passage with the same illustration from the two robes and the words of Gen. xxxii, 28 cf. the fuller exposition in <hi rend="italic">De Ebr</hi>. 80–87.</note>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="48"><p> The highest prize of “well pleasing” may be won

by positive well-doing, the second, freedom from blame, by avoidance of sin. And yet perhaps for the creature of mortal kind the former is declared by Scripture to coincide with the latter. For who, as Job says, is pure from defilement, even if his life be but for one day? (Job xiv.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="49"><p> 4). Infinite indeed are

the defilements that soil the soul, which it is impossible to wash and scour away altogether. For there still remain evils which are bound up with the life of every mortal, which may well be abated but cannot be wholly destroyed.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="50"><p> Should we then seek to

find in the medley of life one who is perfectly just or wise or temperate or good in general? Be satisfied, if you do but find one who is not unjust, is not foolish, is not licentious, is not cowardly, is not altogether evil.

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="51"><p> With good reason then did He say, “Become blameless,”

for He holds that freedom from sin and guilt is a great furtherance towards a happy life.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="52"><p>  And to him who has elected to live in this fashion He promises to leave a covenanted portion such as is fitting for God to give and man to receive, for He says “I will set my covenant between Me and

face.” Ah, what else should he do, when he heard the divine promises, but know himself and the nothingness of our mortal race, and fall at the feet of Him Who stands, to show what conception he held of himself and God? He knew that God stands with place unchanged, yet moves the universal frame of creation, His own motion being the motion of self-extension (not the movement of the legs, for He is not of human form), but a motion whereby He shows His unalterable, unchanging nature.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="55"><p> He

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="56"><p> Sometimes it is through involuntary

ignorance, sometimes through voluntary yielding to temptation, and so we read also that it was on his face that he fell. By face is meant his senses and his mind and his speech, and the gesture is little less than a loud insistent utterance. Fallen is sense, it cries, unable of itself to perceive, were it not by a dispensation of God’s saving providence set on its feet to the perception of material substances: fallen is speech, because it were unable to express in language anything that is, did not He Who framed and adjusted to harmony the instrument of the voice beat out the music of its notes, opening the mouth and giving strength to the nerves of the tongue: fallen too is the royal mind, robbed of its powers of apprehension, did not the Framer of all that lives raise it up and establish it, and planting in it far-piercing eyes, lead it to the sight of the immaterial world.

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="57"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="8"/> The frame of mind which shrank from Him

and fell spontaneously won God’s high approval by thus acknowledging of the Existent that it is He alone Who stands and that all below Him are subject to change and mutation of every kind. He addresses him with an insistence which is also a call to partnership.

this purport—there are very many kinds of covenant, assuring bounties and gifts to the worthy, but the highest form of covenant is “I myself.” He shews and

  and wage war to the death against what is holy, when they find anything which seems to them to fall short in propriety if taken literally, while really it is a symbol of the nature-truth which loves concealment, make no careful search for that truth, but disparage it and hold it up to obloquy.

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="64"><p> 19). If God did not

think fit to assign names even in their completed form, but committed the task to a man of wisdom, the founder of the human race, is it proper to suppose that parts of names or syllables or single letters, not merely vocal vowels but mute consonants, were added and altered by Himself, and a gift and pre-eminent benefaction alleged to be conferred thereby?

and in soul-betterments.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="66"><p>  The proof of this is easy, starting from the change of name here before us, for Abram is interpreted as “uplifted

father,” Abraham as “elect father of sound.”

  How the two differ we shall understand more clearly if we first discover the meaning of each.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="67"><p> Resorting then to

allegory we say that “uplifted” is one who rising from earth to the heights surveys the supraterrestrial, conversing with and studying the phenomena of the upper world, investigating the size of the sun and its courses, how it regulates the seasons of the year by its revolutions as it advances and retreats at the same rate of speed; one who considers also the different illuminations of the moon, its phases, its waning and waxing, and the movement of the other stars both in the fixed and the planetary order.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="68"><p> To inquire into such

matters bespeaks a soul not devoid of natural gifts or unproductive, but highly gifted and capable of engendering offspring perfect and without blemish; and therefore he called the student of the upper world “father” because he is not unproductive of wisdom.

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="69"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="10"/> Such is our definition of the

meanings conveyed under the symbol of the name Abram; those conveyed by “Abraham” are such as I proceed to describe. They are three in number—“father,” “elect” and “of sound.” We say that sound stands for the uttered word, for in living creatures the instrument of sound is the vocal power. Its father is the mind, since the stream of speech issues from the understanding as its fount. The elect mind is the mind of the wise, since it contains what

is best.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="70"><p> So then the first set of signs delineated the

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="73"><p> Just as there is no use for

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="76"><p> This is how we have

learned to regard the story of Abraham. Literally his name was changed, actually he changed over from nature-study to ethical philosophy and abandoned the study of the world to find a new home in the knowledge of its Maker, and from this he gained piety, the most splendid of possessions.

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="77"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="11"/> We will now deal with the case of Sarah his

  indicated by them. Sarai means my sovereignty, Sarah sovereign.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="78"><p> The

former is a symbol of specific virtue, the latter of generic, and in the same measure as the genus is greater than the species is the second name greater than the former. The species is small and perishable, the genus is large and imperishable.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="79"><p> And the gifts

which God wills to bestow are great and immortal in exchange for small and perishable, and to give such is a work well suited to Him.

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="80"><p> And therefore that specific

wisdom will perish with its possessor, while the other which like a seal gave it its shape, being free from all mortal element, will continue for ever imperishable.

Incidentally another lesson suggested at the same time is that every virtue is a queen and a sovereign and a ruler of the course of human life.

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="81"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="12"/> We shall also find that the change of Jacob’s

name to Israel is much to the purpose. Why so? Because Jacob is the supplanter, and Israel he who sees God. It is the task of a supplanter in the practice of virtue to disturb and shake and upset the supports on which passion rests, and all the firmness and stability which they have. That is a work which cannot commonly be done without hard effort and the stains of the arena, but only when one maintains the contests of wisdom to the end, and drilled in the gymnastics of the soul wrestles with the thoughts which oppose and hold it fast in their grip. The task of him who sees God is not to leave the sacred arena uncrowned, but carry off the prizes of victory.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="82"><p> And

what garland more fitting for its purpose or of richer flowers could be woven for the victorious soul than the power which will enable him to behold the Existent with clear vision? Surely that is a glorious guerdon to offer to the athlete-soul, that it should be endowed with eyes to apprehend in bright light Him Who alone is worthy of our contemplation.

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="83"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="13"/> It is worth inquiring why Abraham, after

the change of name, is not called by his old name, but always receives the same title as his right, whereas Jacob, after he is addressed as Israel, is in spite of this called Jacob many and many a time. We must reply that these are signs differing according as virtue acquired by teaching differs from virtue acquired by practice.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="84"><p> He who is improved through

teaching, being endowed with a happy nature, which with the co-operation of memory assures his retentiveness,

<pb n="185"/>

gets a tight grip and a firm armhold of what he has learned and thus remains constant. The Practiser on the other hand, after strenuous exercise, takes a breathing-space and a relaxation while he collects and recovers the force which has been enfeebled by his labours. In this he resembles the athletes who anoint their bodies. When they are weary with exercise they pour oil upon their limbs to prevent their forces being utterly shattered by the intensity and severity of the contest.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="85"><p> Again, the Man of Teaching has to aid him the voice

of his monitor ringing in his ears, deathless as that monitor himself, and thus never swerves: the Man of Practice has only his own will which he exercises and drills to aid him to overthrow the passion natural to created being, and, even if he reaches the consummation, yet through weariness he returns to his old kind.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="86"><p> He is more patient of toil, the other more blessed by

fortune. This last has another for his teacher, while the toiler, self-helped only, is busied in searching and inquiring and zealously exploring the secrets of nature, engaged in labour ceaseless and unremitting.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="87"><p> Therefore did Abraham in token of the even tenor

of his future life receive his new name from God, the unchangeable, that the stability of his future might be set on a firm foundation by Him Who stands and is ever the same in nature and condition. But Jacob was re-named by an angel, God’s minister, the Word, in acknowledgement that what is below the Existent cannot produce permanence unswerving and unwavering, but only such harmony as is found in a musical instrument wherein the tones now stretched to a

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="88"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="14"/> Again, while the race has three founders it

is the first and last of these, Abraham and Jacob, whose names were changed, while the middle founder, Isaac, has the same name throughout. Why is this? Because both the scholar’s form of virtue and the practiser’s are open to improving influences, since the former desires to know what he is ignorant of, the latter desires crowns of victory and the prizes offered to a soul which rejoices to toil and seek the vision of the truth. On the other hand the kind which has no teacher or pupil but itself, being made what it is by nature rather than by diligence, goes on its way from the first equal and perfect like an even number
<note n="5.187.b">ἄρτιον here combines its ordinary sense of “perfect” or “complete” with its technical use for an “even” number.</note>
  with no other needed as complement.
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="89"><p><milestone unit="para"/>Not so with the controller of bodily necessaries,

Joseph. For he changes his name and receives the title of Psonthomphanech
<note n="5.187.c">Hebrew and E.V. Zaphenath-paneah.</note>
  (Gen. xli. 45) from the king of the country. The meaning of this also needs explanation. Joseph is by interpretation “addition,” and conventional goods are an adjunct of natural goods. The former are such as gold, silver, chattels, revenues, services of menials, abundant stocks of heirlooms and furniture and all other luxuries, and the instruments of pleasure ready to hand in numberless forms.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="90"><p> The provider and superintendent of these,

Joseph, is found to have the appropriate name of “Addition,” since he is invested with the direction of the imported adventitious wealth which is an addition to the natural. This is attested by the



<pb n="189"/>

oracles which state that he stored up the food and managed the provisioning of the whole land (<hi rend="italic">ibid</hi>. 48) of the body.

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="91"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="15"/> Such a character the

tokens given lead us to find in Joseph. Let us consider the nature of Psonthomphanech. His name means “mouth which judges in answer.” For every fool thinks that the man of wealth who lives surrounded by a sea of outward kinds of substance must of necessity be able to reason aright, be capable of answering questions put to him and capable of originating judgements of value. And in general the fool holds wisdom to be subordinate to chance, instead of chance to wisdom, as he should do, since the unstable ought to be guided on its course by the stable.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="92"><p> And also his uterine brother

is addressed by his father as Benjamin and by his mother as Son of sorrow, and that is true to facts. For Benjamin by interpretation is Son of days, and the day is illumined by the sunlight visible to our senses, to which we liken vainglory.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="93"><p> Such glory has

a certain brilliance to the outward sense, in the laudations bestowed by the vulgar multitude, in the decrees which are enacted, in the dedications of statues and images, in purple robes and golden crowns, in chariots and four-horse cars and crowded processions. He who affects these things was with good reason named the Son of days, that is of the visible light and of the brilliance of vainglory.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="94"><p> This name

which exactly expresses the fact is given him by his father the head of the house, the reason. But the soul gives him the one that agrees with the experience by which she herself has learned. She calls him a son of sorrow. Why? Because those

<pb n="191"/>

who are swept along by the current of empty opinion are thought to be happy, but are in reality most unhappy,
</p></div><div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="95"><p>
for many are the counterblasts, envy,

jealousies, continuous quarrelling, rancorous enmities unreconciled till death, feuds handed down successively to children’s children, an inheritance which cannot be possessed.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="96"><p> And so God’s interpreter

could not but represent the mother of vainglory as dying in the very pangs of childbirth. Rachel died, we read, in hard labour (Gen. xxxv. 16, 19), for the conception and birth of vainglory, the creature of sense, is in reality the death of the soul.

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="97"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="16"/> Again, when the sons of Joseph, Ephraim

and Manasseh, were likened to the two elder sons of Jacob, Reuben and Simeon, have we not something perfectly true to nature?
<note n="5.191.a">As noted in the Introduction, §§ 97–102 are obviously irrelevant, as none of the four persons discussed have any change of name. The only link is that they show how different names symbolize contrasting qualities. Possibly the thought is partly induced by the proximity of the two sons of Rachel, <hi rend="italic">cf</hi>. the digression in <hi rend="italic">Quis Her</hi>. 252–266.</note>
  Jacob says, “Thy two sons who were born in Egypt before I came to Egypt are mine. Ephraim and Manasseh shall be as Reuben and Simeon to me” (Gen. xlviii. 5). Let us observe how the two pairs tally with each other.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="98"><p> Reuben, whose name is by interpretation “Seeing

son,” is the symbol of natural excellence, because the man who enjoys facility of apprehension and natural excellence is endowed with sight. Ephraim, as we have often said elsewhere,
<note n="5.191.b">See <hi rend="italic">Leg. All</hi>. iii. 91 f., <hi rend="italic">De Sobr</hi>. 27 f., <hi rend="italic">De Mig</hi>. 205 f., <hi rend="italic">De Cong</hi>. 40 f.</note>
  is the symbol of memory. For he is by interpretation “Fruit-bearing,” and memory is the best fruit of the soul. And no two things can be so close akin as memory and natural excellence.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="99"><p> Again, Simeon is another



<pb n="193"/>

name for learning and teaching, since Simeon is by interpretation “hearing,” and it is the peculiar mark of the learner that he hears and attends to what is said, while Manasseh is the symbol of recollection, for his name is “From forgetfulness.”
</p></div><div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="100"><p>
The advance

from forgetfulness necessarily involves recollection, and recollection is akin to learning. For what he has acquired often floats away from the learner’s mind, because in his weakness he is unable to retain it, and then emerges and starts again. When it flows away we say he is in a state of forgetfulness, and when it returns we call it a state of recollection.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="101"><p> Surely then memory closely corresponds to natural

excellence and recollection to learning. And the same relation which Simeon or learning bears to Reuben or nature is borne by Manasseh or recollection to Ephraim or memory.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="102"><p> For just as natural

excellence which resembles sight is better than learning which resembles hearing, the inferior of sight, so memory is in every way the superior of recollection, since while that is mixed with forgetfulness memory remains from first to last free from mixture or contamination.

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="103"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="17"/> Again, the chief prophet’s father-in-law is

sometimes called in the oracles Jethro and sometimes Raguel. He is Jethro when vanity is flourishing, for Jethro is by interpretation “superfluous,” and vanity is to the verities of life a superfluity deriding as it does equalities and the mere necessaries of life and glorifying surplusage and inequality.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="104"><p>
<note n="5.193.a">Or “the inequalities produced by covetousness.”</note>
  Jethro values

the human above the divine, custom above laws, profane above sacred, mortal above immortal, and in general seeming above being. And he ventures


<pb n="195"/>

to come self-bidden and take the position of an adviser and suggests to the sage that he should not teach the only thing worth learning, the ordinances of God and the law, but the contracts which men make with each other, which as a rule produce dealings where the partners have no real partnership.
<note n="5.195.a">The suggestion of Mangey and Wendland to explain away this extraordinary perversion of the story of Jethro’s visit to Moses by transferring the negatives seems to me quite untenable. If it brings the passage into better agreement with the LXX, it does so at the cost of making nonsense of the whole, by representing something which is to Jethro’s credit as being to his discredit. Moreover, the text as it stands substantially agrees with the account of the interview given more shortly in <hi rend="italic">De Ebr.</hi> 37. Philo apparently gets his interpretation by stopping short at v. 17 of Ex. xviii. and ignoring the rest. Moses has said that he teaches the people “the ordinances of God and the law,” and Jethro replies οὐκ ὀρθῶς ποιεῖς. The sequel goes on to shew that Jethro means that Moses should employ subordinates for minor matters, and the last part of § 104 seems to be a vague reproduction of this, but completely twisted, whether through perversity or lapse of memory, so as to describe a policy of injustice called in <hi rend="italic">De Ebr.</hi> “playing the demagogue, and laying down laws contrary to the laws of nature.”</note>
  And the great ones
<note n="5.195.b"><hi rend="italic">Prima facie</hi> no doubt we should take ὁ μέγας as meaning Moses, particularly as Moses in the story does accept Jethro’s suggestion. But in view of the impossibility of Philo ascribing to Moses the acceptance of such advice, I take it generically, and this fits in with the evidently intended antithesis to μεγάλοις μεγάλα.</note>
  of the earth accept all he says, and think that it is right to give great justice to the great and little justice to the little.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="105"><p>
<note n="5.195.c">The Greek might mean “assigns important administrations of justice, etc.,” but here again the overwhelming argument of the necessity of discrediting Jethro demands the translation given. Philo is perhaps thinking of Deut. i. 17, and xxiv. 13–16, where the thought suggested in the translation appears.</note>
  Yet often this

wiseacre changes round and leaves the flock which had him in his blindness for their leader: he seeks the herd of God and becomes therein a member without reproach, so much does he admire the nature of its herdsman and reverence the skill in governing which he shews in the charge of his flock.

many names.

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="126"><p> Why

these three? Because to enact fresh laws for the benefit of those to whom they would apply is the task of one whose hands are ever in touch with divine things, one who is called up (Ex. xxiv. 1) by the Lawgiver who speaks in oracles, one who has received from Him a great gift, the power of language to express prophet-like the holy laws. For Moses, if translated, is a “receiving”

<note n="5.209.b">The thought is: Moses’ “godship” to Pharaoh was particularly shewn in his not punishing him summarily, but allowing him so many chances of repenting, and in interceding with God for him, e.g. Ex. ix. 29.</note>

But as for the soul which is sterilized to wickedness and unfruitful of the endless host of passions and vices, scarce any prosper in childbirth as she.

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="161"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="30"/> Much the same

often befalls the soul. When good is hoped for, it rejoices in anticipation, and thus may be said to feel joy before joy, gladness before gladness.

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="162"><p> Observe the cultivated vine, what a wonderful piece

of nature’s handiwork it is, with its twigs, tendrils, suckers, petals, leaves, which seem almost to break out into speech and proclaim their joy at the coming fruit of the tree.

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="163"><p> And so the good

when it has come is accompanied by joy, and when it is expected, by hope. For we rejoice at its arrival and hope when it is coming. Similarly with their opposites. The presence of evil produces grief, and its expectation fear. And so fear is grief before grief, just as hope is joy before joy. For fear, I think, bears the same relation to grief as hope does to joy.</p></div>

laughter seems to have been as yet unborn in our mortal race, and not only did he himself laugh but his wife also. For again we find Sarah laughed, saying in herself, “Not yet has this befallen me till now,” this unstudied, self-sprung good. Yet He that promised, she says, is “my Lord” (Gen. xviii. 12) and “older” than all creation, and I needs must believe Him.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="169"><p> And to none of the wicked is rejoicing

permitted, as indeed the orations of the prophets proclaim: “Rejoicing is not for the impious, said God” (Is. xlviii. 22).

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="170"><p> I would


not say that the Egyptians really rejoiced when they heard that Joseph’s brethren had come. Rather they assumed in hypocrisy the appearance of joy.

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="175"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="33"/> Such indeed is the joy falsely so-called

of the fool. The true joy has been described above, the joy which befits the virtuous alone. “And so Abraham fell and laughed” (Gen. xvii. 17). He fell not from God but from himself, for in clinging to the immovable Being he stood, but fell from his own conceit.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="176"><p> And so when the spirit which is wise in its

own conceits had been thrown to the ground and the spirit of love to God raised up and firmly planted round Him who alone never bends, he laughed at once and said in his mind, “Shall this happen to one of a hundred years old, and shall Sarah being ninety years old bear a son?”
</p></div><div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="177"><p>
But do not think,


good reader, that when “he said” is followed by “in his mind” instead of “with his mouth,” the addition has little meaning. No, it is made with very careful purpose. Why so? Because in saying “Shall this happen to one of a hundred years,” he seems to doubt the birth of Isaac in which in an earlier place he was said to believe, as was shown by the oracular words delivered a little time before. Those ran, “He shall not be thine heir, but one who shall come from thee,” and then immediately followed the words, “And Abraham believed God and it was accounted to him for righteousness” (Gen. xv.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="178"><p> 4, 6). So then, since doubt was not consistent with

his past belief, Moses has represented the doubt not as long-lived, or prolonged to reach the mouth and tongue, but staying where it was with the swiftly moving mind. For, says the text, “He said in his mind,” which none of the creatures whose swiftness of foot we admire can outrun, and indeed no form

<pb n="235"/>

of bird nature has such speed.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="179"><p> This is, I think, the

reason why the poet most highly esteemed among the Greeks says, “like a bird’s wing or a thought.”

  He is showing the swiftness of the mind’s intensity, and to bring this out more strongly he puts thought after the bird’s wing. For the mind moves at the same moment to many things material and immaterial with indescribable rapidity and reaches at once the boundaries of land and sea, covering and dividing
<note n="5.235.b">The sense of the word is not clear. Wend, suggests συντέμνουσα “cutting down,” “making a short cut of.”</note>
  distances of infinite magnitude. At the same time it leaps so high from the earth that it passes through the lower to the upper air and scarcely comes to a stop even when it reaches the furthermost sphere of the fixed stars.</p></div>

it to rest and its onward journey carries it across wide spaces outside the limits of all this world of sense to the world framed from the ideas to which it feels itself akin.

perhaps it may be said, why did he, when once he had believed, admit any trace or shadow or breath of unbelief whatsoever? It seems to me that this question amounts to a wish to make out the created to be uncreated, the mortal immortal, the perishable imperishable, and if it is not blasphemy to say it, man to be God.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="182"><p> Such a person asserts that the faith

great ignorance to think that the soul of man can contain the unwavering, absolutely steadfast excellences of God. Enough for man is the power to possess the images of these, images in the scale of number and magnitude far below the archetypes.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="184"><p> And surely this is to be expected, for the excellences

of God must needs be unmixed since God is not compounded but a single nature, whereas man’s excellences are mixed, since we, too, are mixtures, with human and divine blended in us and formed into a harmony in the proportions of perfect music, and a compound of more than one ingredient is subject to natural counter-forces drawing it to each of these ingredients.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="187"><p> For, good friend, if you believe

an acre”

  and adopts the hundred in measuring out the plot (Gen. xxi. 33), and Isaac “finds barley a hundredfold” (Gen. xxvi. 12); and Moses in building the court of the tabernacle takes a hundred cubits in measuring out the distance from east to west (Ex. xxvii.</p></div>

  But the wicked man sometimes gives admirable expression to noble thoughts, but his actions are most vile and their method equally so. Such a one is Shechem, the son of folly, for his father is Hamor whose name is translated by “ass,” while his own is interpreted as “shoulder,” the symbol of toil.

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="233"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="41"/> I am profoundly struck by the law enacted

for those who put off their sins and appear to be repentant. It bids them bring first as the victim a ewe without blemish, but “if his hand,” it continues,
“have not strength for a sheep, he shall bring for the sin which he has committed two turtledoves or two young pigeons, one for sin and one for a burnt offering.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="234"><p> But if his hand does not find a pair of turtledoves

or two young pigeons, he shall bring for his gift fine flour the tenth of an ephah. He shall not pour upon it oil, nor put upon it frankincense, because it is a sin offering, and shall bring it to the priest, and the priest shall take from it a complete handful and lay the memorial upon the altar”
(Lev. v.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="235"><p> 7 ff.). Moses, then, employs for propitiation

the three methods of repentance here mentioned, beasts or birds or wheaten flour, adapted doubtless


<pb n="265"/>

to the capacity of the penitent who is purified, for small things do not need great, nor great things small purifications, but such as are like and equal on the principle of proportion.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="236"><p> Why then there


should be three ways of repentance is worth inquiry. Practically cases both of sinning and of achieving righteousness fall into three classes, thoughts and words and deeds. And therefore in his Exhortations Moses, when he is shewing that the acquisition of the good is neither impossible nor hard to pursue, says,
</p></div><div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="237"><p>
“You need not fly up to heaven nor go to the ends

of earth and sea to lay hold of it, but near and very near (and with the next words he shews the nearness as it were almost visible to the eye) is every work to thy mouth and heart and hands “(Deut. xxx. 12 ff.). In these three words he figures words, thoughts and intentions, deeds.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="238"><p> For good thinking and intending, good speaking and good doing make up, he means, human happiness just as their opposites make up unhappiness, since achievement of righteousness and

sinning are found in all these three places, heart, mouth and hand. For indeed some think and intend with excellent judgement and speak what is best and do what they should do. Of the three wrong thinking and intending is the least serious, and actually carrying out injustice is the most serious, while saying what we should not stands midway between the two.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="239"><p> Yet in practice the least serious proves to

be the most difficult to rid ourselves from, for it is a hard matter to bring to a standstill the soul’s changing movements. Their irresistible stream is such that we could sooner stem the rush of a torrent, for thoughts



<pb n="267"/>

after thoughts in countless numbers pour on like a huge breaker and drive and whirl and upset its whole being with their violence.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="240"><p> This then is


the best and most perfect form of purification, never even to admit any heinous thoughts, but to live with our fellow-citizens in peace and law observance, that order of which justice is the guiding influence. And the second best is to abstain from sinfulness of word, either by lying or perjury or subtlety or calumny, and in general from aiming at the ruin of others by giving a free rein to the mouth and tongue which it were better to bridle and bind with chains of adamant.

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="241"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="42"/> It is easy to see why


wrong-speaking is a graver matter than wrong-thinking. A man’s thoughts are sometimes not due to himself, but come without his will. He is compelled to admit ideas on subjects which he has no wish to consider, and where there is no will no blame is due.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="242"><p> But speaking is voluntary, so that if a man

gives utterance to language which offends, he is wronging others, unhappy in this, that even when there is an opportunity of speaking something of a kinder nature he is not willing to use it. Such a person would do best to court complete freedom from disturbance,
<note n="5.267.a">Or “silence.” See App. p. 592.</note>
  and if he has not this freedom he can surely if he wills it keep silence.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="243"><p> But


the unjust action is a more grievous sin than any speaking, for the word is the shadow of the act,
<note n="5.267.b">See App. p. 592.</note>
  men say, and if the shadow be harmful, the act must be more harmful. And therefore Moses exempts mere intention from accusation and penalty. He knew that it was largely subject to involuntary changes and swervings, and rather the passive victim of the thoughts which flock into it than an active agent.

<pb n="269"/>

But all that issues through the mouth he requires to make its defence and stand its trial on the principle that our speech is in our own power.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="244"><p> But in these

trials words are judged more leniently, culpable actions more severely, for he appoints great penalties for the authors of great misdeeds, those who carry into actual execution what their ill-intended intentions have planned or their reckless tongues have uttered.

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="245"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="43"/> For the purgation of these three, thought,

speech and action, he has named the sheep, the pair of doves or pigeons and the tenth of an ephah, the sacred measure, of fine flour, holding that thought should be purged with the sheep, speech with the birds, action with the fine flour. Why?</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="246"><p> Because just as

the mind is the best element in us, so the sheep takes the same place among the unreasoning animals considered as a whole, in virtue of its superior gentleness and the annual produce which it raises by itself, to benefit men and adorn them at the same time. For raiment averts mischief from frost and heat, and by veiling what nature would have hidden promotes decency in the wearers.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="247"><p>  Let us take then


the best animal, the sheep, as representing in a figure the purging of our best part, the mind, and similarly the birds as representing speech. For speech is light and winged by nature, moving swifter than an arrow, and flashing its way in every direction. For the word once spoken cannot return, but when carried outside races at a high speed, strikes the ears, and passing right through the whole region of hearing straightway turns into sound.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="248"><p>  Also

speech is twofold, partly true and partly false, and thence I think its comparison to a pair of doves or

<pb n="271"/>

pigeons. Moses directs that one bird should serve as a sin offering, and that the other should be offered by fire in its entirety, because it is a condition of true speech that it is entirely holy and perfect while false speech is the product of sin and needs reformation.
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="249"><p>The fine flour is, as I have said, the symbol

of action, for it is a condition of flour that it is not brought into a pure state without art and contrivance but is sifted by the hands of corn-grinders, who have made a practice of this process. It accords with this when he says: “The priest shall take a complete handful and offer its memorial”—by the handful bringing out the thought of handiwork and action.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="250"><p> And he makes a very careful contrast in

speaking of the beasts and the birds. Of the first he says “If his hand be not strong enough for the sheep,” and of the second “If his hand do not find.”
Why is this? Because it needs great strength and a very high degree of power to suppress the changing movements of the mind, but it needs no great might to restrain trespasses of speech.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="251"><p> For against trespasses

committed with the voice there is a remedy as I have said before in quietude, of which everyone can easily avail himself, though many through their loquacity and measureless chattering do not find any limit to put upon their words.

He had prayed for the less, God grants him the greater. He said to him, we read, “Yes, Sarah thy wife shall bear a son “(Gen. xvii. 19).

not that God, who brings about all good things, has brought into being this kind also, and though there be few such upon earth, in Heaven vast is their number.

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="258"><p> Why then need you still wonder

that God showers virtue without toil or trouble, needing no controlling hand but perfect and complete from the very first?

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="259"><p> The earthly food is produced with

the co-operation of husbandmen, but the heavenly is sent like the snow by God the solely self-acting, with none to share his work. And indeed it says “Behold I rain upon you bread from heaven” (Ex. xvi.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="260"><p> 4). Of what food can he rightly say that it is rained from heaven, save of heavenly wisdom which is sent from

above on souls which yearn for virtue by Him who sheds the gift of prudence in rich abundance, whose grace waters the universe, and chiefly so in the holy seventh (year) which he calls the Sabbath?
<note n="5.275.a">Wendland gives the reference for this as Ex. xvi. 23 ff. But this can hardly be right, as no manna fell on the Sabbath. The reference is clearly to the Sabbatical year of Lev. xxv. 4, 5, definitely called “Sabbath,” on which he has dwelt in <hi rend="italic">De Fug.</hi> 170 ff. ἡ ἑβδόμη seems to be used for ἑβδομάς in <hi rend="italic">De Decal.</hi> 159 and <hi rend="italic">De Spec.

him” (Gen. xvii. 22) are equivalent to “He perfected the hearer himself,” who before was devoid of wisdom, and filled him with thoughts that cannot die. And when the learner had become perfect, “the Lord went up from Abraham,” says Moses (<hi rend="italic">ibid.</hi>). He does not mean that Abraham was parted from Him, for by his very nature the sage is God’s attendant, but he wished to shew the independence of the learner. His purpose is that when the superintendence of the master is withdrawn, and no compulsion is applied, the pupil may make an exhibition of his own powers, and shewing a diligence which is voluntary and self-imposed may work out by his own efforts what he has learnt. For it is the way of a teacher to give his pupil opportunity of independent practice without suggestions from himself, and thus set upon him the stamp of indelible memory in its surest form.
