<head>On the Embassy to Gaius</head>
<head>(the first part of the treatise on virtues)</head>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="1"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="1"/> How long shall we the aged continue to be

children grown grey in our bodies through length of years, but infants in our souls through want of sense, holding fortune, the most unstable of things, to be the most unchangeable, nature, the most constant, to be the most insecure? For we change our actions about from place to place as on a draught board, and fortune’s gifts seem to us more permanent than nature’s, nature’s more insecure than fortune’s.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="2"><p> The reason is that, having no forethought for the

future, we are ruled
<note n="10.3.a">This use of βραβεύειν is doubtful, since when transitive it is usually applied to contests, suits and the like. If θεραπεύειν is read ἔχοντας is of course the subject.</note>
  by the present, following erratic sense-perception rather than unerring intelligence. For the eyes of the body discern what is manifest and close at hand, but reason reaches to the unseen and the future. Reason’s vision, which is keener than the vision of the bodily eyes, we bedim and confuse, some with strong drink and surfeiting, others with that worst of evils, ignorance.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="3"><p> | And yet

the present time and the many important questions decided in it are strong enough to carry conviction even if some have come to disbelieve that the Deity


<pb n="5"/>

takes thought for men, and particularly for the suppliants’ race which the Father and King of the Universe and the Source of all things has taken for his portion.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="4"><p> Now this race is called in the Hebrew

tongue Israel, but, expressed in our tongue, the word is “he that sees God” and to see Him seems to me of all possessions, public or private, the most precious.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="5"><p> For if the sight of seniors or instructors or

rulers or parents stirs the beholders to respect for them and decent behaviour and the desire to live a life of self-control, how firmly based is the virtue and nobility of conduct which we may expect to find in souls whose vision has soared above all created things and schooled itself to behold the uncreated and divine, the primal good, the excellent, the happy, the blessed, which may truly be called better than the good, more excellent than the excellent, more blessed than blessedness, more happy than happiness itself, and any perfection there may be greater than these.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="6"><p> For reason
<note n="10.5.a">i.e. those who infer the existence of God and His Powers from His created works have an apprehension inferior to the higher intuition of the Israel-soul. <hi rend="italic">Cf. De Praem.</hi> 40–46 and <hi rend="italic">Leg. All.</hi> iii. 97–99. Mangey understands λόγος as language (<hi rend="italic">sermo</hi>), which is perhaps more in accordance with the words that follow, but not so Philonic in thought.</note>
  cannot attain to

ascend to God, who nowhere can be touched or handled, but subsides and ebbs away unable to find the proper words by which it may approach to expound, I do not say the God who is, for if the whole Heaven should become an articulate voice, it would lack the apt and appropriate terms needed for this, but even for God’s attendant powers. Such are the creative, the kingly, the providential, and of the others all that are both beneficial and punitive,

<note n="10.7.a"><hi rend="italic">Cf Conf.</hi> 171 δυνάμεις ἀρωγοὺς καὶ σωτηρίους τοῦ γενομένου πάσας, αἷς ἐμφέρονται καὶ αἱ κολαστήριοι· ἔστι δὲ καὶ ἡ κόλασις οὐκ ἐπιζήμιον, ἁμαρτημάτων οὖσα κώλυσις καὶ ἐπανόρθωσις.</note>
  the punitive are to be classed among

the beneficial, not only on the ground that they are a part of laws and statutes, since no law can be complete unless it includes two provisions—honours for things good and punishment for things evil, but because the punishment of others often admonishes offenders and calls them to wisdom, or, certainly at any rate, their neighbours. For penalties are good for the morals of the multitude, who fear to suffer the like.

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="8"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="2"/> For who that saw Gaius when after the death

of Tiberius he succeeded to the sovereignty of the whole earth and sea, gained not by faction but established by law, with all parts, east, west, south, north, harmoniously adjusted, the Greek in full agreement with the barbarian, the civil with the military, to enjoy and participate in peace—who I say was not filled with admiration and astonishment at his prodigious and indescribable prosperity?</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="9"><p> He found

ready in hand a mass of accumulated goods, gold and silver, which he had inherited, some in bullion, some in specie, some as ornaments in the form of drinking-cups and other things which craftmanship produces for display; vast forces of infantry, cavalry, ships, revenues supplied like a perennial stream flowing from a fountain;</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="10"><p> a dominion not confined to the



<pb n="9"/>

really vital parts which make up most
<note n="10.9.a">Lit. “the most and most necessary.” For this frequent coupling of πλεῖστα with another superlative see note on <hi rend="italic">Flaccus</hi> 46 (vol. ix. p. 326).</note>
  of the inhabited world, and indeed may properly bear that name, the world, that is, which is bounded by the two rivers, the Euphrates and the Rhine, the one dissevering us from the Germans and all the more brutish nations, the Euphrates from the Parthians and from the Sarmatians and Scythians, races which are no less savage than the Germans, but a dominion extending, as I said above, from the rising to the setting sun both within the ocean and beyond it.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="11"><p> All these things were a joy to the Roman people and all Italy and the nations of Europe and Asia; not so much had they all exulted over any of his imperial

predecessors. It was not now a matter of hoping that they would have the possession and use of good things public and private; they considered that they had already the plenitude as it were of good fortune with happiness waiting in its train.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="12"><p> Thus nothing was to be seen throughout the

cities but altars, oblations, sacrifices, men in white robes and crowned with garlands, bright and smart, their cheery faces beaming with goodwill, feasts, assemblages, musical contests, horse races, revels, nightlong frolics with harp and flutes, jollification, unrestraint, holiday-keeping, every kind of pleasure ministered by every sense.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="13"><p> In these days the rich

had no precedence over the poor, nor the distinguished over the obscure, creditors were not above debtors, nor masters above slaves, the times giving equality before the law. Indeed, the life under Saturn, pictured by the poets, no longer appeared to be a fabled story, so great was the prosperity and well-being, the freedom from grief and fear, the joy which pervaded households and people,

<pb n="11"/>

night and day, and lasted continuously without a break through the first seven months.
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="14"><p><milestone unit="para"/>But in the eighth month Gaius was struck down by

severe sickness. He had exchanged the recent more homely and, therefore, healthier way of life which he had followed while Tiberius was alive, for one of extravagance. Hard drinking, luxurious feeding and appetites still unsatisfied when the cavities were stuffed full, hot baths, ill-timed, and acting as emetics, followed at once by renewed toping and gormandizing in its train, lasciviousness venting itself on boys and women, and everything else that can destroy soul and body and the bonds in both which keep them together, joined in the assault. Self-restraint is rewarded by strength and health, incontinence by infirmity and sickness bordering on death.

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="15"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="3"/> The news of Gaius’s illness travelled every-where,

since the time still made navigation possible. For it was the beginning of autumn, the close of the sailing season when the mariners return from then-trading ports everywhere to their own harbours and roadsteads, particularly those who take care not to winter in a foreign country. So people abandoned their luxurious life and became dismal. Every household and city was filled with anxiety and dejection, their recent joy being counter-balanced by a grief no less intense.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="16"><p> For every part of the habitable world

shared his sickness, and theirs was a sickness more grievous than that which overcame him. His was of the body only, theirs was felt by all and everywhere, affecting the well-being of the soul, their peace, their hopes and participation and enjoyment of every good thing.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="17"><p> Thoughts of the many great evils which



<pb n="13"/>

spring from anarchy occupied their mind: famine, war, ravaging, devastation of estates, loss of property, abductions, fears of enslavement and death, so deadly that no physician could cure them and the only remedy lay in the recovery of Gaius.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="18"><p> | So when the

sickness began to abate, in quite a short time it was known even to the inhabitants of the ends of the world, for nothing is more speedy than rumour, and every city was on edge, ever craving for a better report until the good news of his complete recovery was announced by the travellers who arrived. At this every continent, every island, returned once more to its former happiness, for they felt that they personally shared in his preservation.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="19"><p> For no one

remembers any single country or single nation feeling as much delight at the accession or preservation of a ruler, as was felt by the whole world in the case of Gaius, both when he succeeded to the sovereignty and when he recovered from his malady.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="20"><p> They felt

as if they were beginning for the first time to change a nomadic and brutish for a social and gregarious life, or were passing from desolate life in pens and huts on a mountain side to be settled in a walled city, or from an existence unprotected by a guardian, to take their place under a guardian, a shepherd of the civilized flock. Such was their joy but they did not know the truth.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="21"><p> The human mind in its blindness

does not perceive its real interest and all it can do is to take conjecture and guesswork for its guide instead of knowledge.

<milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="4"/> So it was with Gaius.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="22"><p> He who had been

recently regarded as a saviour and benefactor, who would pour new streams of blessings on Asia and Europe, giving happiness indestructible to each singly

<pb n="15"/>

and all in common, at once “ran amuck” as they say,
<note n="10.15.a">Lit. “began from the sacred line.” This line ir the last line of a chessboard, and the actions of anyone who went beyond it would naturally be all” at sea.”</note>
  changing to savagery, or rather revealing the brutality which he used to disguise under the mask of hypocrisy.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="23"><p> His cousin, who had been left to share the

sovereignty and was more entitled by kinship to the succession, since Gaius was the grandson of Tiberius by adoption while the other was by blood, he put to death on the pretext of conspiracy, though his age in itself precluded such an accusation. For the poor youth was just emerging from boyhood into adolescence.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="24"><p> And according to some, if Tiberius had

survived a little longer, Gaius would have been put out of the way, lying as he did under fatally damaging suspicions, and his real grandson would have been appointed sole ruler and heir to his grandfather’s sovereignty.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="25"><p> But Tiberius was snatched away by

fate before he had consummated his plans, while Gaius thought that by strategy he would escape the odium which dereliction in his duty to his partner would excite.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="26"><p> | He employed the following

artifice. Having summoned the chief officials he said,” In accordance with the will of the deceased Tiberius I wish the imperial authority to be shared by him who is my cousin by birth but my brother by affection, though you see yourselves that he is still a mere child and needs guardians and teachers and tutors.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="27"><p> For what greater boon could there be than

that a single soul or body should cease to be laden with the heavy burden of sovereignty and should have one who would be able to relieve and lighten them? And I,” he continued, “will be more than a guardian, a tutor and a teacher. I will appoint


<pb n="17"/>

myself to be his father and him to be my son.”

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="28"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="5"/> With these words he deceived both

the audience and the lad. The adoption was a snare to assure not the sovereignty which he expected, but the loss of that which he held already. And Gaius proceeded to plot against his fellow-heir and true partner with full security and disregard of all opposition, for the Roman laws assign absolute power over the son to the father, not to mention his irresponsible authority as emperor, since no one had either the courage or the power to call him to account for his actions of any kind.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="29"><p> As the victor in the arena throws to the

ground the one remaining champion, so dealt he, without pity for their fellowship in breeding, their kinship or his youth, with this unhappy lad, and sent to an early grave his co-regent, his co-heir who had been expected to be sole emperor as most nearly related to Tiberius, for grandsons when their fathers are dead hold the rank of sons in the eyes of their grandparents.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="30"><p> | It is said, too, that the

boy was ordered to kill himself with his own hands under the superintendence of a centurion and a chiliarch, who had been instructed to take no hand in the sacrilege on the grounds that it was unlawful that the descendants of emperors should be slain by others. For amid his lawless and unsanctified deeds Gaius remembered law and sanctity, a travesty of their true nature. But the lad lacked skill to do the deed, for he had never seen anyone else killed and had not yet been practised in the martial exercises which in view of the imminent prospect of war are used to give preliminary training to those who are being brought up to rule. So at first he stretched out his neck to the emissaries present and bade them

<pb n="19"/>

dispatch him, </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="31"><p>
and when they could not bring themselves

to do it, he took the sword himself and in his ignorance and inexperience asked them what was the most vital spot so that by a well-aimed blow he might break the thread of his miserable life. And they playing the part of preceptors in misery gave their instructions and showed him the part to which he should apply the sword, and having received this first and last lesson he was forced to become his own murderer, poor boy!

<note n="10.19.a">§§ 32–65. For a very short account of Macro’s services to Gaius and his subsequent fall see <hi rend="italic">Flaccus</hi> 12–15.</note>
 When Gaius had won this first and principal

bout and no partner in his sovereignty was still left to divert the allegiance of ill-wishers and suspects, he at once prepared for a second effort, this time against Macro, who had been throughout his ally in establishing his power, not only after he was appointed emperor (for flattery never fails to pay court to success) but also earlier in helping him to get the sovereignty.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="33"><p> For Tiberius, who always acted with

profound prudence and was clever above all his contemporaries in divining a man’s secret wishes, and as much distinguished for shrewdness as for good fortune, often looked on Gaius with disfavour as being ill-disposed to the whole Claudian house and attached only
<note n="10.19.b">As Gaius could claim through his mother, who was the daughter of Julia the daughter of Augustus, descent by birth from Augustus, this might be supposed to weigh with him more than his descent by adoption through his Claudian father Germanicus.</note>
  to his mother’s family, and he feared for his grandson that if he was left alone when young he might be made away with.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="34"><p> Moreover he

doubted his fitness for an office of such magnitude, both because of his unsociable and unfriendly nature and also because of his erratic temperament, for he showed abnormal and crazy tendencies and maintained


<pb n="21"/>

no consistency in word or deed.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="35"><p> These faults

Macro strove with all his might to remedy as opportunity offered and also to eradicate the suspicions of Tiberius on the subject which owing to his ceaseless fear for his grandson seemed to fester most in his mind.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="36"><p> Macro represented him as well-disposed and

docile and so exceedingly devoted to the service of his cousin that family affection would make him willing to retire and leave him sole emperor. Modesty, he said, in many cases was a disadvantage, and it was his modesty which caused the simple-minded Gaius to be considered cunning.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="37"><p> And when

the plausibility of his arguments failed to convince Tiberius he would pledge his credit for their truth. “I guarantee it,” he said, “I have earned the right to be believed. I have given sufficient proof that I am in a special sense a friend of Caesar, a friend of Tiberius, when the task of attacking and destroying Sejanus was placed in my hand.”</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="38"><p> And in general

he was successful with his eulogies of Gaius, if eulogies is a suitable name for the defences directed to meet the vague charges and accusations based on suspicion. For in general the terms in which one might speak in commendation of brothers or sons in the full sense were used in equal or even greater measure of Gaius by Macro, when pleading his cause to Tiberius.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="39"><p> | This was due, according to what most

people said, not merely to the fact that Gaius in return courted the favour of Macro as possessing a predominant and, indeed, all-powerful influence in the government, but to Macro’s wife, though the charge against her was not mentioned. She every day incited and worked upon her husband not to abate his zeal and assistance of the young Gaius.
<note n="10.21.a">According to Dio lviii. 28 and Tac. <hi rend="italic">Ann.</hi> vi. 45, Macro connived at her seduction.</note>


<pb n="23"/>

A wife has great power to paralyse and seduce her husband
<note n="10.23.a">δεῖνον . . . παραλῦσαι read like part of an hexameter.</note>
  and particularly if she is a wanton, for her guilty conscience increases her wheedling.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="40"><p> The

husband, unaware of the corruption of his marriage and household, and thinking that her wheedling is benevolence pure and simple, is deceived and little knows that her artifices are leading him to take his worst enemies to be his dearest friends.

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="41"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="7"/> Knowing then that he had saved Gaius over

and over again when within an ace of destruction, he gave his admonitions frankly and without disguise, for like a good builder he wished his handiwork to remain proof against destruction or dissolution either by himself or another.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="42"><p> So whenever he saw Gaius

asleep at a banquet he would wake him up with the double object of preserving propriety and his personal safety, since a sleeping man is an easy target for conspiracy. Or if he saw him frantic with excitement at the sight of dancers and sometimes joining in the dance, or greeting a mime of scandalous scenes and broad jesting with a loud youngster’s guffaw, instead of a subdued or sedate smile, or fascinated by the music of harpers or choric singers and occasionally accompanying them, he would sit or lean back at his side and nudge him and try to restrain him.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="43"><p> Often,

too, bending down to his ear so that no one else should listen, he would admonish him gently and quietly. “As a spectator,” he would say, “or listener, or using any other of your senses, you ought not to be like those around you or anyone else at all. In every side of life you ought to be as far above these as you have surpassed them in your good


<pb n="25"/>

fortune.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="44"><p> For it is not to be thought of that the

sovereign of earth and sea should be overcome by a song or dancing or ribald jesting or anything of the kind, instead of always and everywhere remembering his sovereignty, that he is as a shepherd and master of a flock, and extracting for himself whatever may tend to betterment from everything whatever that is said or done.”</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="45"><p> Then he would continue, “When

you are attending theatrical or gymnastic competitions or those of the chariot race, do not pay regard to what the performers actually do, but to the moral achievement
<note n="10.25.a">I understand κατόρθωσις as used in the Stoic sense of the moral state which produces κατορθώματα, i.e. τὰ κατ᾿ ἀρετὴν ἐνεργήματα. The virtue in this case is ἀνδρεία, and it is only in so far as the performers showed this that their performance was worth looking at. <hi rend="italic">Cf.</hi> Zeller, <hi rend="italic">Stoics</hi> (Eng. trans.), p. 248.</note>
  shown in their doings, and reason thus with yourself.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="46"><p> If there are those who so labour on

things which do not profit human life but merely provide pleasure and enjoyment to the spectator, so that they win praise and admiration and rewards and honours and crowns announced by proclamations, what should he do who has learnt the highest and greatest art?</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="47"><p> And the best and greatest art is the art of

government which causes the good deep soil in lowlands and highlands to be tilled, and all the seas to be safely navigated by merchantships laden with cargoes to effect the exchange of goods which the countries in desire for fellowship render to each other, receiving those which they lack and sending in return those of which they carry a surplus.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="48"><p> For envy has

never gained the mastery over the habitable world, nor even of the great sections of it, the whole of Europe or the whole of Asia. But like a venomous reptile it creeps into tiny hiding-places, into a single man or a single house or, if the force of its blast be


<pb n="27"/>

overstrong, into a single city. But to the wider circuit of a nation or country it has no entry, particularly since your family, the truly Augustan, began to hold sway over all and everywhere.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="49"><p> For

all the mischiefs which used to prosper and occupy a central place have been driven by your house into exile and into the utmost corners and recesses of Tartarus, and things beneficial and profitable which lay as though in banishment it has brought back from the ends of the earth and sea into the world of our habitation. The governance of all these has been entrusted to your single hand.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="50"><p> Accordingly

having under Nature’s escort risen to the highest post in the stern, and the tiller placed in your hand, steer in security the common ship of mankind, rejoicing and delighting in nothing so much as in benefiting your subjects.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="51"><p> For various are the contributions

which private citizens throughout the cities render under compulsion, but the fittest contribution for a ruler is to put forth good proposals for the benefit of his subjects and to execute these proposals in the best way possible and to bring forth good gifts with a bountiful hand and will, reserving nothing save what in provision for the uncertainty of the future may fitly be stored in safe-keeping.”

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="52"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="8"/> With such talk the unfortunate man tried to

charm Gaius into better ways. But quarrelsome and contentious as he was, he let his inclination turn to the opposite direction as though it was that to which Macro urged him.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="53"><p> And he grew bold enough to flout his monitor outright, and sometimes when he saw him coming a little way off he would discourse thus to the bystanders, “Here comes the teacher of

one who no longer needs to learn, the tutor of one who

veracious, not knowing the deceptive and cunning character of the speaker, for his artificial and cunning disposition was not yet manifest. However a few days later the unhappy man together with his wife was got rid of and paid the extreme penalty in return for his excessive zeal.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="60"><p> This is the gratitude

gained by benefits bestowed on the ungrateful. They return the benefits they have received by inflicting the severest penalties on their benefactors.

  blow of still more grievous treachery. He had for his father-in-law M. Silanus, a man with plenty of fine spirit and of distinguished family. His daughter died early but he continued to pay the same attentions to Gaius and showed him an affection suited not so much to a father-in-law as to an actual father, thinking that by thus converting his son-in-law into a son he would have it reciprocated by the rule of equality. But he little knew how false and deceptive was his expectation.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="63"><p> In all his discourse he talked as a

guardian, concealing nothing which might tend to improve and benefit Gaius’s character, conduct and government. He had, indeed, strong inducements to speak freely in his pre-eminently noble lineage and his close connexion by marriage.

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="64"><p> But Gaius took his admonitions as an insult since he

on the successive murders of the foremost men. And so in every mouth there was common talk about these inexpiable abominations, though quietly and in undertones, since fear prevented open discussion.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="67"><p> Then there was a reaction, for a multitude is unstable

in everything, intentions, words and deeds. They could not believe that Gaius, who but now had been thought kind and humane, showing fairness and fellowship to all, had undergone at once so complete a change. They began to look for arguments of defence and by close search found them. Of his own cousin and fellow-heir they would talk thus.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="68"><p> “Sovereignty cannot be shared, that is an immutable

law of nature. He being the stronger promptly did to the weaker what the weaker would have done to him. This is defence, not murder. Perhaps, too, it was providential and for the benefit of all mankind, that the lad was put out of the way, since some would have been partisans of him and others of Gaius, and it is such things that create disturbances and wars both civil and foreign. And what is better than peace? But peace springs from right government. The only right government is that which is free from disputes and factions which also causes everything else to be carried on aright.”</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="69"><p> | Of Macro they said, “His pride extended beyond

reasonable limits, he did not read well the Delphic motto ‘Know thyself.’ It is a common saying that knowledge is the source of happiness and ignorance of unhappiness. What reason had he for reversing his part and transferring the subject to the rank of ruler, and Gaius, the emperor, to the place of a subject? To command, which is what he did, befits best the sovereign, and to obey, which is what

<pb n="37"/>

he deemed Gaius should submit to, befits the subject.”</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="70"><p> For in their thoughtlessness they gave the

name of commanding to exhortation and of the ruler to the counsellor, whether they misunderstood the matter through stupidity, or in flattery recast the words and the things signified by them away from their natural use.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="71"><p> | Of Silanus, “He was

under a ridiculous delusion in thinking that a father-in-law had the same influence over a son-in-law as a real father has over his son, though, indeed, in private life fathers whose sons have obtained high offices and posts of authority waive their claims and are content to take the second place. But this silly man even though he had ceased to be a father-in-law extended his activities beyond his sphere and did not understand that the death of his daughter carried with it the death of the matrimonial affinity.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="72"><p> For inter-marriage

is a lien between unconnected households bringing the status of stranger into one of affinity, and if this be broken the community of interests is broken also, particularly if the break is caused by an irretrievable event, the death of her whose admission to a house not her own rested on her marriage.”</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="73"><p> Such were the ideas on which they dwelt in all their

talks, and what principally weighed with them was their wish to think that the emperor was not cruel. For as they had hoped that kindness and humanity were established in his soul in a greater degree than in any of his predecessors they thought it very incredible that he had undergone all at once so complete a change to the reverse.

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="74"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="11"/> Gaius had thus won the three contests de-scribed

above in three vitally important departments. Two of these, the Senate and the Equestrian Order,

<pb n="39"/>

concerned his relations to his Capital; the third was his family life.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="75"><p> So supposing that by his victory over the strongest and most powerful personages he had inspired all the rest with abject fear, the senators by the murder of Silanus who was

second to none of the members of that body, the knights by the death of Macro who had become like the leader of a chorus and stood first in honours and reputation among them, and all his blood relations by the death of his cousin and fellow-heir, he no longer considered it worthy of him to abide within the bounds of human nature but overstepped them in his eagerness to be thought a god.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="76"><p> | In the

first stage of this infatuation he is said to have taken this line of argument. “Those who have charge of the herds of other animals, ox herds, goat herds, shepherds, are not themselves oxen, nor goats nor lambs, but men to whom is given a higher destiny and constitution, and in the same way I who am in charge of the best of herds, mankind, must be considered to be different from them and not of human nature but to have a greater and diviner destiny.”</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="77"><p> | This conception he had firmly sealed

in his mind and carried about with him, poor fool, a mythical fiction as if it was an indisputable truth. And when once he had gained courage and was emboldened to publish to the multitude his most godless assumption of godship he tried to make his actions correspond and harmonize with it and gradually as if on stepping-stones advanced to the top.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="78"><p> | For he began first of all to

liken himself to the so-called demigods, Dionysus and Heracles and the Dioscuri, treating Trophonius and Amphiaraus and Amphilochus and their like and their

oracles and celebrations as laughing-stocks compared with his own power.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="79"><p> Then, as in a theatre, he assumed

different costumes at different times, sometimes the lion skin and club, both overlaid with gold, to adorn himself as Heracles, sometimes caps on his head when he made himself up as the Dioscuri, or again as Dionysus with ivy, thyrsus and fawn’s skin.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="80"><p>
<note n="10.41.a">According to Dio lix. 26, he also impersonated goddesses: Hera, Aphrodite and Artemis.</note>
  | And he thought it fit to differ from these in that

while each of them held to his own honours and did not lay claim to those which were shared by others, he, filled with envy and covetousness, took possession wholesale of the honours of them all, or rather of the deities themselves. He did not convert himself into a triple-bodied Geryon to bewilder the spectators by the multiplication, but performed a feat which could be least expected by remodelling and recasting what was nothing but a single body into manifold forms, like the Egyptian Proteus whom Homer represented as admitting every kind of transfiguration both into the elements and into the animals and plants of which they are the components.

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="85"><p> For having before his eyes the endless ages

and reflecting that while he lived for ever his brother would be dead for ever and his mourning for him would be as everlasting as his own existence, he achieved a great and marvellous reciprocation in that he mingled mortality with his own lot and indestructibility with his brother’s, and thus made inequality, the source of injustice, vanish in equality, which is the fountain of justice.

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="155"><p>

He was aware that the great section of Rome on the other side of the Tiber is occupied and inhabited by Jews, most of whom were Roman citizens emancipated. For having been brought as captives to Italy they were liberated by their owners and were not forced to violate any of their native institutions.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="156"><p> He knew therefore that they have houses of prayer

and meet together in them, particularly on the sacred sabbaths when they receive as a body a training in their ancestral philosophy. He knew too that they collect money for sacred purposes from their first-fruits and send them to Jerusalem by persons who

would offer the sacrifices.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="157"><p> Yet nevertheless he

neither ejected them from Rome nor deprived them of their Roman citizenship because they were careful to preserve their Jewish citizenship also, nor took any violent measures against the houses of prayer, nor prevented them from meeting to receive instructions in the laws, nor opposed their offerings of the first-fruits. Indeed so religiously did he respect our interests that supported by wellnigh his whole household he adorned our temple through the costliness of his dedications, and ordered that for all time continuous sacrifices of whole burnt offerings should be carried out every day at his own expense as a tribute to the most high God. And these sacrifices are maintained to the present day and will be maintained for ever to tell the story of a character truly imperial.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="158"><p> Yet more, in the monthly doles in his own city when

all the people each in turn receive money or corn, he never put the Jews at a disadvantage in sharing the bounty, but even if the distributions happened to come during the sabbath when no one is permitted to receive or give anything or to transact any part of the business of ordinary life, particularly of a lucrative kind, he ordered the dispensers to reserve for the Jews till the morrow the charity which fell to all.

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="165"><p> Then again he thought that the

violent proceedings against the meeting-houses had sprung from a clear conscience and from a sincere desire to do him honour. This impression was due partly to the attention he paid to the periodical notifications which were sent at the instance of some persons in Alexandria and made very pleasing reading for him, so much so that in comparison with their charm the works of others either in prose or poetry seemed to him very distasteful.

letting out every reef like sailors with a fair wind at the stern, he was carried along at full sail racing before the breeze, while he assembled a string of indictments one after the other. And the impression made on Gaius’s mind grew firmer so that his memory of the charges was ineffaceable.

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="178"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="28"/> In these straits and difficulties, since

while leaving no stone unturned to propitiate Helicon we found no way open, as no one dared to address or approach him because of the arrogance and harshness he showed to all, and also we did not know whether in always inciting and working up his master against the nation he was influenced by a personal dislike of the Jewish race, we ceased to exert ourselves in this direction and confined our efforts to the more pressing side. We determined to give Gaius a document presenting in a summarized form the story of our sufferings and our claims.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="179"><p> This document was practically

an epitome of a longer supplication which we had sent to him a short time before through the hands

of King Agrippa.
<note n="10.93.a">This document of course was quite different from the complimentary address mentioned in <hi rend="italic">Flaccus</hi> 103 as sent in duplicate through Agrippa. The statement made here seems to me to raise considerable difficulty. The natural meaning is that it was handed to Agrippa at his visit to Alexandria in the spring of 38. That the Jews might have given him a petition setting forth their rights, i.e. their claims to citizenship, is possible enough, and as circumstances had not changed this, this petition might have been adequate later. But it also is said to have set forth their sufferings, i.e. the persecutions and the desecration of the synagogues, and these could not have been described in a document handed to Agrippa during this visit, for it is impossible to suppose that he remained at Alexandria through the pogrom which culminated at the end of August.

I expect that his idea of a lacuna at this point in ch. xxvhi. is a later modification. I see no reasons for supposing lacunas on any such grounds. See Introd. pp. xxii. But it is true that a few words to the effect that Agrippa’s visit had led to intimacy with him might have cleared up the difficulty mentioned in the preceding note.</note>

I believe myself in virtue of my age and my good education otherwise to possess a greater amount of good sense, what gave joy to the others rather alarmed me.

For he must have known that we were Jews who would be contented if they were not treated worse than others.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="183"><p> To suppose that we shall take precedence with a

despot of an alien race, a young man possessing absolute power, surely borders on madness; it looks as if he is attaching himself to the party of the other Alexandrians and it was to them that he gave precedence and promised to give judgement quickly, if indeed he has not discarded the idea of giving a fair and impartial hearing and instead of a judge become their advocate and our opponent.”

had no rest by day or night. But while in my despondency I kept my affliction concealed since it was not safe to let it appear, another very heavy calamity was suddenly and unexpectedly launched upon us, which endangered not one part only of the Jewish race but the whole body of the nation. We 185 had travelled from Rome to Puteoli following Gaius, who had come down to the sea side and was spending some time round the bay passing from one to another of the numerous and expensively furnished country houses which he owned.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="186"><p> While we were anxiously

considering the statement of our case, since we were always expecting to be summoned, there came to us one with a troubled look in his bloodshot eyes and

gasping convulsively. He drew us a little way apart since there were some people standing near and said, “Have you heard the new tidings? “and when he was going to report it he was brought up short, as a flood of tears streamed from his eyes.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="187"><p> He began

Philo and his colleagues had three courses of action before them. First they might proceed with their suit, perhaps by sending the document mentioned in § 178 if that had not been sent already. This was impracticable as far as the synagogue question was concerned and might probably cost them their lives (§ 191).

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="197"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="30"/> Thus we talked on, at once lamenting



<pb n="103"/>

our unexpected misfortunes and comforting ourselves with a hope of a change to serener conditions. Then pausing for a little we said to those who had brought the news, “Why do you sit here silently merely implanting in our ears the sparks to light the fire by which we are consumed, instead of proceeding to tell us the causes which have moved Gaius to do this?” </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="198"><p>They replied, “You know the chief and

primary cause which all men also know. He wishes to be thought a god and has supposed that the only dissentients will be the Jews on whom he could inflict no greater injury than the ruin of the sanctity of their temple. He has been instructed that of all the temples anywhere it is the most beautiful, ever from endless ages embellished by ceaseless and unsparing expenditure. Quarrelsome and contentious as he is, he proposes to appropriate it for his own use.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="199"><p> | But now his eagerness has become


keener than ever before owing to a letter sent to him by Capito. Capito is the tax-collector for Judaea and cherishes a spite against the population. When he came there he was a poor man but by his rapacity and peculation he has amassed much wealth in various forms. Then fearing that some accusation might be brought against him he devised a scheme to elude the charges by slandering those whom he had wronged.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="200"><p> It chanced that an opportunity for obtaining

his object was given by the following incident. Jamneia, one of the most populous cities of Judaea, is inhabited by a mixture of people, the majority being Jews with some others of alien races, intruders for mischief from the dwellers in adjacent countries. These people being new settlers have made themselves a pest and a nuisance to those who are in a

<pb n="105"/>

sense indigenous by perpetually subverting some part of the institutions of the Jews.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="201"><p> Hearing from travellers

visiting them how earnestly Gaius was pressing his deification and the extreme hostility which he felt towards the whole Jewish race, they thought that a fit opportunity of attacking them had fallen in their way. Accordingly they erected an extemporized altar of the commonest material with the clay moulded into bricks, merely as a plan to injure their neighbours, for they knew that they would not allow their customs to be subverted, as indeed it turned out.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="202"><p> For, when they saw it and felt it intolerable

that the sanctity which truly belongs to the Holy Land should be destroyed, they met together and pulled it down. The others at once went off to Capito, who was the author of the whole episode, and he, thinking that he had found a piece of luck which he had long been seeking, wrote to Gaius a highly exaggerated account of the facts.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="203"><p> | Gaius


after reading it gave orders that in place of the altar of bricks erected in wanton spite in Jamneia something richer and more magnificent, namely a colossal statue coated with gold, should be set up in the temple of the mother city. In this he followed the advice of those excellent and sapient advisers, that member of the aristocracy Helicon, slave, scrap retailer, piece of riff-raff, and one Apelles
<note n="10.105.a"><hi rend="italic">Cf.</hi> Suet. <hi rend="italic">Gaius</hi> 33 and Dio lix. 5.</note>
  a tragic actor, who, they say, in the flower of his prime had trafficked his youthful charms, but when the bloom was passed went on to the stage.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="204"><p> Of course performers on the stage

whose trade is with theatres and theatre-goers are lovers of modesty and sobriety, not of shamelessness and extreme indecency. The reason why Apelles


<pb n="107"/>

was advanced to the post of councillor was that Gaius might take advice on the right method of jesting from one and of chanting from the other, having set aside all consideration for the general welfare by which peace and tranquillity of every thing in every place might be maintained.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="205"><p> So then Helicon, scorpion

in form of a slave, vented his Egyptian venom on the Jews and so too Apelles with the venom of Ascalon. For that was the place he came from, and the Ascalonites have a truceless and irreconcilable hostility to the Jewish inhabitants of the Holy Land on whose borders they live.”</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="206"><p> As we heard this every single

word was a wound to our souls. But shortly afterwards these admirable advisers of admirable actions received the reward of their impiety. Apelles for other reasons was thrown by Gaius into chains of iron and tortured by the rack and the wheel in turns
<note n="10.107.a">Or “periodically” (rack and wheel being regarded as a single process), which suits the figure of recurrent fevers better.</note>
  like people suffering from recurring fevers. Helicon was put to death by Claudius Germanicus Caesar for the other wrongs which the madman had committed. But these events belong to a later time.

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="207"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="31"/> Gaius’s letter enjoining the dedication of

the statue was written not in simple terms but with all circumspection possible to ensure safety. He ordered his viceroy for the whole of Syria, Petronius, to whom the letter was addressed, to bring for the conduct of the statue to Judaea half the army quartered on the Euphrates to guard the passage against the kings and nations of the east. This was done not to add dignity to the dedication but to effect the immediate destruction of anyone who tried to prevent it.

<pb n="109"/>
What mean you by this, my lord and master?</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="208"><p> is it

an act of war based on the foreknowledge that they would not submit but would take up arms to defend the laws and die for their national institutions? For surely it was not done in ignorance of the probable results of any attempt to violate the temple. No, you foresaw what would take place as clearly as if it were already present and the future events as though they were already in hand, and so you ordered the army to be brought in that the first sacrifice with which the image was consecrated might be polluted with the massacre of unhappy men and women alike.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="209"><p> | Petronius having


read the instructions was in great difficulties. Fear made it impossible for him to oppose the order, for he knew that Gaius crushed irresistibly not only those who did not carry out his command but also those who did not do so at once. Neither could he lightly undertake it, for he knew that the Jews would willingly endure to die not once but a thousand times, if it were possible, rather than allow any of the prohibited actions to be committed.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="210"><p> For all men guard their own customs, but this is

especially true of the Jewish nation. Holding that the laws are oracles vouchsafed by God and having been trained in this doctrine from their earliest years, they carry the likenesses of the commandments enshrined in their souls.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="211"><p> Then as they contemplate

their forms thus clearly represented they always think of them with awe. And those of other races who pay homage to them they welcome no less than their own countrymen, while those who either break them down or mock at them they hate as their bitterest foes. And such dread is inspired by each of the pronouncements

<pb n="111"/>

that they would never purchase what men deem good fortune or happiness, whichever name is right, by transgressing even in the slightest matters.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="212"><p> Still more abounding and peculiar is the

zeal of them all for the temple, and the strongest proof of this is that death without appeal is the sentence against those of other races who penetrate into its inner confines. For the outer are open to everyone wherever they come from.
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="213"><p><milestone unit="para"/>Having these things before his eyes Petronius was

slow to set to work. He saw the audacity of so vast an enterprise, and having mustered all the reasoning faculties of his soul, as though in a council, he looked to see what verdict they gave, and found it unanimous against destroying anything which was held sacred from the beginning, primarily from a feeling of natural justice and piety, secondly from the danger threatened not only from God but from the victims of the outrage.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="214"><p> | He bethought him of the


vast number of people comprised in the nation, which needed to contain it not like every other the circumference of a single country allotted to itself alone, but, one might almost say, the whole habitable world. For it is spread abroad over all the continents and islands so that it seems to be not much less than the indigenous inhabitants.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="215"><p> To draw all these myriads

into war against him was surely very dangerous. Heaven forbid indeed that the Jews in every quarter should come by common agreement to the defence. The result would be something too stupendous to be combated.
<note n="10.111.a">χρῆμα is used in the idiomatic sense of something big, of which ὑὸς χρῆμα μέγα is the stock example.</note>
  But without this the inhabitants of Judea are unlimited in number. Their bodies are


<pb n="113"/>

of the finest quality and their souls of the highest courage, preferring to die in defence of their national institutions, moved by a high spirit not as some of their slanderers would say barbaric but in very truth worthy of the free and nobly born.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="216"><p> He was frightened

also by the forces beyond the Euphrates, since that Babylon and many other satrapies were occupied by Jews was known to him not only by report but by experience. For every year envoys were dispatched for the sacred purpose of conveying to the temple a great quantity of gold and silver amassed from the firstfruits, and these envoys travel over the pathless, trackless, endless routes which seem to them good highroads because they feel that they lead them to piety.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="217"><p> So he was naturally much alarmed lest hearing

of this unprecedented dedication the Jews of those parts might suddenly take to raiding, and coming from different quarters might encircle his troops and joining hands attack them now isolated in their midst with terrible effect. While following this line of reasoning he shrank from action. |
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="218"><p>Then again he was drawn in the opposite direction

by counter-arguments. “The order,” he said, “is given by a master who is young and judges that whatever he wishes is beneficial and that what he has once decreed is as good as accomplished, be it ever so unprofitable and charged with contentiousness and arrogance. For he has soared above man’s estate and already ranks himself as among the gods. My life is in imminent danger whether I oppose or give way, but while if I give way the danger is the prospect of war the result of which is doubtful, and there is no certainty that it will happen at all, if I oppose, its source is Gaius and it admits of no appeal and no

<pb n="115"/>

denial.”</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="219"><p> This latter view was supported by many

Romans who shared his administration of Syria, since they knew that the wrath and vengeance of Gaius would reach them first as accomplices in making his orders of none effect.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="220"><p> An opportunity for a respite

to take a closer consideration was afforded by the constructing of the statue. For Gaius had not had one sent from Rome, in my opinion through the providence of God, who unseen by us stretched out his hand to protect the wronged, nor did he command Petronius to select from the statues in Syria the one approved of as best and send it to Jerusalem. For speed in the execution of his unlawful purpose would have led to a speedy outburst of war.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="221"><p> So Petronius

having got an opportunity for consideration of the best course to adopt, since great and sudden emergencies when they fall with concentrated force crush the reasoning faculty, ordered the construction to be carried out in some one of the adjacent countries
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="222"><p>
and accordingly sent for the most clever craftsmen

to be found in Phoenicia and gave them the material which they worked up in Sidon. | He also
sent for the magnates of the Jews, priests and magistrates, partly to explain Gaius’s intentions and partly to advise them to accept the orders of their lord and master and keep before their eyes the dire consequences of doing otherwise. For, as he told them, the more efficient part of the armed forces in Syria



<pb n="117"/>

were ready at hand and would strew the land with the dead.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="223"><p> For he thought that if he could start by

appeasing them he could use them to instruct all the rest of the population to abstain from opposition. But he failed as might be expected to effect his intention.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="224"><p> Smitten by his first words, we are told, as soon as they heard the story of the abnormal calamity they stood riveted to the ground, incapable of speech, and then while a flood of tears poured from their eyes as from fountains they plucked the hair from their beards and heads and finally uttered such words as these, “Did we too fortunate

pay so much to purchase a long and happy life,

  only to behold what none of our forefathers saw in the past? How can our eyes bear it? they shall be torn out and with them the miseries of life, the anguish of our existence, before they look on such a calamity—a sight unfit for them to see, unlawful for the ears to hear, or the mind to imagine.”

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="225"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="32"/> While they were thus lamenting, the

inhabitants of the holy city and the rest of the country hearing what was afoot marshalled themselves as if at a single signal, the signal which their common situation gave them, and issued forth in a body leaving cities, villages and houses empty and in one onrush sped to Phoenicia where Petronius chanced to be.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="226"><p> Some of his people seeing a vast

crowd moving along ran to his aid and made their report in order that he might take precautions


<pb n="119"/>

against the war which they expected. They had not finished their story and Petronius still remained unguarded, when the multitude of the Jews suddenly descended like a cloud and occupied the whole of Phoenicia to the profound astonishment of those who did not know how populous the nation was.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="227"><p> The first thing to be observed was the great shouting

which arose mingled with weeping and smiting of breasts, so great that it was more than the ears of those present could contain. For even when they paused there was no pausing in the sound but it still echoed even amid their silence. The next step was to approach Petronius and make such supplications as the occasion suggested, for great misfortunes themselves teach men what their situation is. They were divided into six companies, old men, young men, boys, and again in their turn old women, grown women, maidens.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="228"><p> When Petronius

first appeared in the distance all the companies as though at a word of command fell before him to the ground uttering a dirge-like wail with cries of supplication. When he encouraged them to rise and come nearer, they rose with some reluctance and with dust poured all over them, their eyes streaming with tears and both hands set behind them as though they were pinioned, they approached him.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="229"><p> Then the body

of elders stood and spoke as follows, “We are unarmed as you see, though some accuse us of having come as enemies in war, yet the parts which nature has assigned to each of us for defence, our hands, we have put away where they can do nothing and present our bodies as an easy target for the missiles of those who wish to kill us.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="230"><p> We have brought our

  to you, leaving none at home, and have prostrated outselves before Gaius in doing so to you, that you and he may either save us all from ruin or send us all to perish in utter destruction. O Petronius, both by our nature and our principles we are peaceable, and the diligence which parents devote to rearing their children has trained us in this practice from the very first.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="231"><p> When

Gaius succeeded to the sovereignty we were the first of all the inhabitants of Syria to show our joy, for Vitellius your predecessor as governor was staying in the city, and it was to him that the letter telling the news was sent and it was from our city that rumour to carry the good tidings sped to the others.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="232"><p> Was our temple the first to accept sacrifices in behalf

of Gaius’s reign only that it should be the first or even the only one to be robbed of its ancestral tradition of worship? We are evacuating our cities, withdrawing from our houses and lands; our furniture and money and cherished possessions and all the other spoil we will willingly make over. We should think ourselves gainers thereby, not givers. One thing only we ask in return for all, that no violent changes should be made in this temple and that it be kept as we received it from our grandparents and ancestors.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="233"><p> But if we cannot persuade you, we give up ourselves

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="240"><p> It may be that by this

mission we shall persuade him, pleading in full either the honour due to God or the preservation of our laws undestroyed, or our right to be no worse treated than all the nations, even those in the uttermost regions, who have had their ancestral institutions maintained, or the decisions of his grandfather and great-grandfather in which they ratified our customs with all respect for them.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="241"><p> Perhaps

when he hears this he will be softened. The judgements of the great do not remain unchanged; if they have been made in anger they soonest lose their strength. We have been slandered, permit us to purge the slanders; it is a grievous thing to be condemned untried.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="242"><p> But if we fail to persuade him

what remains to hinder you from carrying out your present intention?

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="243"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="33"/> This appeal was made in great agitation

and intense emotion accompanied with much gasping

<pb n="127"/>

and spasmodic breathing, the sweat streaming over every limb amid a flood of ceaseless tears, so that by now their hearers shared their sorrow, and Petronius who was naturally kindly was quite carried away both by what he heard and what he saw. For he felt that what they said was very just and that the emotion displayed in what he saw was worthy of pity.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="244"><p> He rose and retiring deliberated with his

fellow-councillors on the course to be taken. He saw that those who had just before been entirely opposed to the Jews were wavering, and that the doubters had thrown most of their weight into the scale of mercy. This pleased him though he knew the nature of his chief and how implacable was his anger.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="245"><p> Indeed

it appears that he himself had some rudiments of Jewish philosophy and religion acquired either in early lessons in the past through his zeal for culture or after his appointment as governor in the countries where the Jews are very numerous in every city, Asia and Syria, or else because his soul was so disposed, being drawn to things worthy of serious effort by a nature which listened to no voice nor dictation nor teaching but its own. But we find that to good men God whispers
<note n="10.127.a">Or “suggests.” For Philo’s frequent use of ὑπηχεῖν, generally carrying with it the idea of a voice heard in-</note>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="246"><p> He would not press

the craftsmen but would urge them to perfect the statue with good artistry and aim as far as possible to take a long time to reach the standard of the widely known exemplars, since work, if perfunctory, is generally

short-lived and to have it executed with pains and knowledge requires a long time.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="247"><p> He would

not grant their request for an embassy. It was not safe. He would not oppose those who wished to lay the matter before the ruler and master of them all, but to the general multitude he would express neither assent nor denial, as both were dangerous.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="248"><p> He would send to Gaius a letter in

which, without accusing the Jews or giving a candid account of their prayers and entreaties, he would charge the delay in the installation partly to the work requiring a definite allowance of time for the construction, partly to the season, which gave strong grounds for delay, the reasonableness of which Gaius himself not only might but necessarily must admit.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="249"><p> For the wheat crop was just ripe and

so were the other cereals, and he feared that the Jews in despair for their ancestral rites and in scorn of life might lay waste the arable land or set fire to the cornlands on the hills and the plain. He needed a guard to insure more vigilance in gathering the fruits not only of the cornfields but also those provided by the orchards.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="250"><p> For Gaius had determined,

they were told, to sail to Alexandria by Egypt, but so great a potentate would not think it right to go by the open sea because of the dangers and the numbers of ships required for a convoy, and also the need of providing for his bodily comfort, all which ends are easily obtained by taking the circuitous route along Asia and Syria.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="251"><p> For he would be able every

day to combine the voyage with landing, particularly as most of the vessels which he would take would be not merchant ships but warships for which coasting is more feasible, just as an open sea voyage is for

<pb n="131"/>

cargo boats.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="252"><p> It would be necessary therefore to have

fodder for the beasts and a vast stock of food got ready in all the cities of Syria, particularly on the coast. For a huge crowd would come both by sea and by land, drawn not only from Rome itself and Italy, but also from the successive provinces right up to Syria, a crowd composed partly of persons of high rank, partly of soldiers, infantry and cavalry and marines, while the multitude of servants would be not less than the military.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="253"><p> Supplies were needed

calculated not merely for absolute necessities but for the excessive expenditure which Gaius demanded. If he reads this letter, thought Petronius, he will probably not merely refrain from anger but approve our forethought, recognizing that the postponement which we have made is not due to favouritism to the Jews but in order to insure the carrying of the harvest.

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="254"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="34"/> As his fellow-councillors approved of his

policy he ordered the letters to be written, and appointed to carry them persons who were active travellers and also knew how to make short cuts in their journey. When they arrived they delivered the letter, but Gaius while he was still reading was fuming and was filled with wrath as he noted each point.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="255"><p> When he stopped reading he smote his hands together

and said, “Good, Petronius, you have not learnt to hearken to an emperor; your successive offices have puffed you with pride. Up to this time you seem to have no knowledge of Gaius even by report; you will soon know him by actual experience.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="256"><p> You concern

yourself with the institutions of the Jews, the nation which is my worst enemy; you disregard the imperial commands of your sovereign. You feared their great numbers. Then had you not with you the military

forces which are feared by the nations of the east and their rulers the Parthians?</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="257"><p> Oh but you had

compassion! Then did pity weigh more than Gaius with you? Go on, plead the harvest as your pretext; the harvest for which no pretext will avail will soon be visited on your own head. Yes, lay the blame on the ingathering of the fruits and the preparations needed for our journey. Why, even if complete barrenness reigned in Judaea were not the neighbouring countries so many and so prosperous capable of providing the necessaries and compensating the deficiency in one?</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="258"><p> But why should I not sit still till

my hands get to work? why should any people know my intentions beforehand? he who is to reap the reward, let him know of it before others through personal experience.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="259"><p> I stop speaking, but I shall not stop thinking.’’ | After waiting a short

time he gave one of his secretaries instructions about answering Petronius. In these he seemingly praised him for his forethought and his careful exploration of future requirements. For he greatly feared the holders of governorships, he saw that they had resources ready for an uprising, particularly those who had large provinces and commanded large armies of the size of those in Syria on the Euphrates.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="260"><p> So his

language and letters were ingratiating, and though furiously angry he disguised his rancour waiting for an opportunity. Then he concluded his letter by bidding him interest himself in nothing so much as in hastening the installation of the statue, since the harvest which he alleged as an excuse, whether truly or plausibly, could already have been carried.

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="261"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="35"/> Not long afterwards King Agrippa appeared

to pay his wonted respects to Gaius. Now he

<pb n="135"/>

knew absolutely nothing about the contents of the letter sent by Petronius or of those written earlier and later by Gaius. He judged however by his irregular movements and the disturbance shown in his eyes that anger was smouldering beneath, and he examined and searched himself in every way, setting his reason to work in every direction and on every possibility small or great, to see whether he had done or said something which he should not.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="262"><p> But when he could

find nothing at all he conjectured naturally enough that Gaius was exasperated by some other persons, but again when he saw him frowning and that his eyes had been fixed on no one else in the company but himself alone, he was frightened and though he was often minded to question him he forbore, reasoning thus:</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="263"><p> “Perhaps I shall draw upon myself the menace directed to others and have officiousness, rashness and effrontery imputed to me.“Gaius, who

was skilled in discerning a man’s secret wishes and feelings from his open countenance, observed his agitation and perplexity and said, “You are perplexed, Agrippa, I will release you from your perplexity.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="264"><p> Have you sojourned with me all this time and

not learnt that I speak not only with my voice but quite as much with my eyes in every intimation that I make?</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="265"><p> Your excellent and worthy fellow-citizens,

who alone of every race of men do not acknowledge Gaius as a god, appear to be courting even death by their recalcitrance. When I ordered a statue of Zeus to be set up in the temple they marshalled their whole population and issued forth from the city and country nominally to make a petition but actually to counteract my orders.”</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="266"><p> He was about to add

further charges when Agrippa in deep distress turned

<pb n="137"/>

to every kind of colour, blood-red, dead pale and livid all in a moment.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="267"><p> And by now from the crown of his

head to his feet he was mastered by a fit of shuddering, every part and every limb convulsed with trembling and palpitation. With his nervous system relaxed and unbraced he was in a state of utter collapse, and finally thus paralysed was on the point of falling. But some of the bystanders caught him and, when ordered to bring him home, took him thither on a stretcher, quite unconscious in his coma of the mass of troubles which had fallen upon him.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="268"><p> | Gaius indeed was still more exasperated

and pushed his hatred of the nation still further. “If Agrippa,” he said, “who is my dearest and most familiar friend and bound to me by so many benefactions, is so under the dominion of its customs that he cannot even bear to hear a word against them and is prostrated almost to the point of death, what must we expect of the others who are not under the influence of any counter-acting force?” </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="269"><p>On the other hand Agrippa for the first

day and the greater part of the next lay sunk in profound coma and knew nothing of what went on. But about the late afternoon he lifted his head slightly and just managed to open his eyes a little, weary as they were, and with their dim and misty vision cast a half look on those around him, unable as yet to distinguish clearly their several forms.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="270"><p> Then again

he dropped off into sleep and rested quietly in a healthier condition than before, as far as could be judged from his revival and the state of his body.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="271"><p> Afterwards he woke up and asked, “Where am I

now? At Gaius’s? is my lord also present?” They replied, “Cheer up, you are staying in your

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="275"><p> Tearfully he

forced himself to swallow some food without anything to season it, and even refused the offer of a mixed drink, and merely took a taste of water instead. “The belly,” he said, “poor creature, has been paid in full the debt which it claimed.

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="276"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="36"/> He took a tablet and wrote to him as

follows: “My opportunity, my master, of interceding with you face to face has been lost through fear and reverend shame, fear which could not confront the menace, reverence which struck me dumb before the greatness of your dignity. But

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="277"><p> All men, my emperor, have planted in

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="278"><p> I as you know am by birth a Jew, and my

native city is Jerusalem in which is situated the sacred shrine of the most high God. It fell to me to have for my grandparents and ancestors kings, most of whom had the title of high priest, who considered their kingship inferior to the priesthood, holding that the office of high priest is as superior in excellence to that of king as God surpasses men. For the office of one is to worship God, of the other to have charge of men.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="279"><p> As my lot is

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="280"><p> For in all

matters in which piety is enjoined and permitted under the laws it stood not a whit behind any other either in Asia or in Europe, in its prayers, its erection of votive offerings, its number of sacrifices, not only of those offered at general national feasts but in the perpetual and daily rites through which is declared their piety, not so much with mouth and tongue as in intentions formed in the secrecy of the soul by those

who do not tell you that they love their Caesar but love him in very truth.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="281"><p>  As for the holy

city, I must say what befits me to say. While she, as I have said, is my native city she is also the mother city not of one country Judaea but of most of the others in virtue of the colonies sent out at divers times to the neighbouring lands Egypt, Phoenicia, the part of Syria called the Hollow and the rest as well and the lands lying far apart, Pamphylia, Cilicia, most of Asia up to Bithynia and the corners of Pontus, similarly also into Europe, Thessaly, Boeotia, Macedonia, Aetolia, Attica, Argos, Corinth and most of the best parts of Peloponnese.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="282"><p> And not only are

the mainlands full of Jewish colonies but also the most highly esteemed of the islands Euboea, Cyprus, Crete. I say nothing of the countries beyond the Euphrates, for except for a small part they all, Babylon and of the other satrapies those where the land within their confines

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="284"><p> It well befits the magnitude of

And though, because I am what I am and in view of the multitude of benefits with which you have enriched me I might perhaps have had the courage to beg myself that my homeland should obtain if not Roman citizenship at least freedom and remission of tribute, I have felt it would be overbold to ask for anything of the kind and only prefer the very modest request of a favour which you will lose nothing by giving and my country will best profit by receiving.

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="288"><p>

It  was in Jerusalem, my emperor, that your much-

Having said thus much as a  claimant for justice and as a suppliant also on behalf of my native place I come finally to my supplication
for the temple. This temple, my Lord Gaius, has never from the first admitted any figure wrought by

men’s hands, because it is the sanctuary of the true God. For the works of painters and modellers are representations of gods perceived by sense but to paint or mould a likeness of the invisible was held by our ancestors to be against their religion.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="291"><p> Your

non-Greek, no satrap, no king, no mortal enemy, no faction, no war, no storming or sacking of the city, nor any existing thing ever brought about so great a violation of the temple as the setting up in it of an image or statue or any hand-wrought object for worship.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="293"><p> For even if they were ill-disposed and

hostile to the inhabitants of the land yet an instinct of reverence or fear warned them against breaking down any of the customs observed from the first in honour of the Maker and Father of all, for they knew that it was from these and like actions that the irreparable calamities of divine visitations spring. Therefore they took good care not to sow the seed of impiety, lest they should be compelled to reap its fruits which bring utter destruction.

your greatgrandfather the best of the emperors that ever were to this day, he who first received the title of Augustus for his virtue and good fortune, who disseminated peace everywhere over sea and land to the ends of the world?</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="310"><p> Did he not, hearing

by report the story of the temple and that it had no work of man’s hands, a visible effigy of an invisible being, erected in it, marvel and pay it honour?

<pb n="157"/>
For he had not taken a mere sip of philosophy but had feasted on it liberally and continued so to feast almost every day, partly by the memories of the lessons which his mind had conned from its earlier instruction in philosophy, partly by intercourse with the learned who from time to time were in his company. For in the gatherings at his table most of the time was assigned to listening to men of culture

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="311"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="40"/> While I have

a great abundance of evidence to show the wishes of your great-grandfather Augustus I will content myself with two examples. The first is a letter which he sent to the governors of the provinces in Asia, as he had learnt that the sacred first-fruits were treated with disrespect. He ordered that the Jews alone should be permitted by them to assemble in synagogues.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="312"><p> These gatherings, he said, were not

based on drunkenness and carousing to promote conspiracy and so to do grave injury to the cause of peace, but were schools of temperance and justice where men while practising virtue subscribed the annual first-fruits to pay for the sacrifices which they offer and commissioned sacred envoys to take them to the temple in Jerusalem.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="313"><p> Then he commanded that no

one should hinder the Jews from meeting or subscribing or sending envoys to Jerusalem according to their ancestral practice. For these were certainly the substance if not the actual words of his instructions.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="314"><p> But

there is one letter which I subjoin here to convince you, my lord and master, sent by Gaius Norbanus Flaccus


<pb n="159"/>

declaring what Caesar had written to him. Here is a transcript of this letter.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="315"><p> ‘Gaius Norbanus Flaccus proconsul

to the magistrates of the Ephesians, greeting. Caesar has written to me that the Jews, wherever they may be, regularly according to their old peculiar custom, make a rule of meeting together and subscribing money which they send to Jerusalem. He does not wish them to be hindered from doing this.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="316"><p> I therefore write to you to let you know that this is what he orders to be done.’ Is not this a clear proof, my

emperor, of the principles which he followed as to the honour due to our temple? He did not think that the form generally adopted about meetings should be applied to do away with the assemblages of the Jews to which they resort for collection of the first-fruits and their other religious observances.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="317"><p> Another

example no less cogent than this shows very clearly the will of Augustus. He gave orders for a continuation of whole burnt offerings every day to the Most High God to be charged to his own purse. These are carried out to this day. Two lambs and a bull are the victims with which he added lustre to the altar, knowing well that there is no image there openly or secretly set up.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="318"><p> Indeed this great ruler, this philosopher

second to none, reasoned in his mind that within the precincts of earth there must needs be a special place assigned as sacred to the invisible God which would contain no visible image, a place to give us participation in good hopes and enjoyment of perfect blessings.</p></div>

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="330"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="42"/> Having written and sealed this letter he

sent it to Gaius and shut himself up in his house where he remained greatly agitated and distraught, particularly by anxiety about the turn events might take. For the danger which had fallen upon him was no trifle but one which involved the expulsion, enslavement, and wholesale spoliation of the Jews who dwelt not only in the Holy Land but everywhere through the habitable world.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="331"><p> Gaius received the

letter and, as he read it, its every sentiment filled him with resentment at the ill-success of his project, yet at the same time he began to bend under the claims for justice coupled with supplication. And from one point of view he praised Agrippa and blamed him from another.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="332"><p> He charged him with over-complaisance



<pb n="167"/>

to his compatriots, who stood alone among mankind in their recalcitrance and refusal to accept his deification. He praised him for disguising and concealing nothing of his real self and this he said proved that he had the characteristics of the truly free and noble.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="333"><p> Thus to all appearance mollified he

thought good to give kindly answers to Agrippa’s request, granting him the chief and principal thing, that the installation should not now take place, and he ordered letters to be sent to Publius Petronius, governor of Syria, that he should forbear to take further steps to violate the tradition of the temple of the Jews.
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="334"><p><milestone unit="para"/>Nevertheless the concession thus granted by him

was not unmixed but had blended with it a very grave cause for alarm. For he added an injunction that if any persons in neighbouring regions outside the capital who wished to set up altars or temples or any images and statues in honour of him or his were prevented from so doing, Petronius was to punish the obstructors at once or send them up to him.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="335"><p> Now this was nothing else than a starting point

for seditions and civil conflicts and an indirect cancelling of what appeared to be a straightforward gift on his part. For it was to be expected that one party, through hostility to the Jews rather than reverence for Gaius, would fill the whole country with such installations, and the others seeing with their own eyes their ancestral institutions overthrown would not hold their hands even if they were the mildest of men. Then Gaius while awarding the severest punishment to those who had been provoked to violence would again order the statue to be set up in the temple.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="336"><p> But by a dispensation



<pb n="169"/>

of the providence and watchful care of God, who surveys and presides over all things with justice, not a single person among the neighbours gave any provocation to violence, so that no occasion arose which would entail a calamity passing beyond a moderate censure and against which no prayers would avail. But what was the use of this?</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="337"><p> one might

say, for if they remained quiet, Gaius did not. He was already repenting of his concession and resuscitating his recent desire. He ordered another bronze statue of colossal size coated with gold to be constructed in Rome. The one in Sidon he forbore from moving, for he did not wish to perturb the multitude by moving it, but intended when they were tranquil and freed from suspicion to have the other conveyed very quietly and secretly on shipboard and suddenly erected unobserved by the mass of the population.

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="338"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="43"/> This he intended to

do while coasting along on his voyage to Egypt. For he was possessed by an extraordinary and passionate love for Alexandria. His heart was entirely set upon visiting it and on his arrival staying there for a very considerable time. For he thought this city was unique in that it had both given birth to and would foster the idea of godship which occupied his dreams, and that its vast size and the world-wide value of its admirable situation

<note n="10.171.a">Here the description of Gaius’s conduct, interrupted by the parenthetical section on Alexandria, is resumed. The arrangement by which a new chapter is begun at § 338 is unfortunate.</note>
 In fact in all other matters he was

naturally untrustworthy, so that if he did commit any kind action he immediately repented of it and sought some means of cancelling it, thus causing increased affliction and injury.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="340"><p> Here is an instance of this

sort of thing. He released some prisoners for no reason, and then by imprisoning them again imposed on them a suffering heavier than the former through the bitter disappointment.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="341"><p> Again he sentenced

others to banishment when they expected death, not because their conscience told them that their action deserved death or even any minor penalty at all, but because in view of the supreme cruelty of their judge they did not expect to get off unpunished. To these banishment was a godsend as good as repatriation, since they felt that they had escaped from the extremity of danger which threatened their lives.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="342"><p> But no long time had elapsed when, though no fresh

occasion had been given, he sent some of his soldiers on duty to deal with them, and when these men of high excellence and nobility were leading their lives on the islands as though they were their native homes and bearing their misfortunes with the spirit of the favourites of fortune, he proceeded to slaughter them in a body, a blow which brought misery as heartrending as it was unexpected into the households of the great in Rome.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="343"><p> So too if he gave a present of money

to some he did not treat it as a loan and exact interest and compound interest, but as stolen property entailing very heavy loss for those who took it. For it was not enough for the poor wretches to repay the sums given to them, but they had to contribute as well their whole properties which they inherited from their parents or their relations and friends or

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="344"><p> Dignitaries who considered themselves

particularly distinguished suffered in another way which served his pleasure under the guise of friendship.

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="345"><p> And so some came to the point

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="346"><p> This great

inconstancy of conduct affected all, but particularly the Jewish race. Having conceived a violent enmity to them he took possession of the synagogues in the other cities after beginning with those of Alexandria, by filling them with images and statues of himself in bodily form. For by permitting others to instal them he virtually did it himself. The temple in the Holy City, which alone was left untouched being judged to have all rights of sanctuary, he was proceeding to convert and transmogrify into a temple of his own to bear the name of Gaius, “the new Zeus made manifest.”</p></div>

after giving some of his orders about the buildings he put to us this grave and momentous question, “Why do you refuse to eat pork?” The question was greeted by another outburst of laughter from some of our opponents because they were delighted, while with others it was a studied attempt to flatter him, intended to make the remark seem witty and sprightly.

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="366"><p> So with the statement of our case thus mangled and

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="367"><p> And God taking compassion on

<note n="10.185.b">Balsdon, who translates (p. 161) “for he heard our case though he paid no attention to some of the facts,” whence he infers that Philo is compelled to admit that Gaius gave a hearing to the Jewish arguments, is, I think, certainly wrong. The question mark appended both by Mangey and Reiter is necessitated by ὅς, which cannot bear the sense which Balsdon gives it.</note>
  Surely it was a cruel situation that the fate of all the Jews everywhere should rest precariously on us five envoys.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="371"><p> For if he should

decide in favour of our enemies, what other city will keep tranquil or refrain from attacking its fellow inhabitants, what house of prayer will be left unscathed, what kind of civic rights will not be upset for those whose lot is cast under the ancient institutions of the Jews? First upset, then shipwrecked, then sunk to the very bottom will be both their peculiar laws and the rights which they enjoy in common in every city.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="372"><p> Waterlogged by such considerations

we were dragged down and submerged in the depths, for those who hitherto seemed to be acting with us gave up. At least when we were summoned

the longing which he cherished for being acknowledged as a god.

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="373"><p><milestone unit="para"/>So now I have told in a summary way the cause

of the enmity which Gaius had for the whole nation of the Jews, but I must also describe the palinode.
<note n="10.187.a">“Counter-story” or “reversal.” Presumably this gave an account of Gaius’s death and probably also the change of policy adopted by Claudius, as shown in the two edicts recorded by Josephus, <hi rend="italic">Ant.</hi> xix. 5. If, that is, it was ever written, for it is curious that Eusebius in his brief notice of the <hi rend="italic">Legatio,</hi> see Introd. pp. xvii, shows no knowledge of it. But the word is an odd one, for though Philo uses παλινῳδεῖν=“repeat” in <hi rend="italic">De Mut.</hi> 53, the noun itself is only cited in the sense of recantation. <hi rend="italic">Cf.</hi> in Philo himself <hi rend="italic">De Post.</hi> 179, <hi rend="italic">De Som.</hi> ii. 232. The only sense in which the story of these events would be a recantation would be that it would force the doubters of providence to recant. I think παλινοδία, said by Suidas to=ἐναντία ὁδός, would be a more natural word.</note>
