<head>I. GLYCERA AND THAIS</head>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="1">
<p><label>GLYCERA</label> Tell me, Thais, do you
remember the Acarnanian soldier
who used to keep Abrotonum, and


<pb n="5"/>

who was afterward my lover-the
man in the gorgeous chlamys,-or
have you forgotten him?</p>

<p><label>THAIS</label> No, Glycera; I remember
him well. He drank with us last
year at the Cerealia. But why do
you ask? You seem to have some-
thing to say to me about him.</p>

<p><label>GLYCERA</label> That hussy, Gorgona,
has stolen him, whisked him away
from me; and I thought she was my
friend!</p>

<p><label>THAIS</label> Ah! is he no longer with
you? So he has taken up with Gor-
gona, has he?</p>

<p><label>GLYCERA</label> Alas! yes, Thais; and
it makes me very unhappy.</p>

<p><label>THAIS</label> That is a wretched trick,
Glycera; but you should have


<pb n="7"/>

expected it. Such things are done
among us courtesans. So don't be
downcast, and don't blame Gorgona.
Abrotonum bore you no grudge for
the same trick, and you were good
friends too. What surprises me is
that the soldier can find anything
beautiful in Gorgona. Unless he is
blind, he can't help seeing that she
is almost bald, with only a few stray
hairs about her forehead; that her
lips are withered, her mouth like a
mummy's, her neck all skin and
bone, her veins swollen, and her
nose long and pointed. I can see
nothing fine about her but her
figure, which is not so very bad,
and her smile, which is very win-
ning.


</p>

<pb n="9"/>

<p><label>GLYCERA</label> Do you suppose, pray,
that it's her beauty the Acarnanian
is in love with? Don't you know that
her mother is Chrysarium the witch,
skilled in the charms of the Thes-
salians, and able to bring the moon
down to the earth? Why, they say
she flies about at night. It is she
who has made the man love-mad by
giving him some philter to drink;
and now they are reaping a harvest
from him.</p>

<p><label>THAIS</label> Oh! well, Glycera; do you
reap a harvest from some one else,
and let him go to the devil!

<head>II. MYRTIUM, PAMPHILUS, AND DORIS</head>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="1">
<p>


<label>MYRTIUM</label> So you are going to
marry Phido the fisherman's daugh-
ter, are you, Pamphilus; indeed,
some say you have done so already.
And so all your oaths and tears are


<pb n="13"/>

gone in an instant, and you have
forgotten your Myrtium; and that
too, Pamphilus, when I am eight
months gone with child! All that
your love has been worth to me is a
shapeless figure, and soon I shall
have a child to nurse-a pretty task
for a courtesan! Don't imagine that
I will abandon it, especially if it's a
boy. I will bring him up, and call
him Pamphilus; he will console me
for my wasted love. Some day, he
will reproach you to your face
for deserting his unhappy mother.
However, your future spouse is no
beauty. I saw her not long ago at
the Thesmophoria, but little did I
suspect then that she would be
the cause of my seeing no more of


<pb n="15"/>

Pamphilus. Do at least, I beg you,
look her over carefully before you
marry her, so that you will not some
day have to regret taking a wife
with green eyes which look at each
other. However, you must have
seen Phido, the father of your lovely
inamorata; that is enough, without
looking at the daughter.</p>

<p><label>PAMPHILUS</label> How long, O Myr-
tium, do you propose to deafen me
with your nonsense about a fine
marriage and fishermen's daugh-
ters? As if I knew whether the girl
is pretty or snub-nosed! or whether
Phido of Alopece-for I suppose you
mean him-has a daughter old
enough to be married! Besides, he
isn't on friendly terms with my


<pb n="17"/>

father; they have had a lawsuit
lately about something or other. He
owed my father a talent, I believe,
and wouldn't pay him; so my father
haled him before the marine court.
It came terribly hard to Phido to
part with his money, and, indeed,
he didn't pay the whole, so far
as I know. If my heart were in
such haste to marry, would I take
Phido's daughter, when I refused
Demeas's daughter, my cousin on
my mother's side, whose father com-
manded our army last year? Who
told you this? did you invent this
absurd cause of jealousy yourself,
Myrtium?</p>

<p><label>MYRTIUM</label> Then you are not
going to marry, Pamphilus?


</p>

<pb n="19"/>

<p><label>PAMPHILUS</label> You are either mad
or tipsy, Myrtium, and yet we did
not drink to excess yesterday.</p>

<p><label>MYRTIUM</label> It was Doris who
caused all this unhappiness. I sent
her yesterday to buy some woollen
for my lying-in, and at the same
time to offer prayers for me in the
temple of Lucina. When she came
back, she told me that she met
Lesbia-but do you tell him, Doris,
what she told you, unless you made
up the story yourself.</p>

<p><label>DORIS</label> May I die, mistress, if I
lied to you.
When I was near the
prytaneum, I met Lesbia, who said
to me with a laugh: "Oho! so
Pamphilus, your lover, is going to
marry Phido's daughter. If you


<pb n="21"/>

don't believe it," she added, “you
have only to stoop and look through
the cracks of the door; you can
see the garlands with which the
house is hung; you can hear the
musicians, the noisy preparations,
and the wedding songs."</p>

<p><label>PAMPHILUS</label> Well, did you stoop,
Doris ?</p>

<p><label>DORIS</label> Why, yes, and I saw
what she told me.</p>

<p><label>PAMPHILUS</label> Ah! now I under-
stand your mistake.
Lesbia didn't
tell you a downright
lie; what you
told Myrtium is true.
But you were
wrong to be alarmed; I'm not the
one who's to be married. I remem-
ber that my mother said to me last
night when I went home from you:


<pb n="23"/>


"Pamphilus, you know Charmides,
the son of our neighbor Aristaenetus;
he is about your age, and here he is
going to marry and reform. When
do you propose to cease to live with
a harlot ?"-I paid no heed, and went
to bed. This morning I came here
at daybreak, so that is why I saw
nothing of the preparation of which
Doris speaks. If you still doubt,
go back, Doris, look carefully, not
inside the house, but at the door
itself; you will see that it is our
neighbor's door which is hung with
flowers.</p>

<p><label>MYRTIUM</label> Ah! Pamphilus, you
restore my life. I should have
hanged myself if you had played
me that trick.


</p>

<pb n="25"/>

<p><label>PAMPHILUS</label> But I never dreamed
of such a thing. Could I be so mad
as to forget my dear Myrtium, espe-
cially when she bears in her womb
the fruit of our love?

<head>III. PHILINNA AND HER MOTHER</head>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="1">
<p>



<label>THE MOTHER</label> Are you mad,
Philinna? What was the matter
with you yesterday at supper? This
morning, Diphilus came to me, with
tears in his eyes, and told me how
you had tormented him. You drank


<pb n="29"/>

too much; you got up and danced, in
spite of his remonstrances, and you
kissed his friend Lamprias. Then
you left Diphilus, who was in a
frenzy, and went and sat beside
Lamprias and put your arms around
his neck. Last night, you refused
to sleep with him; despite his tears,
you preferred to lie in bed all alone,
and began to sing just to tease him.</p>

<p><label>PHILINNA</label> He cannot have told
you, mother, what he did himself;
if he had, you would not stand up
for him, when it is he who has in-
sulted me. He went and flirted with
Thais, Lamprias's friend, before
Lamprias arrived. He saw plainly
enough from my actions that that
behavior annoyed me; whereupon,


<pb n="31"/>


he took Thais by the ear, threw her
head back, and kissed her as if he
would suck her lips away. I wept;
but he began to laugh, and whispered
a thousand things about me to Thais,
which made her laugh. Lamprias
arrived at last, when they had had
their fill of kisses. I went, all the
same, and sat on Diphilus's couch
at the table, so that he might have
no excuse for blaming me. Thais
was the first to rise and dance,
ostentatiously showing her leg as if
nobody else had a fine one. When
she had finished, Lamprias said not
a word; but Diphilus began to extol
Thais, her grace, her lightness of
foot, her movements and her steps,
always in rhythm with the cithara,


<pb n="33"/>

and her lovely leg, and so forth and
so on, as if he were singing the
praises of Sosandra of Calamis, in-
stead of Thais, whom you have seen
at the bath, mother, and you know
what a figure she has! But she
herself began to flout me. "If,"
she said, "a certain person isn't
afraid to show her scrawny legs,
why doesn't she get up and dance?"
I at once stood up and danced. What
else could I do? Should I have put
up with her insults, and have acted
as if they were deserved? Should I
have acknowledged her the queen of
the banquet?</p>

<p><label>THE MOTHER</label> You are too
proud, my child; you should not
notice such trifles. What next?


</p>

<pb n="35"/>

<p><label>PHILINNA</label> Every one present
overwhelmed me with applause;
Diphilus alone lay flat on his back,
counting the beams in the ceiling,
while I danced; and he didn't change
his position until fatigue compelled
me to stop.</p>

<p><label>THE MOTHER</label> But did you kiss
Lamprias? did you leave your seat
to go and embrace him? You do not
answer. That was inexcusable.</p>

<p><label>PHILINNA</label> I wanted to pay him
in his own coin.</p>

<p><label>THE MOTHER</label> Was that a rea-
son for refusing to lie with him?
You sang all night, while he wept.
Don't you know how poor we are,
child? Have you forgotten what
we have had from him? What a


<pb n="37"/>

winter we should have passed, had
not Venus sent us this good cus-
tomer!</p>

<p><label>PHILINNA</label> Must I endure his in-
sults, pray?</p>

<p><label>THE MOTHER</label> Lose your temper,
but don't treat him with contempt.
Don't you know that love, if one
spurns it, soon fades away and kills
itself? You do wrong to be harsh to
your lover. You know the proverb:
"Beware and not break the cord by
pulling too hard upon it."

<head>IV. MELISSA AND BACCHIS</head>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="1">
<p>
<label>MELISSA</label> If you happen to know,
Bacchis, any old woman who, like
the hags of Thessaly, possesses the
art of making people lovable by her
enchantments, even though she hap-
pen to be a thoroughly detestable


<pb n="41"/>

person, you would do me a very great
favor by bringing her to me. I would
gladly give her all my dresses and
my jewels, if her art would bring
Charinus back to me, and make him
abhor Simicha instead of me.</p>

<p><label>BACCHIS</label> What! Charinus is
no longer with you, Melissa? He
is keeping Simicha? So it was for
love of her that he defied the wrath
of his parents, and refused to marry
a rich heiress with a dowry of
five talents? For that is what you
told me.</p>

<p><label>MELISSA</label> Yes, Bacchis, all is lost
for me. For five whole days I have
not seen him. He is carousing now
with Simicha, at the house of his
boon-companion Pammenes.


</p>

<pb n="43"/>

<p><label>BACCHIS</label> I am sorry for you,
Melissa. But what can have made
this trouble between you? He must
have had some reason for throwing
you over.</p>

<p><label>MELISSA</label> I have no idea. Yes-
terday, on returning from Piraeus,
whither his father had sent him, I
believe, to collect some money that
was owing them, he came into the
house without even looking at me;
and when I ran forward to embrace
him as usual, "Leave me," he said,
pushing me away; "go to your
sailor Hermotimus, go and read
your name and his carved on the
walls of the Ceramicus, on a pil-
lar where every one can see them."
"What Hermotimus?" I asked;


<pb n="45"/>

"what pillar?"-But he made no
reply, refused to eat and drink, and
went to bed with his face to the wall.
What means did I not try to pacify
him! What an outlay of unavailing
caresses! I put my arms about him
gently, I kissed his back, the in-
grate! cold as marble, hard as
stone." Leave me," he said; "if
you continue to annoy me, I will go
elsewhere to sleep, although it is
past midnight."</p>

<p><label>BACCHIS</label> Do you know this
Hermotimus?</p>

<p><label>MELISSA</label> May I be more woe-
begone than I am now, if I know
the man! However, Charinus woke
at cock-crow and went away at
daybreak. As I was determined to



<pb n="47"/>

find out whether, as he had alleged,
my name was carved on the walls
of the Ceramicus, I sent Acis there
to see. She found only these words,
written at the right of the gate:
Melissa loves Hermotimus, and, be-
low: The sailor Hermotimus loves
Melissa.</p>

<p><label>BACCHIS</label> A wretched jest of
some mischievous youth! I see
what it means. Some one put that
inscription there to tease Charinus,
knowing that he is jealous, and he
swallowed it at once. I will speak
to him the first time I see him. He's
an inexperienced youth.</p>

<p><label>MELISSA</label> Where can you see
him? He is shut up with Simicha
all day. His parents have sent here


<pb n="49"/>

to inquire for him, to no purpose.
O Bacchis, if I could find the old
woman I have described to you, it
would save my life.</p>

<p><label>BACCHIS</label> There is an old girl, a
Syrian by birth, and a very clever
magician, who once reconciled me
with Phanias when he broke with
me for a mere nothing, like your
Charinus. She brought my faithless
lover back to me by her enchant-
ments, after he had been away four
months, and just as I was beginning
to lose hope.</p>

<p><label>MELISSA</label> How much does she
want, do you remember?</p>

<p><label>BACCHIS</label> She doesn't require
very much. I got out of it for a
loaf and a drachma.
You must also


<pb n="51"/>

take her some salt, seven obols, sul-
phur, and a torch. The old woman
takes them, then pours wine into a
jar, and drinks it all by herself. She
must also have something that be-
longed to the man, a coat, a shoe,
or a lock of hair.</p>

<p><label>MELISSA</label> Good! I have his san-
dals.</p>

<p><label>BACCHIS</label> She will hang them
on a peg, burn sulphur underneath,
sprinkle salt on the chafing-dish,
muttering your name and your
lover's; then, taking a wheel from
her bosom, she will whirl it about
and rapidly mumble her spell, made
up of a lot of outlandish words that
I make you shudder. That is what
she did in my case.
Soon after,


<pb n="53"/>

ત્યાર
Phanias, despite his companions, and
despite the entreaties of Phobis,
with whom he was living, yielded
to the power of the spell and came
back to me. In addition, the old
woman taught me the secret of
making him hate Phobis bitterly; it
consisted in following her footprints
and rubbing them out by putting
my right foot where she had put her
left, and my left where she had put
her right, saying: "I am walking on
you, I am on your heels." I did just
as she told me.</p>

<p><label>MELISSA</label> Hasten, hasten, O Bac-
chis, and bring this Syrian to me.
And do you, Acis, prepare sulphur,
a loaf, and all that she needs to cast
her spell.

that you lie in bed, doing I don't

know what. Ah! you blush? Tell
me if it is true?</p>

<p><label>LEANA</label> There is some truth in
it, and I am ashamed of it. It is
shocking.</p>

<p><label>CLONARIUM</label> - By Ceres, what
does it mean? What does the
woman want of you? What do you
do when you are together? If you
love me, you will tell me.</p>

<p><label>LEAENA</label> I love you more than
any one; but that woman is strangely
like a man.</p>

<p><label>CLONARIUM</label> If I understand
you, she is one of those women, of
whom there are so many in Lesbos,
who do not like men, but enjoy the
society of women, as if they were
men themselves.


</p>

<pb n="59"/>

<p><label>LEANA</label> That's about it.</p>

<p><label>CLONARIUM</label> Tell me all, Le-
aena; how she approached you,
how she seduced you, and all the
rest.</p>

<p><label>LEAENA</label> As she and Demonassa
of Corinth, who has the same tastes,
were on a carouse together, they
sent for me to entertain them with
my cithara. When I finished sing-
ing, it was late, and time to retire to
bed; they were warm with wine, and
detained me.-"Come, Leana," said
Megilla; "it is time to sleep; you
shall lie between us."</p>

<p><label>CLONARIUM</label> And then? went
you to bed with them?</p>

<p><label>LEAENA</label> At first, they kissed me
like men; not simply putting their


<pb n="61"/>

lips to mine, but kissing me open-
mouthed. Then they embraced me
and pressed my bosom; Demonassa
became so excited that she even bit
me, between her kisses. I did not
know what they purposed doing. At
last, Megilla, waxing warmer, took
off her wig, which was wonderfully
well made and fitted her snugly,
and appeared with her head bare and
shaven like an athlete's, which
alarmed me.-"
"Leaena," she said,
"did you ever see such a fine young
man?"-"I see none, Megilla," I re-
plied. "Don't insult me by calling
me that; I am Megillus, and there is
my wife"-pointing to Demonassa.
At that, Clonarium, I began to laugh.
-"What, O Megillus," I said, "you


<pb n="63"/>

were a man all the time, without
knowing it, like Achilles hidden
among the maidens in his purple
vestments? In that case, do you play
the husband with Demonassa ?”-
"No," she said; "for I do not need
to. If you choose, you shall see
that my ways are much better."-
'Then," said I, "you must be a
hermaphrodite, partaking of a dual
nature;"-for, Clonarium, I did not,
up to that time, comprehend the
matter. "No," she replied; "I
am entirely a man."-"I have
heard that the famous soothsayer
of Thebes, Tiresias, I think, whose
story Ismenodora, the Boeotian flute-
player, once told me, was changed
from a woman to a man. Has


<pb n="65"/>



anything of that sort happened to
you?" "No," she said; "I am like
other women, Leana; but I have
all the passions and desires of a
man."-"Do you mean that the
desire is enough for you?"-" Let
me show you, Leaena, if you don't
credit it, and you will see that I am
not inferior to a man; that I possess
equal attractions to his. But try,
and be convinced."—I yielded, Clo-
narium, to her urgent entreaties; for
she had given me a beautiful neck-
lace and a linen gown of the finest
fabric. She embraced me, just as
if she had been a man, and kissed
me, and the fulfilment of her desire
made her pant; I saw that she vastly
enjoyed herself.


</p>

<pb n="67"/>

<p><label>CLONARIUM</label> But what did she
do? How did she go about it? That
is what you must tell me.</p>

<p><label>LEAENA</label> No, you are too inquisi-
tive; that is quite enough. No, by
Venus, I will tell you nothing more.

<p>



<label>CROBYLE</label> Well, Corinna, you
see now that it is not such a terrible
thing to cease to be a virgin, and to
live with a handsome youth who
gives you a mina at the outset, with


<pb n="71"/>

which I propose to buy you a neck-
lace.</p>

<p><label>CORINNA</label> Yes, mamma; and get
one with beautiful flame-colored
stones, like Philaenis's.</p>

<p><label>CROBYLE</label> It shall be just like
hers. But that isn't all; listen, my
child, while I tell you what you have
to do, and how you must act with
the men. You know that we have
nothing else to live on. For two
years past, since your father went
to a better world, you have seen
how hard it has been for us to live.
While he was alive, we wanted
nothing; he was the best smith in
Piraeus; everybody agrees that such
another smith as Philinus will never
be seen.</p>
<p>After his death, I was


<pb n="73"/>

obliged to sell his tongs, hammers,
and anvil, the whole for two minae,
on which we lived for a little while.
Then, by weaving and spinning I
was barely able to earn our bread.
I have supported you until now, my
girl, with but one hope.</p>

<p><label>CORINNA</label> You mean the mina I
have earned?</p>

<p><label>CROBYLE</label> - No;
but I have
thought that you are old enough
now to support me in your turn, to
obtain fine dresses for yourself,
splendid jewels, and servants.</p>

<p><label>CORINNA</label> How so, mother? what
do you mean?</p>

<p><label>CROBYLE</label> By leading a merry
life with the young men, and lying
with them, for money.


</p>

<pb n="75"/>

<p><label>CORINNA</label> Like Lyra, Daphnis's
daughter?</p>

<p><label>CROBYLE</label> Yes.</p>

<p><label>CORINNA</label> But she's a strumpet!</p>

<p><label>CROBYLE</label> What harm is there
in that? You will be as rich as she,
with many lovers. Why are you
crying, Corinna? Don't you see
how many such women there are,
how they are run after, how much
money they earn! I knew Daphnis
before her daughter grew up, O
blessed Adrastia! and how ragged
she was! Just see how she dresses
now! Gold, embroidered dresses,
four servants!</p>

<p><label>CORINNA</label> How did she get it
all?

<p><label>CROBYLE</label> In the first place, by
her refined dress, by her graceful
bearing, by being affable to every-
body. She doesn't laugh every
minute as you do, but smiles in
a gracious, captivating way; she
treats all the men courteously, and
neither deceives those who come
to see her or who send for her,
nor herself lays hold of them. If
she is invited to a banquet with
some gift, instead of getting tipsy,
which makes a woman ridiculous,
and which men detest; instead of
eating greedily like an ill-bred miss,
she lifts her food daintily with the
tips of her fingers, eats each mouth-
ful noiselessly and without filling
her mouth, and drinks quietly, not


<pb n="79"/>

emptying her glass at a single gulp,
but sipping it slowly.</p>

<p><label>CORINNA</label> But when she's very thirsty?</p>

<p><label>CROBYLE</label> All the more when
she's thirsty, my child. She talks
no more than is becoming, doesn't
laugh at the guests, has no eyes
except for the man who has paid
for her. So that everybody likes
her. When it is time to go to bed,
she shows neither too great haste,
nor indifference; she thinks only
of pleasing her lover and making
herself attractive to him. That is
what the men particularly like in
her. If you copy her ways, we shall
be as fortunate as she; for you
are better looking. But, O blessed


<pb n="81"/>

Adrastia! I say only this: may you
live alone!</p>

<p><label>CORINNA</label> Tell me, mother, are
all lovers like Eucritus, who was
with me yesterday?</p>

<p><label>CROBYLE</label> There are some hand-
somer; others are more stoutly
built; there are some, too, who are
less handsome.</p>

<p><label>CORINNA</label> And must I lie with all
such?</p>

<p><label>CROBYLE</label> Why, yes, my child.
They are the ones who pay best;
the handsome ones pay with their
good looks only. Think before all
else of procuring open-handed lovers,
if you want to hear people say in a
little while: "Look at Corinna, Cro-
byle's daughter; how rich she is,


<pb n="83"/>

and how lucky her mother is!"-
What do you say? Will you do
what I tell you?
Yes, you will do it,
I am sure; and
you will soon out-
shine them all. Now, go and take
your bath. Eucritus may come again
to-day; he promised me that he
would.

<head>VII. MUSARIUM AND HER MOTHER</head>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="1">
<p>


<label>THE MOTHER</label> If we happen upon
another lover like Chaereas, O Mu-
sarium, we must sacrifice a white
goat to Venus Pandemos, a heifer to
Venus Urania and to the goddess of
the gardens, and offer a crown to the


<pb n="87"/>

goddess of wealth; for we shall be
truly fortunate, oh! thrice fortunate.
See all that the young man has
given us! you have not had from
him as yet a single obol, nor a dress,
nor a pair of sandals, nor a jar of
perfume! Only promises and hopes,
with a long time to run! Every
day, it's the same old story: "If my
father-When I come into my prop-
erty, everything shall be yours."—
And you say he has sworn to marry
you?</p>

<p><label>MUSARIUM</label> Yes, mother; he has
sworn it by the two goddesses and
by the protectress of the city.</p>

<p><label>THE MOTHER</label> And you, like a
fool, believe him? Perhaps that is
why, as he had nothing to pay his


<pb n="89"/>

scot with, you gave him your ring
the other day, without telling me;
he went and sold it, and spent the
money for drink. And you gave
him the two Ionian necklaces too,
each of them weighing two darics,
which Praxias of Chios, the sea-captain, brought you from Ephesus,
where he had them made for you.
Of course, Chaereas must have the
wherewithal to pay his scot, in his
carousings with his friends. I say
nothing of your tunics which you
gave him. On my word, the fellow
is a perfect treasure, sent to us by
Mercury!</p>

<p><label>MUSARIUM</label> But he is handsome,
mother; he has no beard. He tells
me he adores me, and his tears are
re


<pb n="91"/>

so affecting! Besides, he is the son
of Deinomache and Laches, the Are-
opagite, and he promises to marry
me; we have everything to hope
from him, as soon as his old father
dies.</p>

<p><label>THE MOTHER</label> And so, when we
need shoes, and the shoemaker wants
two drachmae for them, we'll say to
him: "There's no money, but what
do you say to a few hopes?" and
we must say the same to the baker.
When we are asked for our rent, it
will be: "Wait till Laches of Colyt-
tus is dead; we'll pay you after the
wedding."-Aren't you ashamed to
be the only one among your compan-
ions without ear-rings or necklaces,
or Tarentine dresses?


</p>

<pb n="93"/>

<p><label>MUSARIUM</label> But are they any
happier or prettier than I am, mother?</p>

<p><label>THE MOTHER</label> No, but they are
more cunning; they know their trade,
and don't trust fine words and young
popinjays who always have promises
on their lips. You pride yourself on
your fidelity, you love Chaereas as
if he were your husband, and you
don't receive anybody else. Why,
only the other day, when that farmer
from Acarnania came and offered
you two minae, the price of the wine
which his father had sent him to
sell, you refused him with a con-
temptuous air. And yet he, too, is
young and beardless; but you had
promised the night to your Adonis
Chaereas.


</p>

<pb n="95"/>

<p><label>MUSARIUM</label> What! ought I to
have left Chaereas in the lurch,
to receive a clown who stinks like a
goat? Chaereas has a soft skin at
all events, while that pig of an
Acarnanian-
</p>

<p><label>THE</label> MOTHER.-I admit that he's
a clodhopper and doesn't smell sweet.
But why didn't you take up with
Antiphon the son of Menecrates,
who offered you a mina? He is
handsome, gallant, and about Chae-
reas's age.</p>

<p><label>MUSARIUM</label> Chaereas threatened
to kill us both if he found us to-
gether.</p>

<p><label>THE MOTHER</label> Many other men
have made the same threat. If you
mind such things, you'll have no


<pb n="97"/>

lovers. Instead of leading the life
of a courtesan, you will live chastely
like a priestess of Ceres. By the
way, to-day is her festival; what
has he given you for your pleasure?
</p>

<p><label>MUSARIUM</label> He has nothing,
mamma.</p>

<p><label>THE MOTHER</label> Then he's the
only young fellow who can't get
something out of his father. Can't
he send some rascally servant to
him, or apply to his mother for
money, threatening to set sail for the
army if she refuses? No; he prefers
to stay here in our house, ruin-
ing us, giving us nothing himself,
and preventing others from giving.
Do you suppose, pray, Musarium,
that you will always be eighteen


<pb n="99"/>

years old, that Chaereas will still be
as mad after you when he's rolling in
gold and his mother has found a rich
wife for him? As if the sight of a
dowry of five talents wouldn't make
him forget everything,-his oaths,
his tears, and your kisses!</p>

<p><label>MUSARIUM</label> He forgets nothing.
To prove it, I have his refusal to
marry thus far. In spite of per-
sistent urging and constraint, he
has never consented.</p>

<p><label>THE MOTHER</label> Heaven grant
that he doesn't deceive you! But
if he does, I will remind you of what
I have just said, O Musarium.

<p><label>CHRYSIS</label> Do you mean that
those are the only proofs of affec-
tion?</p>

<p><label>AMPELIS</label> Yes, there are no surer
signs of a heart truly in love. All the
rest-kisses, tears, oaths, frequent
visits-simply indicate a dawning
love which aspires to grow. But
real ardor manifests itself in jeal-
ousy. So that, if Gorgias has struck
you, as you say, if he is violently
jealous, be of good cheer, and pray
that he may always do the same.</p>

<p><label>CHRYSIS</label> Always the same!
What do you say? Pray that he
may always beat me?</p>

<p><label>AMPELIS</label> No, not just that. But
that he may always be angry when
you look at another man. If he


<pb n="105"/>

were not in love with you, it wouldn't
anger him to know that you had
another lover.</p>

<p><label>CHRYSIS</label> But I haven't. He has
no reason to suspect me of loving
that young Croesus whom I hap-
pened heedlessly to mention in his
presence the other day.</p>

<p><label>AMPELIS</label> It's a good thing for
you that he suspects you of being
sought after by the rich. Your
lover will be the more uneasy; he
will consider his honor involved,
and will be afraid of being outdone
by his rivals.</p>

<p><label>CHRYSIS</label> Yes, but meanwhile
he does nothing but fly into a rage
and beat me; that's all I get from
him.


</p>

<pb n="107"/>

<p><label>AMPELIS</label> He will give you some-
thing else later. Jealous lovers
become generous at last.</p>

<p><label>CHRYSIS</label> But I don't see, Ampe-
lis, why you want me to be beaten.</p>

<p><label>AMPELIS</label> I do not. I simply tell
you that they fall deeper in love
when they believe that they are
scorned. On the other hand, when
a lover believes that he alone is
loved, his ardor fades away. I am
speaking from twenty years' expe-
rience, and you are barely eighteen
yet. Shall I tell you what happened
to me some time ago? I had for my
lover Demophantus the usurer, who
lives behind the Pocile. He had
never given me more than five
drachmae, but he tried to domineer


<pb n="109"/>

over me. His love was only skin-
deep; he didn't sigh, or weep, or
stand guard over my door at night.
He just passed the night with me
now and again. One day he ap-
peared, and I shut the door in his
face. I had the painter Callides with
me, who had sent me ten drachmae.
At first, my old usurer went away,
after calling me all manner of names.
Two or three days later, as I had
not sent for him, and Callides was
still with me, he began to feel the
fire of love, and came to my house
in a ferment. The door was open;
he rushed in, wept, beat me, threat-
ened to kill me, to tear my dress off
my back, acted like a madman, and
ended by giving me a talent, which


<pb n="111"/>

assured my fidelity for eight months.
His wife told everybody I had be-
witched him; but jealousy did it all.
Try it with your Gorgias, Chrysis.
He will be a rich man when' his
father dies.

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="1">
<p><label>DORCAS</label> We are undone, mis-
tress, we are undone! Polemo has
come back from the army, so they
say, rolling in gold. I saw him go
by, wearing a purple cloak fastened
S
Se


<pb n="115"/>

by a gold clasp, and followed by
a crowd of servants. As soon as
his friends saw him, they hastened
to salute him; just then, I saw be-
hind him the fellow he had before
he went away. I went up to him,
and began: "Well, Parmeno, what
luck have you had? what fine
things have you brought back from
the war?"</p>

<p><label>PANNYCHIS</label> You shouldn't have
thrown that question at him so soon;
you should have said: "Thank the
gods, you are at home again, safe
and well; thanks to Zeus, the god of
hospitality, and to Athene, goddess
of war! My mistress speaks of you
every day, asking me where you are,
what you are doing."-And it would


<pb n="117"/>

have been even better if you had
added: "She does nothing but weep,
thinking of Polemo."</p>

<p><label>DORCAS</label> That is how I did be-
gin. I didn't want to say it all over
again to you; I was so impatient to
tell you what I found out. When
I first accosted Parmeno, I said to
him: "Your ears must often have
burned, for my mistress has done
nothing but talk about you, and has
wept from morning till night, espe-
cially when she heard of a battle in
which many were said to have been
killed; then she would tear her hair,
beat her breast, and burst into tears
at every report."</p>

<p><label>PANNYCHIS</label> Excellent, Dorcas;
that was the way to talk.


</p>

<pb n="119"/>

<p><label>DORCAS</label> Then I asked him what
I told you first.-"We have come
back rich," he said.</p>

<p><label>PANNYCHIS</label> What!
Didn't he
say first that Polemo hadn't forgotten
me, and hoped to find me still alive?</p>

<p><label>DORCAS</label> He did say something
like that; but the greater part of
his talk was of vast wealth, gold,
fine clothes, slaves, and ivory; as
for their silver, they don't pretend
to count it; they have bushels of it.
Parmeno himself had an enormous
ring on his finger, many-sided, with
a stone of three colors. He began
to tell me how they crossed the
Halys and defeated Tiridates, and
how gallantly Polemo fought against
the Pisidians; but I left him, and


<pb n="121"/>

hurried home to tell you the news,
so that you might decide what was
to be done. For if Polemo comes,-
and he is sure to come as soon as
he gets rid of his friends,-when he
sees what he has come back to, and
finds Philostratus here, what will
happen?</p>

<p><label>PANNYCHIS</label> Dorcas, we must
try to get out of the scrape. It
wouldn't be fair to turn Philostratus
out of doors, when he has just given
me a talent. Besides, he is a rich
tradesman, and has promised won-
ders. On the other hand, it wouldn't
be well to refuse to receive Polemo,
who has come back so prosperous.
And you know how jealous he is.
His temper was unendurable even


<pb n="123"/>

ཐ་བ་
when he had nothing; what will it
be now that he's rich?</p>

<p><label>DORCAS</label> Here he comes!</p>

<p><label>PANNYCHIS</label> O Dorcas, I shall
faint. What shall I do? I am trem-
bling with fright.</p>

<p><label>DORCAS</label> And here's Philostra-
tus, too!</p>

<p><label>PANNYCHIS</label> What will become
of me? Oh! if only the earth would
open!</p>

<p><label>PHILOSTRATUS</label> Well, Panny-
chis, when do we sup?</p>

<p><label>PANNYCHIS</label> Oh! you wretch,
you have ruined me.-Good-morn-
ing, Polemo! it's a long while since
we have seen you.</p>

<p><label>POLEMO</label> Who is this fellow?
You don't answer? This is the end,


<pb n="125"/>

Pannychis! To think that I have
made the journey hither from Pylae
in five days for such a woman!
Why, I almost flew. Thanks; you'll
get nothing from me henceforth.</p>

<p><label>PHILOSTRATUS</label> Who may you
be, my good man?</p>

<p><label>POLEMO</label> Do you happen to
know Polemo of Styria, of the tribe
of Pandion, formerly commander of
a thousand men, now of five thou-
sand, and Pannychis's lover before
she went mad?</p>

<p><label>PHILOSTRATUS</label> But Pannychis
is mine now, O captain. I have
given her a talent, and I will double
the amount as soon as I have sold
my wares. Come, Pannychis, and
let this fellow go to the Odrysians,


<pb n="127"/>

or wherever else he chooses, to fight
battles.
</p>

<p><label>DORCAS</label> (to Philostratus).—She
is free; I suppose she can go with
whom she likes.</p>

<p><label>PANNYCHIS</label> What shall I do,
Dorcas?</p>

<p><label>DORCAS</label> Go inside; that is the
better way. Polemo is in too great
a rage to run the risk of staying
with him. His jealousy might carry
him to any length.
</p>

<p><label>PANNYCHIS</label> (to Philostratus).—
Come in, if you choose.</p>

<p><label>POLEMO</label> 'Tis well. But I swear
that you drink together to-day for
the last time. We will see whether
I have forgotten how to draw blood.
Ho! Parmeno, my Thracians! Let


<pb n="129"/>

them come with their arms; draw
up the phalanx at the door: men-
at-arms in front, slingmen and bow-
men on each wing, the others in the
rear.</p>

<p><label>PHILOSTRATUS</label> -
-
Your threats
may serve to frighten children;
but do you expect to frighten
me, O captain of mercenaries?
You never killed so much as a
chicken. If you ever saw a battle,
I doubt not it was from the top of
a rampart. You may have com-
manded a squad; that's the most I
can allow.</p>

<p><label>POLEMO</label> You will find out pres-
ently, when you see us marching
upon you, encased in glittering
armor.


</p>

<pb n="131"/>

<p><label>PHILOSTRATUS</label> Come on. Tib-

you turn tail with stones and oyster-
shells, and you won't know where

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="1">
<p><label>CHELIDONIUM</label> Doesn't young
Clinias come to see you now, Drosis?
It's a long while since I saw him at
your house.


</p>

<pb n="135"/>

<p><label>DROSIS</label> Alas, no! his master
won't let him come.</p>

<p><label>CHELIDONIUM</label> -
What master?
do you mean Diotimus, the school-
master? He is a friend of mine.</p>

<p><label>DROSIS</label> No; I mean Aristane-
tus, the most hateful of philosophers.</p>

<p><label>CHELIDONIUM</label> What! you mean
that monkey-faced creature with the
long beard, who walks every day
in the Pocile, surrounded by young
men?</p>

<p><label>DROSIS</label> Yes, that estimable in-
dividual. I should delight to see the
hangman drag him to the gallows
by his beard.

</p>

<p><label>CHELIDONIUM</label> Whatever in-
duced him to give Clinias such
advice?


</p>

<pb n="137"/>

<p><label>DROSIS</label> I have no idea, Cheli-
donium. That young man has never,
since he knew what women were,
passed a single night out of my arms,
for I first initiated him in the mys-
teries of love; and now he hasn't
appeared for three days, hasn't even
passed my door. As I was worried
by his absence, as if by a presenti-
ment of what was coming, I decided
to send Nebris to the places he
frequents, to try to find him in the
market-place or in the Pocile. When
she returned, she said that she saw
him walking with Aristaenetus, and
made signs to him at a distance;
but Clinias blushed and looked down
when he saw her, and wouldn't turn
his face in her direction again. Then
re


<pb n="139"/>

they returned to the city, and Nebris
followed them to the Sacred Gate.
But, as Clinias didn't turn, she came
back with no certain news for me.
Imagine my state of mind from that
moment. I could not conceive what
he could have against me. I said
to myself: "Have I done anything to
hurt him? Is he in love with some
other woman? Does he hate me
now? Doubtless his father has for-
bidden him to come."-Such were my
thoughts when, last night, after sup-
per, Dromo came with a letter from
him. Here it is; read it to me, Cheli-
donium; for you can read, can't you?</p>

<p><label>CHELIDONIUM</label> Let me see it.
The handwriting is very bad, and the
words are written over one another,


<pb n="141"/>

which shows that he was in a hurry.
This is what he says: "The gods
are my witnesses, how I loved you,
O Drosis!"</p>

<p><label>DROSIS</label> Alas! woe's me! he
doesn't even begin with words of
greeting!
</p>

<p><label>CHELIDONIUM</label> (reading)." My
sentiments are still the same, but I am
compelled to part from you. My father
has put me in the hands of Aristane-
tus, to learn philosophy. Aristaenetus
knew of our intimacy, and reproached
me bitterly. 'It is a shame,' he said,
'for the son of Architeles and Erasi-
clea to live with a harlot; virtue
should be preferred to debauchery.""</p>

<p><label>DROSIS</label> A plague on the old fool
for giving such advice to a youth!



</p>

<pb n="143"/>

<p><label>CHELIDONIUM</label> (reading).—"I am
obliged to obey him, for he follows
me everywhere, watches me all the
time, and doesn't allow me to look at
anybody but him. He promises that,
if I am good and obey him in every-
thing, he will make me happy, and
lead me on to virtue through long
and trying labors. I have found it
difficult to write this secretly. Be
happy, and remember Clinias."</p>

<p><label>DROSIS</label> Well, what do you think
of that letter?</p>

<p><label>CHELIDONIUM</label> It is after the
Scythian style, very harsh; but
the last words, "remember Clinias,"
leave a little room for hope.</p>

<p><label>DROSIS</label> So it seemed to me. But
I am dying of love for him. Dromo told


<pb n="145"/>

me that Aristaenetus is a pederast, and
that, under the pretext of teaching
them philosophy, he debauches the
handsomest youths. He has already
talked privately with Clinias; he
makes the finest promises, and says
that he will make him equal to the
gods. He gives him the erotic dia-
logues between the philosophers of
old times and their disciples to read; in
fact, he never lets him alone. Dromo
threatens to tell Clinias's father.</p>

<p><label>CHELIDONIUM</label> Dromo deserves
a royal feast.</p>

<p><label>DROSIS</label> I have given it to him,
but there was no need of it; he's in
love with Nebris.</p>

<p><label>CHELIDONIUM</label> In that case, all
will go well. My advice is that we


<pb n="147"/>

write on the wall of the Ceramicus,
near where Architeles walks every
day: Aristaenetus defiles Clinias.
That would help amazingly to con-
firm what Dromo says.</p>

<p><label>DROSIS</label> But how can we do it
without being seen?</p>

<p><label>CHELIDONIUM</label> I will go at night,
and write it with a piece of charcoal.</p>

<p><label>DROSIS</label> Excellent! I pray you,
help me to contend against that
overbearing Aristaenetus.

that much at least by passing the

<p><label>CHARMIDES</label> I am dying with

other is called the Trap.</p>

<p><label>CHARMIDES</label> She is the one;

<p><label>TRYPHAENA</label> I can quite believe

disgusted by the blotches with which

And you mourn because you cannot
enjoy such beauty? Is she always
cruel to you, pray?</p>

<p><label>CHARMIDES</label> Even so, Tryphaena;
and yet I have loaded her with gifts.
To-day, as I was unable to give
her a thousand drachmae which she

money my father keeps me,-she
shut her door in my face and opened
it to Moschius; so I took you for
my mistress, to repay her in kind.</p>

been told that you sent for me to
spite somebody else, and that some-
body an old mummy like Phile-

go; the cock has already crowed
thrice.</p>

<p><label>CHARMIDES</label> Don't be in such a
hurry, Tryphaena. If what you tell
me about Philematium is true, if she
wears a wig, if she dyes the hair on
her temples, and has pimples, I never
want to see her again.

whether she has been to the bath

grandfather can tell you that, if
he's still alive.</p>

<p><label>IOESSA</label> You despise me, O Lys-

"Some one is here"; never urged
you to deceive your father or rob

your mother of jewels to bring to
me, as all other courtesans do. The
first day I ever saw you, I welcomed
you, never asking you for anything,
or making you pay for what you
consumed. You know how many
lovers I have refused for you: Etho-
cles, now one of the Prytanes, Pasion
the sea-captain, and Melissus, who
is as young as you, and whose father
has just died leaving a handsome
fortune. You alone have been my
Phaon, I have had eyes for none but
you, have opened my door to none
but you, for I was mad enough to
believe in the genuineness of your
oaths; I loved you so that I have
lived like the chaste Penelope, de-
spite my mother's lamentations and


<pb n="167"/>

her constant reproaches, and in the
sight of my companions, who called
my chastity a crime. You, on the
contrary, since you have seen that
you have conquered me, that I am
withering away with love, have
done nothing but torture me, either
by toying with Lycana before my
eyes, or by praising Magidium the
harp-player to the skies when you
were lying with me. I have an-
swered these insults, bitterly as I
have felt them, with tears alone.
Only the other day, when you and
Thraso and Diphilus were carousing
together, you sent for Cymbalium
the flute-player, and Pyrallis, with
whom I am not on good terms, as
you know. Although you kissed


<pb n="169"/>

Cymbalium five times, I said noth-
ing; you insulted no one but your-
self by kissing such a creature; but
your nods and winks at Pyrallis!
you did not drink once that you did
not raise the cup to her, and when
you handed it to your servant you
whispered to him to fill it only for
her! After taking a bite from an
apple, you seized the opportunity,
when Diphilus was talking to Thraso,
to toss it adroitly into her bosom,
without even trying to conceal your
actions from me. Pyrallis instantly
kissed it and replaced it in her
bosom. Why do you treat me
so? Have I failed you in any re-
spect? Have I offended you in the
least degree? Have I so much as


<pb n="171"/>

looked at another man? Do I not
live for you alone? Ah! Lysias,
how little store you set by my
affection! What does it matter to
you that you torture a poor creature
who is mad with love? But there
is a goddess who sees the wrongs of
lovers. Some day, perhaps, you will
weep for loessa, when you learn that
she has strangled herself, or jumped
into a well, that she has ceased to
live, in order not to annoy you by
her presence. You will be at liberty
to boast of such a glorious triumph.
But why do you scowl at me? Why
gnash your teeth? Have you any-
thing to reproach me for? Speak!
Pythias here will judge between us.
What! you are going away without


<pb n="173"/>

a word? Ah! Pythias, you see what
suffering the ungrateful man inflicts
upon me.</p>

<p><label>PYTHIAS</label> How cruel! He must
be made of stone, not to be moved
by your tears. It is in very truth
your fault, loessa; your excessive
love reveals your weakness to him.
You must not show your love so
plainly. Men become puffed up as
soon as they see that we love them.
Dry your tears, and close your door
to the ingrate; he will very soon dote
as madly on you, and be all flame.</p>

<p><label>IOESSA</label> Nay, do not give me
such counsel. I, close my door to
Lysias! May the gods grant that
he do not leave me first!</p>

<p><label>PYTHIAS</label> Here he comes again.


</p>

<pb n="175"/>

<p><label>IOESSA</label> O Pythias, I am undone!
He must have heard you tell me to
close my door to him.</p>

<p><label>LYSIAS</label> I have come back, Pyth-
ias, not for her sake, whom I never-
more want to see, but so that you
cannot say again that I am heart-
less.</p>

<p><label>PYTHIAS</label> I did say so, Lysias, I
admit.</p>

<p><label>LYSIAS</label> And you expect me to
put up with this loessa just because
she whimpers, when I know that she
is false to me? I surprised her not
long ago sleeping in a young man's
arms.</p>

<p><label>PYTHIAS</label> Well, what of it? isn't
she a courtesan? When did you
surprise them?


</p>

<pb n="177"/>

<p><label>LYSIAS</label> About six days ago;
yes, six days, for it was the second
of the month, and to-day is the
seventh. My father, being aware
of my craze for this paragon of
virtue, had locked me in and ordered
the porter not to let me out. But I,
in my impatience to see her, resorted
to stratagem: I bade Dromo stand
against the wall where it is quite
low, and to let me stand on his back
and climb over. I succeeded in doing
it; I reached her house; I found the
courtyard door tightly closed; it
was late; instead of knocking, I
softly opened the door, as I had done
so many times, turned it noiselessly
on its hinges, and entered. Every-
body was asleep; I felt my way


<pb n="179"/>

along the wall, and reached my faith-
less one's bed.</p>

<p><label>IOESSA</label> What will he say next,
O Ceres? How I tremble!</p>

<p><label>LYSIAS</label> Hearing the sound of
two persons breathing, I thought at
first that Lyde was with her. But I
felt a smooth, beardless chin, and a
head closely shaven and perfumed,
O Pythias! If I had had a sword at
that moment, be sure that I would
without hesitation have but what
are you laughing at? is it at what I
am saying?</p>

<p><label>IOESSA</label> So that is the cause of
all your ill-feeling, is it, Lysias? It
was Pythias who was in bed with me.</p>

<p><label>PYTHIAS</label> Oh! don't tell him,
loessa.

</p>

<pb n="181"/>

<p><label>IOESSA</label> Why not, pray? It was
Pythias, my love. I asked her to
pass the night with me, to lighten
the tedium of your absence.</p>

<p><label>LYSIAS</label> Do you mean that Pyth-
ias had a shaven head? Has she
grown such a head of hair as hers
in six days?</p>

<p><label>IOESSA</label> She had to have her
head shaved as the result of an
illness, because the hair was falling
off. Show him, Pythias, so that he
may be convinced. See! there's the
young spark you were jealous of.</p>

<p><label>LYSIAS</label> How could I help it,
loving you as I do, when I felt that
head?</p>

<p><label>IOESSA</label> But now you are satis-
fied; would you like me to take my

turn now and pay you off in your
own coin, by being angry with you,
and with more reason?</p>

<p><label>LYSIAS</label> No, my dear; let us sup
instead. Pythias shall join us, and
witness our reconciliation.</p>

<p><label>IOESSA</label> She shall remain. O
Pythias, handsomest of youths, how
I have suffered on your account!</p>

<p><label>PYTHIAS</label> True; but this same
handsome youth has brought you
together. So bear me no grudge.
And do you, Lysias, be sure to tell
no one what you know about my

Galatians, I darted bravely forth
I from the ranks, mounted on a white
charger, and how the foe, at sight

of me, terror-stricken despite their
courage, turned and fled, and no one
dared to face me. With a single cast
of the spear, I transfixed their leader
and his horse; then, sword in hand,
rushed upon the barbarians who
resisted, the shattered remnant of
the phalanx had formed a square,—
charged furiously upon them, and
seven in the foremost rank fell be-
fore my impetuous onset. With a
stroke of the sword, I clove the cap-
tain's skull, despite the thickness
of his helmet; and when you came
up, O Chenidas, the foe had fled.</p>

<p><label>CHENIDAS</label> And how you covered
yourself with glory, O Leontichus,
in Paphlagonia, in single combat
with the great satrap there!


</p>

<pb n="189"/>

<p><label>LEONTICHUS</label> You do well to re-
mind me of it. Yes, that was one
of my greatest feats. What a giant
that satrap was! he was said to be
one of the most expert in the game
of arms. Proud of his prowess, and
most contemptuous of everything
Greek, he came forth between the
two armies and challenged to single
combat whosoever should dare to
measure swords with him. All were
terrified, captains, colonels, even the
general himself, Aristaechmus the
AEtolian, the best javelin-thrower
in the army. Although I was only
a chiliarch, I accepted the challenge;
I tore myself from the arms of my
friends, who trembled for my life at
sight of that mammoth barbarian


<pb n="191"/>

covered with dazzling weapons,
shaking his plume and brandishing
his terrible spear to frighten us.</p>

<p><label>CHENIDAS</label> I trembled for you,
Leontichus. You remember that I
begged you not to expose your-
self to the danger, swearing that I
would not survive your death by
one instant.

</p>

<p><label>LEONTICHUS</label> I listened only to
my courage; encased in armor as
glittering as the Paphlagonian's, I
rushed forth to the battle-field.
shout of surprise arose from both
camps. Greeks and barbarians rec-
ognized me at once by my shield
and the crest on my helmet. Tell
us, O Chenidas, to whom I was
likened at that moment.


</p>

<pb n="193"/>

<p><label>CHENIDAS</label> By all the gods! to
whom, if not to Achilles, valiant son
of Thetis and Peleus? The same
proud bearing beneath the helmet;
your cloak was gorgeous, and your
shield dazzled the eyes.</p>

<p><label>LEONTICHUS</label> As soon as we
stood face to face, the barbarian
struck the first blow, and wounded
me slightly; the point of his spear
grazed my skin above the knee. And
I, with a thrust of my spear, pierced
his shield and entered his breast. He
fell, I leaped upon him and cut off his
head with a backhanded blow of my
sword. Having stripped him of his
arms, I returned in triumph to the
camp, covered with his blood, and with
his head on the point of my spear.


</p>

<pb n="195"/>

<p><label>HYMNIS</label> O Leontichus, how hor-
rible! all that you have told me is
shocking, execrable. I cannot look
at you without shuddering, when
you boast of such horrible blood-
shed. I will not drink or lie with
you again. I am going.</p>

<p><label>LEONTICHUS</label> I will give you
twice what I agreed.</p>

<p><label>HYMNIS</label> Oh! I shall never have
the heart to embrace a man who
kills other men !</p>

<p><label>LEONTICHUS</label> You are in no
danger, Hymnis. That happened in
Paphlagonia. I don't fight here.</p>

<p><label>HYMNIS</label> But you are a horrible
man. Think of the blood flowing
from that head on the end of your
spear! How can I embrace such a

man! I never will, I swear. Such
a man is as heartless as a hangman.</p>

<p><label>LEONTICHUS</label> Ah! I am sure that
you would love me, if you had seen
me under arms.</p>

<p><label>HYMNIS</label> No; I tremble and am
sick at heart simply from hearing
the story of your cruel deeds. I
fancy that I see about you the
ghosts of the unfortunate creatures
you have killed, and especially that
of the poor captain whose head
you cut in two. What would it
be if I had actually seen such a
ghastly spectacle, blood flowing and
dead bodies lying on the battle-
field? I should have died of fright,
I think, I who never saw a chicken
bleed.

chiliarchs; you may do murder now
at your pleasure.</p>

stay! She has gone!</p>

<p><label>CHENIDAS</label> It's your own fault;
you frightened the simple-hearted
child with your nodding crest and the
roaring of your incredible exploits.


<pb n="201"/>

I saw her turn pale at the beginning,
and while you were splitting the
captain's head open, her expression
changed, and she shuddered from
head to foot.</p>

<p><label>LEONTICHUS</label> I thought thus to
make myself more agreeable in her
eyes. But you contributed to my
undoing by suggesting the idea of
that duel.</p>

<p><label>CHENIDAS</label> Was I not bound
to bolster up your lies? I saw
through your swashbuckling, but
you made the battle too bloody. It
was enough to cut off the un-
happy Paphlagonian's head, without
sticking it on the end of a spear
and drenching yourself with his
blood.


</p>

<pb n="203"/>

<p><label>LEONTICHUS</label> That was rather
a disgusting touch, Chenidas; but
the rest of the battle was well con-
ceived. Run after her now, and try
to persuade her to come back and
pass the night with me.</p>

<p><label>CHENIDAS</label> Shall I tell her that
all your stories were mere fables,
invented as you went along, in
order to make yourself out a hero
in her eyes?</p>

<p><label>LEONTICHUS</label> That would be too
humiliating, Chenidas.</p>

<p><label>CHENIDAS</label> It's the only way to
induce her to come back. You can
take your choice: either retain your
reputation for great valor and be
I detested, or confess that you lied
and lie with Hymnis.

<pb n="205"/>

<p><label>LEONTICHUS</label> Either alternative
is painful; but I prefer to possess

that I am ruined, penniless, you

send me away! You have taken
for your lover that fat merchant
from Bithynia. In vain do I come
to your door and drench it with my
tears; he is the favored one now; he
alone enters your house and passes
whole nights there. They even say
that you are with child by him.</p>

<p><label>MYRTALE</label> Really, Dorio, I am
terribly tired of hearing you talk
about the handsome presents you
have made me, and about ruining
yourself for me. Count up what you
have given me during our intimacy,
and we will see.</p>

<p><label>DORIO</label> Very well, Myrtale; let
us count up. First, a pair of shoes
from Sicyonia, for which I paid two
drachmae; put down two drachmae.


</p>

<pb n="211"/>

<p><label>MYRTALE</label> True; but you passed
two nights with me.</p>

<p><label>DORIO</label> On my return from
Syria, an alabaster jar full of Pho-
nician perfumes; that, too, was worth
two drachmae, by Neptune!</p>

<p><label>MYRTALE</label> And when you sailed,
didn't I give you a tunic which came
to your knees, which Epiurus left at
my house? You were to wear it
when you had to row.</p>

<p><label>DORIO</label> Epiurus recognized it on
me not long ago in Samos, and took
it away from me in spite of all I
could do. I also brought you onions
from Cyprus, and five large fish and
four perch on my return from the
Bosphorus. What else?-Ah! yes,
eight ship-biscuits in their basket,


<pb n="213"/>

and a jar of Carian figs; and, a very
short time ago, a pair of gilded san-
dals from Patara, ungrateful woman!
and a huge cheese from Gythium.</p>

<p><label>MYRTALE</label> The worth of five
drachmae in all.</p>

<p><label>DORIO</label> What more could a poor
sailor do, who spends his life at
the oar? And you despise me still,
although I command one side of the
vessel. Didn't I lay a silver drachma
at the goddess's feet for you, at the
festival of Venus? And what about
the shoes worth two drachmae which
I gave your mother? And your maid
Lyde, whose fingers I grease some-
times with two obols, sometimes
with four? All these things together
would make a sailor's fortune.


</p>

<pb n="215"/>

<p><label>MYRTALE</label> The onions and the
fish, I suppose, Dorio?</p>

<p><label>DORIO</label> To be sure; I had noth-
ing else to give you. As if I should
be a rower, if I had any money! And
in all this time I've brought my own
mother nothing, not even a sprig of
garlic. I would like right well to
know what presents you have had
from your Bithynian.</p>

<p><label>MYRTALE</label> In the first place, this
frock; and then, this heavy necklace.</p>

<p><label>DORIO</label> That necklace? why, you
have had it an age, to my knowledge.</p>

<p><label>MYRTALE</label> No; that was a lighter
one,
without emeralds. Also, these
ear-rings and this rug; he has just
given me two minae too, and has paid
our rent. That's better than sandals


<pb n="217"/>

from Patara, Gythium cheese, and
Carian figs, eh?</p>

<p><label>DORIO</label> But you say nothing
about the physique of this gallant
lover whom you embrace every
night, this married man, fifty years
old at least, bald as your knee, and
green as a crab! And such teeth!
You should see him when he sings,
and tries to play the dandy! a jackass
playing the lyre! Take your fill of
him; you are a worthy mate for him.
May you have a brat who looks
like his father! I shall soon find a
Delphis or Cymbalium, or my neigh-

else. Every one can't supply rugs
and necklaces and sums of two
minae.

Crocale, I believe, had asked him for
two talents as the price of having
her to himself; when Dinomachus
refused, she shut the door in his
face, sent for Gorgos of OEnoe,—a
wealthy farmer, who has been in
love with her for a long time,-began
to drink with him, and sent for
me to play the flute for them. The
carousing was at its height; I struck
up a Lydian air, and our farmer
left the table and began to dance;
Crocale applauded, and everything
was very pleasant. Suddenly, we
heard a great noise and outcries;
the door was broken in, and eight
sturdy fellows rushed into the room
with the Megarian at their head.
They overturned everything, threw


<pb n="227"/>

themselves on Gorgos, as I have
told you, knocked him down, and
trampled on him. Crocale escaped,
I don't know how, and took refuge
with her neighbor Thespias. Dino-
machus, after cuffing me and break-
ing my pipes, threw them at my
head and bade me go to the devil.
I am going to tell the whole story
to my master, while the farmer has
gone to some friends in the city in
order to have the Megarian arrested.</p>

<p><label>COCHLIS</label> That's what one gets

constant quarrels and blows! To
hear them talk, you would say they
were all colonels or captains. But
if you try to touch their pockets-
"Wait," they say, "till we meet

again, and I have received my pay;
then you'll have no fault to find."—
The deuce take the braggarts! I
have good reasons for receiving none
of them. Fishermen, sailors, farm-
ers-they are good fellows! Few
fine words, but plenty of presents.
But I tell you, Parthenis, all these
beplumed blusterers, these describers
of battles, are mere vaporers, noisy
praters, nothing more!
