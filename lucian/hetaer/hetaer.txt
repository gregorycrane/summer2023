INTRODUCTION
LUCIAN
An eminent French Hellenist, and
a man of taste and refinement, Mon-
sieur Viguier, when he read and ex-
pounded to his pupils at the Normal
School Aristophanes or Lucian, those
two incorrigible and jovial jesters,
was himself, so it is said, a fit subject
for the painter. He did not attempt
to conceal his delight and surprise
at every page, stamping in ecstasy,
laughing and weeping at the same
moment, blushing when a succession
of exquisite details in the text was

INTRODUCTION
followed by some glaring enormity;
and he would exclaim, with charming
ingenuousness: "Ah! young gen-
tlemen, what rascals those Greeks
were, but how clever!"
It is because of this cleverness
that their works, despite the differ-
ence in the times and in morals,
continue to delight us to this day,
and have come down to us unscathed
through the Middle Ages. Lucian
incurred greater dangers than any
other in the transit. The monks,
when transcribing his manuscripts,
were often scandalized by what they
found therein. Atheist, blasphemer,
buffoon, impious dog, are the mildest
epithets with which they assailed
these inimitable dialogues, in their

notes. But, despite their diverting
wrath, which is attested by such a
wealth of anathemas, they surren-
dered to the charm of the diabolic
author, and preserved his works for
us. We should be deeply grateful to
them; such self-sacrificing devotion
to literary beauty must sometimes
have cost them very dear.
To present an accurate picture of
the morals of ancient times, we can
make no better selection than the
Dialogues of Courtesans, wherein so
many Greek female types are drawn
with so delicate and cunning a pen-
cil, with so light a touch. The plays
of Aristophanes give us simply a
caricature of life at Athens; the
characters of Theophrastus afford us

INTRODUCTION
only an abstract view of it; we must
read Lucian's dialogues to obtain a
living, speaking picture. All classes
of society, great and small, trades-
men, soldiers, sailors, and country-
men, appear in their turn, bearing
the stamp of perfect resemblance.
It is unnecessary to state that we
must not look to them for moral
precepts. And yet, the spectacle of
these petty domestic dramas is not
without useful lessons for one's
guidance. We learn to know life as
it is. Our age is much given, and
not unnaturally, to inquiring about
everybody who has lived and suf-
fered, about all the sentiments which
have stirred the souls of men or
made their hearts beat fast. To

obtain light upon its path, that it
may go straight to its goal with fewer
mistakes, it takes pleasure in study-
ing all previous experiences, even the
least innocent, if for no other pur-
pose than to ascertain their results
and avoid a repetition of them. And
where can we find a more diverting
satire upon feminine rascalities? Be-
neath the scepticism and licentious-
ness of his pictures, Lucian almost
always conceals a serious lesson.
The story of his life has been told
so often, and is so well known, that
we need do no more than mention
the main facts. Born at Samosata,
the chief town of the Syrian district
of Commagene, on the west bank of
the Euphrates, about A. D. 120, he

died, so it is conjectured, about
A. D. 200, having lived under Trajan,
Hadrian, the Antonines, and Com-
modus. His parents, having a bare
competence, apprenticed him to an
uncle, a sculptor;* but on the very
first day of his apprenticeship he
broke a marble slab, and was se-
verely chastised by his uncle. He
went home to his parents, in tears,
and persistently refused to return.
Shortly afterward, he had a dream,
in which Art and Literature argued
their claims, the latter being easily
victorious; thereupon, Lucian deter-
mined to take up literature as a

profession and to train himself to
become a professional orator or
sophist. After studying in the rhe-
torical schools of lonia, he practised
as an advocate at Antioch, and ob-
tained so great a reputation as a
forensic speaker that he adopted
the profession of sophist. In that
capacity, he travelled through Asia
Minor, Greece, Italy, and Gaul, sow-
ing everywhere the seeds of his
speech, and already trying his hand
at amusing criticisms of the pre-
vailing errors, superstitions, and re-
ligious beliefs. In Gaul he lived
more than ten years, and amassed
sufficient means to enable him to re-
tire. He returned to the East, found
his father still living at Samosata,

INTRODUCTION
and took him and his family to
Greece, where he lived at Athens in
comfort until the last years of his life.
During this period, he abandoned the
profession of sophist and devoted
himself to the study of philoso-
phy and to the composition of the
numerous works which have made
him immortal. About A. D. 196, his
diminishing means compelled him to
accept employment from the Em-
peror. Of his death nothing definite
is known, although there is a fable
that he was torn to pieces by dogs
for having blasphemed the name of
Christ.
"Lucian," says Professor Jebb,
"lived to write Attic prose which,
though by no means faultless, was

INTRODUCTION
the best that had been written for
four hundred years. His Dialogues
of the Gods, almost Homeric in their
freshness and almost Aristophanic
in their fun, bring out the ludicrous
side of the popular Greek faith; the
Dialogues of the Dead are brilliant
satires on the living. . . His
'Timon,' the misanthrope, is inter-
esting in connection with Shake-
speare's play. The Veracious History,
a mock narrative of travel, is the
original of such books as Gulliver's
Travels. Lucian has much in com-
mon with Swift, and more, perhaps,
with Voltaire."
What need is there to sing his
praises: his sturdy sense, spark-
ling with wit and verve, his pungent

INTRODUCTION
jesting, fortified and sharpened by
erudition, will always arouse ad-
miration.
A single voice, Saint-Evremond's,
has risen in protest against the gen-
eral concert of praise. It is, to be
sure, in a passage in which he is
striving to exalt Petronius, who, in
his opinion, spoke the language of
gallantry with more refinement. His
preference for the author of Satyricon
makes him unjust to Lucian, whom
he decries far too much. He even
goes so far as to rebuke him for the
freedom of his sketches.
"Lucian," he says, "ingenious as
he is, becomes vulgar as soon as he
begins to talk of love. His courte-
sans speak the language of public

course of the bed-chamber."
But that very thing is their prin-
cipal recommendation. We should
consider their chronicler a great fool
if he should put on their lips the high-
flown twaddle of the ultra-refined
coteries.
No less than seventy-nine separate
works, in addition to a few poems,
have come down to us bearing the
name of Lucian.

expected it. Such things are done
among us courtesans. So don't be
downcast, and don't blame Gorgona.
Abrotonum bore you no grudge for
the same trick, and you were good
friends too. What surprises me is
that the soldier can find anything
beautiful in Gorgona. Unless he is
blind, he can't help seeing that she
is almost bald, with only a few stray
hairs about her forehead; that her
lips are withered, her mouth like a
mummy's, her neck all skin and
bone, her veins swollen, and her
nose long and pointed. I can see
nothing fine about her but her
figure, which is not so very bad,
and her smile, which is very win-
ning.

"Pamphilus, you know Charmides,

he is about your age, and here he is
going to marry and reform. When
do you propose to cease to live with
a harlot ?"-I paid no heed, and went
to bed. This morning I came here
at daybreak, so that is why I saw
nothing of the preparation of which
Doris speaks. If you still doubt,
go back, Doris, look carefully, not
inside the house, but at the door

neighbor's door which is hung with
flowers.

courage, turned and fled, and no one
dared to face me. With a single cast
of the spear, I transfixed their leader
and his horse; then, sword in hand,
rushed upon the barbarians who
resisted, the shattered remnant of
the phalanx had formed a square,—
charged furiously upon them, and
seven in the foremost rank fell be-
fore my impetuous onset. With a
stroke of the sword, I clove the cap-
tain's skull, despite the thickness
of his helmet; and when you came
up, O Chenidas, the foe had fled.

of my greatest feats. What a giant
that satrap was! he was said to be
one of the most expert in the game
of arms. Proud of his prowess, and
most contemptuous of everything
Greek, he came forth between the
two armies and challenged to single
combat whosoever should dare to
measure swords with him. All were
terrified, captains, colonels, even the
general himself, Aristæchmus the
Ætolian, the best javelin-thrower
in the army. Although I was only
a chiliarch, I accepted the challenge;
I tore myself from the arms of my
friends, who trembled for my life at

your cloak was gorgeous, and your

LEONTICHUS.-As soon as we

struck the first blow, and wounded
me slightly; the point of his spear
grazed my skin above the knee. And
I, with a thrust of my spear, pierced
his shield and entered his breast. He
fell, I leaped upon him and cut off his
head with a backhanded blow of my
sword. Having stripped him of his

his head on the point of my spear.

SO. At such a distance of time, it
is difficult to be positive as to such
delicate points. What is more cer-

possession, it is said, of Lysicles, a

transformed that cattle-trader into
an orator, that stupid lover into a
political power.
Monsieur Emile Deschanel, from
whom this last anecdote is borrowed,
has very happily described the part
played by the courtesan in Greek
society:
"In the intercourse of those tal-

women, there was an intellectual, if
not a moral, advantage for both.
The men gave the women solidity

gave the men that flexibility of
mind, that penetration, that knowl-
edge of human nature, which are
instinctive with them. The women,
especially, had everything to gain
by contact with those great minds.
We know how prompt women are to
imitate, unintentionally and uncon-
sciously, how quickly they adopt
the sentiments, ideas, and expres-
sions, the tricks of speech and of
intonation, the gestures and atti-
tudes, of those with whom they live.
The minds of the courtesans were
magnetized by that contact. They
gained, in that intercourse, new
ideas, energy of action and expres-
sion, and brilliancy of style.

money of the one class, they embel-

with the wit of the others, combined

stage-setting of their conversation

Although it has been asserted

neither their reputations nor their

mythology had absolved them be-

some curious details concerning the
strange refinements of luxury and
gallantry which they introduced at
Cyprus. On occasion, however, there
was ill-natured, but always witty,
opposition to their claims. One of
them having informed Aristippus
that she was with child by him, he

It will be readily believed that they

The greatest misfortune which
could befall them was to fall pas-

scorned them and thus made them
atone for all the tears they had

Lais loved Eubates, the athlete, so

not to go away without her; he
swore that he would not, and, to
avoid breaking his oath, took her
portrait with him.-When beauty for-

the young man told her, tried to turn
him aside from his purpose by re-
fusing to gratify his passion. At
last, finding that the young man did
not lose courage, she told him that
she would consent to make him
happy if he would bring her a very
famous necklace belonging to Bac-
chis. The young man hesitated at
first; then, in the ardor of his pas-
sion for Plangon, he threw himself
at Bacchis's feet, imploring her with
such artless eloquence not to con-
demn him to death, that she acceded

necklace. The courtesan Plangon,
touched by the noble generosity of
the courtesan Bacchis, sent the neck-
lace back to her and took the young
man to her arms. From that mo-
ment, the two women of pleasure
became the best of friends and
shared their young lover between
them.

ornaments they set off their charms?
Read in the Greek Anthology the
epigram of Leonidas of Tarentum
concerning the courtesan Calliclea:
"A silver Cupid, a fringe for the
ankle, that Lesbian tower of dark
hair, a transparent fillet to support
the breast, a bronze mirror, a broad

While the intellects of other women
were sunk to the level of the most
absurd superstitions, those of the
courtesans rose to the higher veri-
ties of philosophy. Such liberty of
thought tended, it is true, to produce
moral licentiousness; the person who
does not believe in the gods or in a
future life has no reason to mortify
his senses. One of the sisterhood,
Hipparchia by name, fell in love with
a Cynic, the hunchback Crates, who
was very poor. She left all to follow

her kindred. To Crates, who re-
minded her of his deformity and his
poverty, she replied that she could
not find a comelier or a richer hus-
band, and that she gave herself
to him. The philosopher took her to
the Pocile, the most frequented spot
in Athens, and consummated his
marriage there in broad daylight, in
everybody's sight. Luckily, a friend
was ashamed for him and threw his
cloak over them.

There were two Aspasias. The
second was from Phocæa, and was
called Milto. She did not change her
name until she became the favorite
sultana of Cyrus the Younger. Ac-
cording to Ælian and Plutarch, she
was of a most seductive type of
beauty: curly, fair hair, large ex-
pressive eyes, a small ear, white
teeth, lovely red lips, delicate skin,
hands and feet of perfect shape,
and a voice as soft and sweet as a

usual effect: it inflamed the prince's
passion, and he, in order to over-

The part played by courtesans
continued to be of great importance
beyond the period of Hellenic domi-
nation. When Rome seized upon
Greece and the Orient, they avenged
their country to some extent and
subjugated its conquerors. To be
convinced of this, it is enough to
read the decrees issued by Verres
during his prætorship. It would be
impossible to understand his capri-
cious despotism, did we not know
that a Greek courtesan, one Chelido,
governed him absolutely, and de-
cided all suits in advance, in accord-
ance with her caprice or her interest.

Apollodorus, Ammonius, Antipha-

wrote complete works on the subject
of courtesans. Æschines, a disci-
ple of Socrates, and Antisthenes
each wrote a book concerning Aspa-
sia; but all of these are lost. Out-
side of Lucian, we have no source of
knowledge of their adventures and
their bons mots, save the tales of
Athenæus and the imaginary post

tænetus. The work of the last-
named bears some analogy to the
unsubstantial and licentious pro-

youth, Praxiteles became enamored
of her. First, he carved for her a
Cupid, which was set up at Thespiæ,
her birthplace. Later, he made a
statue of her in gold, which adorned
the temple at Delphi, where it stood
upon a column of Pentelic marble.
She served as the model, according

privileged to gaze upon it became
so enamored of it that, not content
with covering it with valuable gifts,
he asked that it be given him in
marriage, and promised, if his prayer
were granted, to give the Cnidians
even more splendid gifts. Although
they did not accept his offers, they
were enchanted by a mad freak
which did honor to their goddess and

We can form some idea of the
charms of Phryne, charms capable,
it is said, of restoring to an enfeebled
Argonaut sufficient energy to recon-
quer the Golden Fleece, by her effigy
on the coins of Cnidus. It is true that
Greek engravers have the reputation
of not reproducing their models with
the most scrupulous accuracy.
According to Athenæus, Phryne
was especially perfect in those parts
which are not seen. Wherefore, the
coquette obstinately refused to dis-
play herself unclothed, avoiding the
public baths, and keeping her body
carefully swathed in a long tunic.
On two occasions, however, she con-
sented to reveal her charms to the
eyes of the wonderstricken Greeks.

Venus Anadyomene, a nude figure.
A poet, Leonidas of Tarentum, at-

animation of the portrait, which dis-
appeared long ages since.-"Just
emerging from her mother's bosom,
and still all quivering with foam,
when Apelles saw the sweet Cyp-

abandon the contest.'"
The second exhibition took place
before the Areopagus. Phryne, be-
ing summoned before that tribunal
for some prank, had intrusted her
defence to Hyperides the orator.
He resorted to an entirely novel
method of procuring her acquit-
tal. By way of peroration, he sud-
denly put aside the courtesan's tunic
and uncovered her breast. Such
an argument was irresistible when

addressed to the eyes of Athenian
magistrates; they saw, and they ab-

Phryne herself seems to have had
elevated tastes and the sentiment
of patriotism. She offered to rebuild
Thebes with the revenue derived
from her charms, on condition that
these words should be inscribed on
the walls: Phryne rebuilt Thebes,
which Alexander destroyed.
Lais's figure also served the sculp-
tors and painters of her day as a
model. Apelles, having seen her in
early youth drawing water from the
fountain of Pirenus, divined what
she would be in her maturer years,
and took her with him to a banquet

they joked him on account of the

Unluckily, all these masterpieces
of Grecian art inspired by courte-
sans have disappeared, with a single
exception, a Hermes, representing
Aspasia veiled, which may be seen
in the Pio-Clementino Museum at
the Vatican. This statue was dis-
covered at Castro-Nuovo. There is
no doubt as to its authenticity, for
the courtesan's name is written in
Greek at the foot. But, as its title
indicates, we cannot be sure whether.
it reproduces exactly the type of
beauty attributed to the original.

SCULPTURE
The most charming representa-
tion of Phryne in modern times we
owe to the chisel of Pradier. His
statue, exhibited in the Salon of 1845,
aroused a very warm discussion.
The criticism was made that his
figure was not passionate enough,
that it was too conventional and
lacked impressiveness. It was at
that time that some one made the
remark, so often repeated since, that
"Pradier started for Cythera, but
stopped at the Quartier Bréda.”—
Despite these criticisms, the statue
is one of the most beautiful and
most artistically executed products
of French sculpture. The courtesan

is represented standing, and uncov-
ering, with a graceful gesture, the
marvels of her beauty. One hand
raised above her head and the other
held against her breast support a
clinging garment carved with the
utmost delicacy. Above that bust,
palpitating with life, rises the beau-
tiful, dreamy face. The composi-
tion is harmonious throughout. The
artist's idea of decorating the hem of
the drapery with Greek embroidery
colored blue also caused a great
outcry. "Why debase the majesty
of such an art by servile imitation?
There is no reason for stopping when
one has started on that road. Soon
we shall have imitations of the color
of the hair and of fabrics, of flesh

tints, etc."-They who upheld so
hotly the dignity of sculpture seem
to have forgotten that Pradier sim-
ply followed his Greek predecessors
in that respect. But routine has
proved too strong, and all subse-
quent essays in the same line, to
impart to the marble more veri-
similitude and life, have thus far
failed to secure marked approval.
The same subject was treated by
Elias Robert in 1855, and by Loison in
1865. Their statues are noteworthy
for their voluptuous expression, but

In 1849, Mathieu Meusnier exhib-
ited a statue in marble, the Death of
Lais, which represents the courte-
san just as she falls beside the altar

of Venus, pursued by the Thessalian
women.
Ten years later, Cambon produced
another Lais, standing, in all the
splendor and serenity of her beauty,
with the right hand against the
breast, and the left playing with
the pearls of her necklace.
Lastly, M. D. Thabard exhibited
in 1875 a marble statue of Lais,
intended for the courtyard of the
Louvre.
PAINTING
Among the most famous pictures
connected with our subject, we must
mention, first of all, Paul Veronese's
Portrait of Alexander's Mistress.
It represents the head and bust,

one-fourth profile, looking the spec-
tator in the face. The head is bare,
the hair raised behind. The neck
of the chemise is open, showing a
part of her breast. Engraved by
J.-B. Boyer d'Aguillon.
M. Paul Mantz, in his excellent
monograph upon Hans Holbein, men-
tions the portrait which that great
artist painted of his mistress, Doro-
thea Offenburg, who desired to be
represented as Lais. Although she
was young and graceful, her nose
was a trifle long, and the artist, con-
scientious though he was, felt bound
to flatter her. He painted her head
and bust, in full courtesan's toilet,
with bare shoulders, the breast partly
uncovered, the effect of the white

flesh being heightened by greenish
drapery. Before her lie divers gold
pieces, for the allegory is complete,
and at the bottom of the picture, in
characters large enough to attract
the eye: Lais Corinthiaca, 1526.
Among the works of Van Dyck we
find the Garden of Love, a group of
lovers lying about under draperies
among the trees. The idea is bor-
rowed from a Bacchanal by Titian.
A landscape by Rubens, known by
the name of the Garden of Pleasure,
has been engraved by J. Mathan.
We owe to the brush of Salvator
Rosa a Phryne and Xenocrates the

reproduced with the graving-tool.
There is also a picture with the

at the Faragina Palace, Genoa.
The Embarkation for the Isle of
Cythera by Antoine Watteau is not
so licentious as its title would seem
to indicate. At the right is a pilgrim
kneeling beside a woman, seated,
with downcast eyes, and a fan in her
hand. A Cupid astride his quiver is
pulling the hem of her dress. Near
the centre of the canvas stands a
man trying to raise a half-prostrate
woman, both of whose hands he
holds. Farther to the left is an-
other pilgrim, with his arm about a
woman's waist, leading her down
from the top of a low hill, her face
'being turned toward the group last
described. A small dog follows them.

All these people, attended by a flut-
tering flock of Cupids, are headed
toward a gilded bark, decorated with
flowers, and rowed by two nude
sailors, who lean on their oars. In
the background, a stream flows be-
tween wooded hills. This picture
has been popularized by Tardieu's
engraving. At the Exposition Uni-
verselle of 1878, there was exhibited
a large picture on Sèvres porcelain
by Abel Schill, after Watteau. The
French government presented it to
the Prince of Wales.

"What can you expect that man to
put upon his canvas?" wrote Dide-
rot. "What else than what he has
in his imagination? and what can a
man have in his imagination who
passes his life with prostitutes of
the lowest order?" That is a very
harsh judgment. It might be applied
to certain passages in Diderot's own
work; but we pass on.

his decree in fewer words." It is,"
he says, a fine subject treated in
a feeble and commonplace manner.
The arrangement is faulty, it seems
to me, because the effect sought re-
quires the isolation of the accused
and the orator. Phryne's manner
is contemptible: she shrinks, she is
ashamed, she trembles, she is afraid.
The woman who dares to defy the
gods should not be afraid to die.
He ought to have shown her to us
from head to foot, at the moment
when the orator thrust aside the veil
that covered her head; we should
see her lovely shoulders, her lovely
arms, her lovely breast; and I would
have had her attitude express her
concurrence in the actions and words

Every one knows the story of
Campaspe the Theban, mistress of
Alexander, at whose bidding Apelles
painted her portrait. The artist be-
came so enamored of his subject's
charms that he fell ill. Alexander
gave her to him for his wife, to cure
him. A painter of licentious sub-
jects, Girodet, represented the inci-
dent in a picture which has been
engraved by Jean Bein.

Courtesan, which deserves a few
lines of description. The young
woman, dressed in the style of the
sixteenth century, with a black cap
adorned by a white plume, is drawn
one-fourth profile, receiving with one
hand a casket of jewels presented
by a man of middle age, while in the
other she holds the letter which a
youth has just handed her, and in
which we can read the words: All'
idolo del mio cuore.-To my heart's
idol.-Behind her stands a negress,
with her finger on her lips, bidding
the younger man hold his peace.
This picture has been engraved by
Reynolds.

of beauty which he gave the cour-
tesan is much more modern than
antique. Laying aside the moral
question, which is of no consequence
in the matter of art, we have no
word of reproach for the artist ex-
cept as to his choice of a model.
Instead of a Grecian woman with
a figure powerful in its very grace,
he placed upon his canvas a buxom
lorette, with prominent hips, and
with a pouting expression and mock-
modest attitude which smack too
much of affectation. But there are
charming details which atone for the
inferiority of the principal figure.
For example, the attitude of Hyper-
ides, who still holds in his hand the

The same subject was painted by
Victor Robert in 1846, by L. Tabar
