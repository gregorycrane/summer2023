<head>PHALARIS<note>This piece and its fellow should not be taken as a serious attempt to whitewash Phalaris and to excuse Delphi for accepting a tainted gift. They are good specimens of the stock of a rhetorician, and something more. To put yourself in another man’s shoes and say what he would have said was a regular exercise of the schools, but to laugh in your sleeve as you said it was not the way of the ordinary rhetorician.</note></head>

<p>
Men of Delphi, we have been sent by our ruler
Phalaris to bring your god this bull, and to say to
you what should be said about Phalaris himself and
about his gift. That is why we are here, then; and
what he told us to tell you is this:
‘For my part, men of Delphi, to have all the
Greeks think me the sort of man I am, and not the
sort that rumour, coming from those who hate and
envy me, has made me out to the ears of strangers,
would please me better than anything else in the
world ; above all, to have you think me what I am,
as you are priests and associates of Apollo, and
(one might almost say) live in his house and under
his roof-tree. I feel that if I clear myself before you
and convince you that there was no reason to think
me cruel, I shall have cleared myself through you
before the rest of the Greeks. And I call your god.
himself to witness what I am about to say. Of


<pb n="5"/>

course he cannot be tripped by fallacies and misled
by falsehoods : for although mere men are no doubt
easy to cheat, a god (and above all this god) cannot
be hoodwinked.
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="2"><p>
‘I was not one of the common people in Acragas,
but was as well-born, as delicately brought up and as
thoroughly educated as anyone. Never at any time
did I fail to display public spirit toward the city, and
discretion and moderation toward my fellow-citizens ;
and no one ever charged me with a single violent,
tude, insolent, or overbearing action in the early
period of my life. But when I saw that the men of
the opposite party were plotting against me and trying in every way to get rid of me—our city was
split into factions at the time—I found only one means
of escape and safety, in which lay also the salvation
of the city: it was to put myself at the head of the
state, curb those men and check their plotting, and
force the city to be reasonable. As there were not
a few who commended this plan, men of sense and
patriotism who understood my purpose and the
necessity of the coup, I made use of their assistance
and easily succeeded.
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="3"><p>
‘From that time on the others made no more
trouble, but gave obedience ; I ruled, and the city
was free from party strife. Executions, banishments
and confiscations I did not employ even against the
former conspirators, although a man must bring
<pb n="7"/>

himself to take such measures in the beginning
of a reign more than at any other time. I had
marvellous hopes of getting them to listen to me
by my humanity, mildness and good-nature, and
through the impartiality of my favour. At the
outset, for instance, I came to an understanding
with my enemies and laid aside hostility, taking
most of them as counsellors and intimates. As for
the city, perceiving that it had been brought to
rack and ruin through the neglect of those, in office,
because everybody was robbing or rather plundering
the state, I restored it by building aqueducts,
adorned it with buildings and strengthened it with
walls ; the revenues of the state I readily increased
through the diligence of my officials; I cared for
the young, provided for the old, and entertained
the people with shows, gifts, festivals and banquets.
Even to hear of girls wronged, boys led astray,
wives carried off, guardsmen with warrants, or .any
form of despotic threat made me throw up my hands
in horror.

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="4"><p> I was already planning to resign my
office and lay down my authority, thinking only how
one might stop with safety ; for being governor and
managing everything began to seem to me unpleasant
in itself and, when attended by jealousy, a burden
to the flesh. I was still seeking, however, to ensure
that the city would never again stand in need of
such ministrations. But while I in my simplicity
was engaged in all this, the others were already
combining against me, planning the manner of their
plot and uprising, organizing bands of conspirators,
collecting arms, raising money, asking the aid of
men in neighbouring towns, and sending embassies
7
<pb n="9"/>

to Greece, to the Spartans and the Athenians.
What they had already resolved to do with me
if they caught me, how they had threatened to tear
me to pieces with their own hands, and what
punishments they had devised for me, they confessed in public on the rack. For the fact that
I met no such fate I have the gods to thank, who
exposed the plot: above all, Apollo, who showed me
dreams and also sent me men to interpret them
fully.

‘At this point I ask you, men of Delphi, to
imagine yourselves now as alarmed as I was then,
and to give me your advice as to what I should have
done when I had almost been taken off my guard -
and was trying to save myself from the situation.
Transport yourselves, then, in fancy to my city of
Acragas for a while; see their preparations, hear
their threats, and tell me what to do. Use them
with humanity? Spare them and put up with them
when I am on the point of meeting my death the
very next moment—nay, proffer my naked throat,
and see my nearest and dearest slain before my
eyes? Would not that be sheer imbecility, and should
not I, with high and manly resolution and the anger
natural to a man of sense who has been wronged,
bring those men to book and provide for my own
future security as best I may in the situation?
That is the advice that I know you would have
given me.

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="6"><p>
‘Well, what did I do then? I summoned the
men implicated, gave them a hearing, brought in the
evidence, and clearly convicted them on each count;

<pb n="11"/>

and then, as they themselves no longer denied the
charge, I avenged myself, angry in the main, not
because they had plotted against me, but because
they had not let me abide by the plan which I had
made in the beginning. From that time I have
continued to protect myself and to punish those of
my opponents who plot against me at any time.
And then men charge me with cruelty, forgetting to
consider which of us s began it! Suppressing all that
-went before, which caused them to be punished,
they always censured the punishments in themselves
and their seeming cruelty. It is as if someone
among yourselves should see a temple-robber thrown
over the cliff, and should not take into account what
he had dared to do—how he had entered the temple
at night, had pulled down the offerings, and had laid
hands on the image—but should accuse you of great
barbarity on the ground that you, who call yourselves
Greeks and priests, countenanced the infliction of -
such a punishment on a fellow-Greek hard by the
temple (for they say that the cliff is not very far
from the city). Why, you yourselves will laugh at
any man who makes this charge against you, I am
sure ; and the rest of the world will praise you for
your severity towards the impious.

‘Peoples in general, without trying to find out
what sort of man the head of the state is, whether
just or unjust, simply hate the very name of tyranny,
and even if the tyrant is an Aeacus, a Minos or a
Rhadamanthus they make every effort to put him
out of the way just the same, for they fix their
eyes on the bad tyrants and include the good in
equal hatred by reason of the common title. Yet
I hear that among you Greeks there have been many

<pb n="13"/>

wise tyrants who, under a name of ‘ill-repute have
shown a good and kindly character; and even that
brief sayings of some of them are deposited in your
temple as gifts and oblations to Pythius.

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="8"><p>
‘You will observe that legislators lay most
- stress on the punitive class of measures, naturally
because no others are of any use if unattended by
fear and the expectation of punishment. With us
tyrants this is all the more necessary because we
govern by force and live among men who ‘not only
hate us but plot against us, in an environment where
even the bugaboos we set up do not help us. Our
case is like the story of the Hydra: the more heads
we lop, the more occasions for punishing grow up
under our eyes. We must needs make the best
of it and lop each new growth—yes, and sear it, too,
like Iolaus,<note>The helper of Hercules in the story.</note> if we are to hold the upper hand; for
when a man has once been forced into a situation ot
this sort, he must adapt himself to his réle or lose
his life by being merciful to his neighbours. In
general, do you suppose that any man is so barbarous and savage as to take pleasure in flogging,
in hearing groans and in seeing men slaughtered,
if he has not some good reason for punishing?
How many times have I not shed tears while others
were being flogged? How many times have I not
been forced to lament and bewail my lot in undergoing greater and more protracted punishment than
they? When a man is kindly by nature and harsh
by necessity, it is much harder for him to punish
than to be punished.

‘For my part, if I may speak freely, in case I
were offered the choice between inflicting unjust
punishment and being put to death myself, you
may be very certain that without delay I should
choose to die rather than to punish the innocent.
But if someone should say: ‘ Phalaris, choose between
meeting an unjust death and inflicting just punishment on conspirators, I should choose the latter ;
for—-once more I call upon you for advice, men
of Delphi—is it better to be put to death unjustly,
or to pardon conspirators unjustly? Nobody, surely,
is such a simpleton as not to prefer to live rather
than to pardon his enemies and die. But how many
men who made attempts on me and were clearly
convicted of it have I not pardoned in spite of
everything? So it was with Acanthus, whom you
see before you, and Timocrates and his brother
Leogoras, for I remembered my old-time friendship
with them.
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="10"><p>
‘When you wish to know my side, ask the
strangers who visit Acragas how I am with them, and
whether I treat visitors kindly. Why, I even have
watchmen at the ports, and agents to enquire who
people are and where they come from, so that I may
speed them on their way with fitting honours. Some
(and they are the wisest of the Greeks) come to see
me of their own free will instead of shunning my
society. For instance, just the other day the wise
man Pythagoras came to us; he had heard a
different’ story about me, but when he had seen
what I was like he went away praising me for my
justice and pitying me. for my necessary severity.
Then do you think that a man who is kind to


<pb n="17"/>

foreigners would treat his fellow-countrymen so
harshly if he had not been exceptionally wronged ?

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="11"><p>
‘So much for what I had to say to you in my
own behalf: it is true and just and, I flatter myself,
merits praise rather than hatred. As for my gift, it
is time you heard where and how I got this bull. I
did not order it of the sculptor myself—I hope I
may never be so insane as to want such things !—but
there was a man in our town called Perilaus, a good
metal-worker but a bad man, Completely missing
my point of view, this fellow thought to do me a
favour by inventing a new punishment, imagining
that I wanted to punish people in any and every
way. So he made the bull and came to me with it,
a very beautiful thing to look at and a very close
copy of nature ; motion and voice were all it needed
to make it seem actually alive. At the sight of it I
cried out at once: “The thing is good enough for
Apollo; we must send the bull to the god!” But
Perilaus at my elbow said: “What if you knew the
trick of it and the purpose it serves?” . With that
he opened the bull’s back and said: “If you wish
to punish anyone, make him get into this contrivance
and lock him up; then attach these flutes to the
nose of the bull and have a fire lighted underneath.
The man will groan and shriek in the grip of unremitting pain, and his voice will make you the
sweetest possible music on the flutes, piping dolefully
and lowing piteously ; so that while he is punished
you are entertained by having flutes played to you.”

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="12"><p>

When I heard this I was disgusted with the wicked
ingenuity of the fellow and hated the idea of the

<pb n="19"/>

contrivance, so I gave him a punishment that fitted,
his crime. “Come now, Perilaus,” said I, “if this is
not mere empty boasting, show us the real nature of
the invention by getting into it yourself and imitating people crying out, so that we may know whether
the music you speak of ig really made on the flutes.”
Perilaus complied, and when he was inside, I locked
him up and had a fire kindled underneath, saying:
“Take the reward you deserve for your wonderful
invention, and as you are our music-master, play the
first tune yourself !” So he, indeed, got his deserts
by thus having the enjoyment of his own ingenuity.
But I had the fellow taken out while he -was still
alive and breathing, that he might not pollute the
work by dying in it; then I had him thrown over a
cliff to lie unburied, and after purifying the bull,
sent it to you to be dedicated to the god. I also
had the whole story inscribed on it—my name as the
- giver; that of Perilaus, the maker; his idea; my
justice ; the apt punishment ; the songs of the clever
metal-worker and the first trial of the music.

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="13"><p>
‘You will do what is right, men of Delphi, if
you offer sacrifice in my behalf with my ambassadors,
and if you set the bull up in a fair place in the
temple-close, that all may know how I deal with bad
men and how I requite their extravagant inclinations
toward wickedness. Indeed, this affair of itself is
enough to show my character: Perilaus was punished,
the bull was dedicated without being kept to pipe
when others were punished and without having
played any other tune than the bellowings of its


<pb n="21"/>

maker, and his case sufficed me to try the invention
and put an end to that uninspired, inhyman music.
At present, this is what I offer the god, but I shall
make many other gifts as soon as he permits me to
dispense with punishments.’

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="14"><p>
This, men of Delphi, is the message from Phalaris,
all of it true and everything just as‘ it took place.
You would be justified in believing our testimony,
as we know the facts and have never yet had the
reputation of being untruthful. But if it is necessary
to resort to entreaty on behalf of a man who has
been wrongly thought wicked and has been compelled to punish people against his will, then we, the
people of Acragas, Greeks of Dorian stock, beseech
you to grant him access to the sanctuary, for he
wishes to be your friend and is moved to confer
many benefits on each and all of yon, both public
and private. Take the bull then; dedicate it, and
pray for Acragas and for Phalaris himself. Do not
send us away unsuccessful or insult him or deprive
the god of an offering at once most beautiful and
most fitting.
</p></div></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="book" n="2">
<head>II</head>
<div type="textpart" subtype=" section" n="1">


<p>
I am neither an official representative of the
people of Acragas, men of Delphi, nor a personal
representative of Phalaris himself, and I have no
private ground at all for good-will to him and no
expectation of future friendship. But after listening
to the reasonable and temperate story of the ambassadors who have come from him, I rise in the

<pb n="23"/>

interests of religion, of our common good and, above
all, of the dignity of Delphi to exhort you neither
to insult a devout monarch nor to put away a gift
already pledged to the god, especially as it will be
for ever a memorial of three very significant things—
beautiful workmanship, wicked inventiveness, and
just punishment.

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="2"><p>
for you to hesitate about
this matter at all and to submit us the question
whether we should receive the gift or send it back
again—even this I, for my part, consider impious ;
indeed, nothing short of extreme sacrilege, for the
business is nothing else than temple-robbery, far
more serious than other forms of it because it is
more impious not to allow people to make gifts
when they will than to steal gifts after they are
made.

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="3"><p>
A man of Delphi myself and an equal participant
in our public good name if we maintain it and in ~
our disrepute if we acquire it from the present case,
I beg you neither to lock the temple to worshippers
nor to give the world a bad opinion of the city as
one that quibbles over things sent the god, and tries
givers by ballot and jury. No one would venture to
give in future if he knew that the god would not
accept anything not previously approved by the men
of Delphi.

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="4"><p>

As a matter of fact, Apollo has already
voted justly about the gift. At any rate, if he hated
Phalaris or loathed his present, he could easily have
sunk it in the middle of the Ionian sea, along with
the ship that carried it. But, quite to the contrary,


<pb n="25"/>

he vouchsafed them a calm passage, they say, and a
safe arrival at Cirrha.

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="5"><p>

By this it is clear that he
accepts the monarch’s worship. You must cast the
same vote as he, and add this bull to the other
attractions of the temple: for it would be most preposterous that a’man who has sent so magnificent a
present to our god should get the sentence of
exclusion from the sanctuary and should be paid for
his piety by being pronounced unworthy even to
make an oblation.

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="6"><p>

The man who. holds the contrary opinion ranted
about the tyrant’s murders and assaults and
robberies and abductions as if he had just put into
port from Acragas, all but saying that he had been
an eye-witness; we know, however, that he has not
even been as far from ‘home as the boat. We
should not give such stories full credence even when
told by those who profess to be the victims, for it is
doubtful whether they are telling the truth. Much
less should we ourselves play the accuser in matters of
which we have no knowledge.

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="7"><p>

But even if something of the sort has actually taken place in Sicily,
we of Delphi need not trouble ourselves about it,
unless we now want to be judges instead of priests,
and when we should be sacrificing and performing
the other divine services and helping to dedicate
whatever anyone sends us, sit and speculate whether
people on the other side of the Ionian sea are ruled
justly or unjustly.

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="8"><p>
Let the situation of others be as it may: we, in
my opinion, must needs realize our own situation—
what it was of old, what it is now, and what we can
do to better it. That we live on crags and cultivate


<pb n="27"/>

rocks is something we need not wait for Homer to
tell us—anyone can see it for himself.<note n="1">“Rocky Pytho” is twice mentioned in the Iliad (2, 519;
9, 405). But Lucian is thinking particularly of the Homeric
Hymn to Apollo, toward the close of which (526f.) the
Cretans whom Apollo has settled at Delphi ask him haw they
are to live; "for here is no lovely vine-land or fertile glebe.”
He tells them that they have only to slaughter sheep, and all
that_men bring him shall be theirs.</note> As far as
the land is concerned, we should always be cheek by
jow] with starvation: the temple, the god, the oracle,
the sacrificers and the worshippers—these are the
grain-lands of Delphi, these are our revenue, these
are the sources of our prosperity and of our subsistence. We-should speak the truth among ourselves,
at any rate! “Unsown and untilled,”<note n="2"> Homer, Od. 9, 109; 123.</note> as the poets
say, everything is grown for us with the god for our
husbandman. Not only does he vouchsafe us the
good things found among the Greeks, but every
product of the Phrygians, the Lydians, the Persians,
the Assyrians, the Phoenicians, the Italians and even
the Hyperboreans comes to Delphi. And next to
the god we are held in honour by all men, and we
are prosperous and happy. Thus it was of old, thus
it has been till now, and may we never cease leading
this life !

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="9"><p>

Never in the memory of any man have we taken
avote on a gift, or prevented anyone from sacrificing
or giving. For this very reason, I think, the temple
has prospered extraordinarily and is excessively rich
in gifts. Therefore we ought not to make any
innovation in the present case and break precedents
by setting up the practice of censoring gifts and
looking into the pedigree of things that are sent


7
<pb n="29"/>

here, to see where they come from and from whom,
and what they are: we should receive them and
dedicate them without officiousness, serving bothparties, the god and the worshippers.

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="10"><p>

It seems to me, men of Delphi, that you will
come to the best conclusion about the present case
if you should consider the number and the magnitude
of the issues involved in the question—first, the god,
the temple, sacrifices, gifts, old. customs, timehonoured observances and the credit of the oracle ;
then the whole-city and-the interests not only of
our body but of every man in Delphi; and more
than all, our good or bad name in the world. I
have no doubt that if you are in -your senses you
will think nothing more important or more vital than
these issues.

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="11"><p>
This is what we are in consultation about, then:
it is not Phalaris (a single tyrant) or. this bull
of bronze only, but all kings and all monarchs who
now frequent the temple, and gold and silver and all
other things of price that will be given the god on
many occasions. The first point to be investigated
should be the interest of the god. Why: should
we not manage the matter of gifts as we have always
done, as we did in the beginning?

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="12"><p>

What fault
have we to find with the good old customs, that we
should make innovations, and that we should now
set up a practice that has never existed among us
since the city has been inhabited, since our god has
given oracles, since the tripod has had a voice and
since the priestess has been inspired—the practice
of trying and cross-examining givers? In consequence
<pb n="31"/>

of that fine old custom of unrestricted -access for
all, you see how many good things fill the temple :
all men give, and some are more generous to the
god than their means warrant.

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="13"><p>
But if you make
yourselves examiners and inquisitors upon gifts, I
doubt we shall be in want of people to examine
hereafter, for nobody has the courage to put himself
on the defensive, and to stand trial and risk everything as a result of spending his money lavishly.
Who can endure life, if he is pronounced unworthy
to make an oblation?

Among wise men, I maintain, the most praiseworthy are they who not only have spoken cleverly
on their particular subjects, but have made their
assertions good by doing things to match them.
Take doctors, for instance: a man of sense, on falling
ill, does not send for those who can talk about their
profession best, but for those who have trained
themselves to accomplish something in it. Likewise a
musician who can himself play the lyre and the cithara
is better, surely, than one who simply has a good ear
for rhythm and harmony. And why need I tell you
that the generals who have been rightly judged’ the
best were good not only at marshalling their forces
and addressing them, but at heading charges and at
doughty deeds? Such, we know, were Agamemnon
and Achilles of old, Alexander and Pyrrhus more
recently.

Halys dryshod, thanks to his ingenuity brought the
river round behind the camp in a single night.
Yet he was not an engineer: he was wise, however, and very able at devising plans and grasping
problems. . As for the case of Epeius, it is prehistoric :
he is said not only to have made the wooden horse
for the Achaeans but to have gone into it along
with them.
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="3"><p>

Among these men Hippias, our own contemporary, deserves mention. Not only is he trained as
highly in the art of speech as any of his predecessors,
and alike quick of comprehension and clear in exposition, but he is better at action than speech, and fulfils
his professional promises, not merely doing so in those
matters in which his predecessors succeeded in
getting to the fore, but, as the geometricians put it,
knowing how to construct a triangle accurately on a
given base.<note n="1">In other words, he has originality.</note> Moreover, whereas each of the others
marked off some one department of science and
sought fame in it, making a name for himself in
spite of this delimitation, he, on the contrary, is
clearly a leader in harmony and music as well as in
engineering and geometry, and yet he shows as



<pb n="39"/>

great perfection in each of these fields as if he knew
nothing else. It would take no little time to sing
his praises in the doctrine of rays and refraction and
mirrors, or in astronomy, in which he made his predecessors appear’ children,

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="4"><p>

but I shall not hesitate
to speak of one of his achievements which I recently
looked upon with wonder. Though the undertaking
is a commonplace, and in our days a very frequent
one, the construction of a</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="5"><p>bath, yet his thoughtfulness and intelligence even in this commonplace
matter is marvellous.
The site was not flat, but quite sloping and steep;
it was extremely low on one side when he took it in
hand, but he made it level, not only constructing a
firm basis for the entire work and laying foundations
to ensure the safety of the superstructure, but
strengthening the whole with buttresses, very sheer
and, for security’s sake, close together. The building
suits the magnitude of the site, accords well with
the accepted idea of such an establishment, and
shows regard for the principles of lighting.

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="6"><p>
The entrance is high, with a flight of broad
steps of which the tread is greater than the pitch,
to make them easy to ascend. On entering, one
is received into a public hall of good size, with
ample accommodations for servants and attendants.
On the left are the lounging-rooms, also of just
the right sort for a bath, attractive, brightly lighted


<pb n="41"/>

retreats, Then, beside them, a hall, larger than
need be for the purposes of a bath, but necessary
for the reception of the rich. Next, capacious
locker-rooms to undress in, on each side, with a very
high and brilliantly lighted hall between them, in
which are three swimming-pools of cold water; it
is finished in Laconian marble, and has two statues
of white marble in the ancient technique, one of
Hygieia, the other of Aesculapius.

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="7"><p>

On leaving this hall, you come into another
which is slightly warmed instead of meeting you
at once with fierce heat; it is oblong, and has an
apse at each side.<note n="1">Or “long and rounded” ; i.e., elliptical. </note> Next it, on the right, is a
very bright hall, nicely fitted up for massage,
which has on each side an entrance decorated with
Phrygian marble, and receives those who come in
from the exercising-floor. Then near this is another
hall, the most beautiful in the world, in which
one can sit or stand with comfort, linger without
danger and stroll about with profit. It also is
refulgent with Phrygian marble clear to the roof.
Next, comes the hot corridor, faced with Numidian
marble. The hall beyond it is very beautiful, full of
abundant light and aglow with colour like that of
purple hangings.<note n="2">The writer does not mean that the room was hung with
purple, but that the stone with which it was decorated was
purple: perhaps only that it had columns of porphyry.</note> It contains three hot tubs.

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="8"><p>
When you have bathed, you need not go back
through the same rooms, but can go directly to the
cold room through a slightly warmed apartment.
Everywhere there is copious illumination and full
indoor daylight. Furthermore, the height of each



<pb n="43"/>

room is just, and the breadth proportionate to
the length ; and everywhere great beauty and loveliness prevail, for in the words of noble Pindar,<note n="1">Olymp. 6, 3. Pindar’s ἀρχομένου (the beginning of your
work) is out of place in this context.</note>
“Your work should have a glorious countenance.”
This is probably due in the main to the light,
‘the brightness and the windows. Hippias, being
truly wise, built the room for cold baths to northward, though it does not lack a southern exposure ;
whereas he faced south, east, and west the rooms
that require abundant heat.

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="9"><p>

Why should I go on
and tell you of the exercising-floors and of the cloakrooms, which have quick and direct communication
with the hall containing the basin, so as to be convenient and to do away with all risk?
Let no one suppose that I have taken an insignificant achievement as my theme, and purpose to ennoble it by my eloquence. It requires more than a
little wisdom, in my opinion, to invent new manifestations of beauty in commonplace things, as did
our marvellous Hippias in producing this work. It
has all the good points of a bath—usefulness, convenience, light, good proportions, fitness to its site,
and the fact that it can be used without risk. Moreover, it is beautified with all other marks of thoughtfulness—with two toilets, many exits; and two
devices for telling time, a water-clock that bellows
like a bull, and a sundial.
For a man who has seen all this not to render the
work its meed of praise is not only foolish but



<pb n="45"/>

ungrateful, even malignant, it seems to me. I for
my part have done what I could to do justice both
to the work and to the man who planned and
built it. If Heaven ever grants you the privilege
of bathing there, I know that I shall have many
who will join me in my words of praise.

</note></head>
<div type="textpart" subtype=" section" n="1"><p>
When Dionysus led his host against the men of
Ind (surely there is nothing to prevent my telling
you a tale of Bacchus !), he was held at first in such
contempt, they say, by the people there, that they
laughed at his advance ; more than that, they pitied
him for his hardihood, because he was certain to be
trampled under foot in an instant by the elephants
if he deployed against them. No doubt they heard
curious reports about his army from their scouts:
“His rank and file are crack-brained, crazy women,
wreathed with ivy, dressed in fawn-skins, carrying
little headless spears which are of ivy too, and light
targes that boom if you do but touch them”—for
they supposed, no doubt, that the tambours were
shields. ‘A few young clodhoppers are with them,
dancing the can-can without any clothes on; they
have tails, and have horns like those which start
from the foreheads of new-born kids.

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="2"><p>


As for the
general himself, he rides on a car behind a team of
panthers; he is quite beardless, without even the
least bit of down on his cheek, has horns, wears
a garland of grape clusters, ties up his hair with

<pb n="51"/>

a ribbon, and is in a purple gown and gilt slippers.
He has two lieutenants. One<note n="1">Silenus</note>  is a short, thick-set
old man with a big belly, a flat nose and large,
up-standing ears, who is a bit shaky and walks with
a staff (though for the most part he rides on an ass),
and is also in a woman’s gown, which is yellow; he
is a very appropriate aide to such a chief! The
other<note n="2">Pan</note> is a misbegotten fellow like a goat in the
underpinning, with hairy legs, horns, and a long
beard; he is choleric and hot-headed, carries a
shepherd’s pipe in his left hand and brandishes a
crooked stick in his right, and goes bounding all
about the army. The women are afraid of him; they
toss their hair in the wind when he comes near and
cry out ‘Evoe.’ This we suppose to be the name of
their ruler. The flocks have already been harried -
by the women, and the animals torn limb from
limb while still alive; for they are eaters of raw
meat.”

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="3"><p>

On hearing this, the Hindoos and their king
roared with laughter, as well they might, and did
not care to take the field against them or to deploy
their troops ; at most, they said, they would turn their
women loose on them if they came near. They themselves thought it a shame to defeat them and kill
crazy women, a hair-ribboned leader, a drunken little
old man, a goat-soldie? and a lot of naked dancers—
ridiculous, every one of them! But word soon came
that the god was setting the country in a blaze,
burning up cities and their inhabitants and firing the
forests, and that he had speedily filled all India with


<pb n="53"/>

flame. (Naturally, the weapon of Dionysus is fire,
because it.is his father’s and comes from the thunderbolt.<note n="1">Zeus, the father of Dionysys, revealed himself to Semele,
his mother, in all his glory, at her own request. Killed by
his thunderbolt, she gave untimely birth to Dionysus, whom
Zeus stitched into his own thigh and in due time brought
into the world.</note>) Then at last they hurriedly took arms,
saddled and bridled their elephants and put the
towers on them, and sallied out against the enemy.
Even then they despised them, but were angry at
them all the same, and eager to crush the life out of
the beardless general and his army. </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="4"><p>

When the
forces came together and saw one another, the
Hindoos posted their elephants in the van and
moved forward in close array. Dionysus had the
centre in person; Silenus commanded on the right
‘wing and Pan on the left. The Satyrs were commissioned as colonels and captains, and the general
watchword was ‘ Evoe.’ In a trice the tambours were
beat, the cymbals gave the signal for battle, one of
the Satyrs took his horn and sounded the charge,
Silenus’ jackass gave a martial hee-haw, and the
Maenads, serpent-girdled, baring the steel of their
thyrsus-points, fell on with a shriek. The Hindoos
and their elephants gave way at once and fled in
utter disorder, not even daring to get within range.
The outcome was that they were captured by force
of arms and led off prisoners by those whom they
had formerly laughed at, taught by experience that
strange armies should not have been despised on
hearsay.



<pb n="55"/>

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="5"><p>

“But what has your Dionysus to do with
Dionysus?”’ someone may say.<note n="1">οὐδὲν πρὸς τὸν Διόνυσον· ἐπὶ τῶν τὰ μὴ προσήκοντα τοῖς
ὑποκειμένοις λεγόντων. Explained by Zenobius as said in the
theatre, when poets began to write about Ajax and the
Centaurs and other things not in the Dionysiac legend.
See Paroemiographi Graeci i. p. 137.</note> This much: that
in my opinion (and in the name of the Graces don’t
suppose me in a corybantic frenzy or downright drunk
if I compare myself to the gods!) most people are in
the same state of mind as the Hindoos when they
encounter literary novelties, like mine for example.
Thinking that.what they hear from me will smack
of Satyrs and of jokes, in short, of comedy—for that
is the conviction they have formed, holding I know
not what opinion of me—some of them do not come
at all, believing it unseemly to come off their elephants and give their attention to the revels of
women and the skippings of Satyrs, while others
apparently come for something of that kind, and
when they find steel instead of ivy, are even then
slow to applaud, confused by the unexpectedness
of the thing. But I promise confidently that if
they are willing this time as they were before to
look often upon the mystic rites, and if my booncompanions of old remember “the revels we shared
in the days that are gone”<note n="2">The source of the anapaest kéuwv xoway trav réTe Katpav
is unknown.</note> and do not despise my
Satyrs and Sileni, but drink their fill of this bowl,
they too will know the Bacchic frenzy once again,
and will often join me in the “Evoe.”

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="6"><p>

But let them
do as they think fit: a man’s ears are his own!
As we are still in India, I want to tell you another
tale of that country which “has to do with Dionysus,”




<pb n="57"/>

like the first, and is not irrelevant to our business.
Among the Machlaean Indians who feed their flocks
_on the left banks of the Indus river as you look down -
stream, and who reach clear to the Ocean—in their
country there is a grove in an enclosed place of no
great size; it'is completely sheltered, however, for
rank ivy and grapevines overshadow it quite. In it
there are three springs of fair, clear water: one
belongs to the Satyrs, another to Pan, the third to
Silenus. The Indians visit the place once a year,
celebrating the feast of the god, and they drink
from the springs: not, however, from all of them,
indiscriminately, but according to age. The boys
drink from the spring of the Satyrs, the men from
the spring of Pan, and those of my time of life from
the spring of Silenus.
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="7"><p>

What happens to the boys when they drink, and
what the men make bold to do under the influence of
Pan would make a long story; but what the old do
when they get drunk on the water is not irrelevant.
When an old man drinks and falls under the
influence of Silenus, at first he is mute for a long
time and appears drugged and sodden. Then of
a sudden he acquires a splendid voice, a distinct
utterance, a silvery tone, and is as talkative
as he was mute before. Even by gagging him you
couldn’t keep him from talking steadily and delivering long harangues. It is all sensible though, and
well ordered, and in the style of Homer’s famous
orator ;<note n="1">Odysseus: Il. 3, 222, where he and Menelaus are compared.</note> for their words fall “like the snows of
winter.” You can’t compare them to swans on



<pb n="59"/>

account of their age ; but like cicadas, they keep up
a constant roundelay till the afternoon is far spent.
Then, when the fumes of the drink leave them at
last, they fall silent and relapse into their old ways.
But I have not yet told you the strangest part of
it. If an old man is prevented by sunset from
reaching the end of the story which he is telling,
and leaves it unfinished, when he drinks again
another season he takes up what he was saying the
year before when the fumes left him!

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="8"><p>

Permit me this joke at my own expense, in the
spirit of Momus. I refuse to draw the moral, I
swear; for you already see how the fable applies to
me. If I make any slip, then, the fumes are to
blame, but if what I say should seem reasonable,
then Silenus has been good to me.

AN INTRODUCTION,

</p></div></div>

<div type="translation" n="tlg0062.tlg004">
<head>HERACLES: AN INTRODUCTION</head>
<div type="textpart" subtype=" section" n="1"><p>
The Celts call Heracles Ogmios in their native tongue, and they portray the god in a very peculiar way. To their notion, he is extremely old, baldheaded, except for a few lingering hairs which are quite gray, his skin is wrinkled, and he is burned as black as can be, like an old sea-dog. You would think him a Charon. or a sub-Tartarean Iapetus<note n="1">Chief of the Titans, who warred on Zeus and after their defeat were buried for ever in the bowels of the earth, below
Tartarus.</note>—
anything but Heracles! Yet, in spite of his looks,
he has the equipment of Heracles: he is dressed in
the lion’s skin, has the club in his right hand, carries
- the quiver at his side, displays the bent bow in his
left, and is Heracles from head to heel as far as
that goes.

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="2"><p>

I thought, therefore, that the Celts had
committed this offence against the good-looks of
Heracles to spite the Greek gods, and that they were
punishing him by means of the picture for having
once visited their country on a cattle-lifting foray,
at the time when he raided most of the western
nations in his quest-of the herds of Geryon.

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="3"><p>

But
I have not yet mentioned the most surprising thing



<pb n="65"/>

in the picture. That old Heracles of theirs drags
after him a great crowd of men who are all tethered
by the ears! His leashes are delicate chains
fashioned of gold and amber, resembling the
prettiest of necklaces. Yet, though led by bonds so
weak, the men do.not think of escaping, as they
easily could, and they do not pull back at all or brace
their feet and lean in the opposite direction to that
in which he is leading them. In fact, they follow
cheerfully and joyously, applauding their leader and
’ all pressing him close and keeping the leashes slack
in their desire to overtake him; apparently they
would be offended if they were let loose! But let
me tell you without delay what seemed to me the
strangest thing of all. Since the painter had no
place to which he could attach the ends of the
chains, as the god’s right hand already held the
club and his left the bow, he pierced the tip of his
tongue and represented him drawing the men by
that means! Moreover, he has his face turned
toward his captives, and is smiling.

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="4"><p>

I had stood for a long time, looking, wondering,
puzzling and fuming, when a Celt at my elbow, not
unversed in Greek lore, as he showed by his excellent
use of our language, and who had, apparently,
studied local traditions, said: “I will read you the
riddle of the picture, stranger, as you seem to be
very much disturbed about it. We Celts do not agree
with you Greeks in thinking that Hermes is
Eloquence: we identify Heracles with it, because heis far more powerful than Hermes. And don’t be
surprised: that he is represented as an old man, for
eloquence and eloquence alone is wont to show its

full vigour in old age, if your poets are right in
saying

That is why your Nestor’s tongue distils honey,<note n="3">Iliad 1, 249.</note> and
why the Trojan counsellors have a voice like flowers<note n="4">Iliad 3, 152. </note>
(the flowers mentioned are lilies, if my memory
serves).


</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="5"><p>

This being so, if old Heracles here drags
men after him who are tethered by the ears to
his tongue, don’t be surprised at that, either: you
know the kinship between ears and tongue. Nor is
it a slight upon him that his tongue is pierced.
Indeed,” said he, “I call to mind a line or two of
comedy which I learned in your country:
the talkative

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="6"><p>

In general, we consider that the real Heracles
was a wise man who achieved everything by
eloquence and applied persuasion as his principal
force. His arrows represent words, I suppose, keen,
sure and swift, which make their wounds in souls.
In fact, you yourselves admit that words are
winged.” <note n="6">Homer, passim. </note>

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="7"><p>
Thus far the Celt. And when I was debating
with myself on the question of appearing here, considering whether it was proper for a man of my age,
who had long ago given up lecturing in public, once
more to subject himself to the verdict of so large a
jury, it chanced in the nick of time that I
remembered the picture. Until then I had been







<pb n="69"/>

afraid that some of you might think I was doing an
altogether boyish thing and at my age shewing the
rashness of youth ; and that then some young fellow
full of Homer might rebuke me by saying “Your
strength is gone”’ and “Bitter old age has you in his
clutch” and “Your squire is ‘feeble and your steeds
are slow,”<note n="1">Iliad 8, 108 f. (spoken to Nestor).</note> aiming the last quip at my feet. But
when I remember that old Heracles, I am moved to
undertake anything, and am not ashamed to be so
bold, since I am no older than the picture.

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="8"><p>

Goodbye,
then, to strength, speed, beauty and all manner of
physical excellence! Let your god of love, O Tean
poet,
<note n="2">Anacreon (frg. 23 Bergk): the poem is lost.</note>
glance at my grizzled chin and flit by me if he
will on his gold-gleaming pinions: Hippoclides will
not mind!
<note n="3">Hippoclides of Athens, one of many suitors for the hand
of the daughter of Clisthenes, tyrant of Sicyon, was preferred
above them all. But at the feast which was to have announced his engagement he danced so well and so unwisely that Clisthenes was disgusted and said ‘Son of
Tisander, you have danced yourself out of the match!”
“Hippoclides does not mind !” was the answer he received.
“Hence the proverb,” as Herodotus says (6, 126-131).</note>
Now should certainly be the time for
eloquence to flourish and flower and reach its fulness,
to drag as many as it can by the ears and to let fly
many arrows. At least there is no fear that its
quiver will unexpectedly run short!
You see what encouragement I apply to my age
and my infirmities. This it is which gave me the
heart to drag my -pinnace, long ago laid up, to
the water, provision her as best I could and set sail
on the high seas once more. Be it your part,

<head>Amber, or the Swan<note>The introduction to a lecture, evidently familiar toLucian’s public under two names.</note></head>
<div type="textpart" subtype=" section" n="1"><p>
With regard to amber, you doubtless share the
general belief in the story that poplars on the banks
of the river Eridanus shed tears of it in grief over ‘
Phaethon ; and that these poplars are the sisters of
Phaethon, who out of sorrow for the boy were
changed into trees and still drip tears—of amber!
Such tales, when I heard them from the lips of the
poets, made me expect that if ever I got to the
Eridanus, by going underneath one of the poplars
and holding out a fold of my cloak I could supply
myself with amber by catching a few of their tears.

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="2"><p>

As a matter of fact, I did visit those parts not long ago
(on another errand, to be sure) ; and as I had to go up
the Eridanus, I kept a sharp lookout, but neither
poplars nor amber were to be seen. Indeed, the very
name of Phaethon was unknown to the natives. At
any rate, when I went into the matter and inquired
when we should reach the poplars—*the amberpoplars,”—the boatmen laughed and asked me to tell
them more plainly what I meant. So I told them
the story: that Phaethon was the child of the Sun,
and that on coming of age he asked his father to
let him drive the car and “do just one day ” himself ;
his father consented, and he was thrown from the
car and killed. “And his sisters,” said I, “out of


<pb n="77"/>

sorrow turned into poplars somewhere in this neighbourhood of yours, on the banks of the Eridanus, at
the spot where he fell, and still weep for him with .
tears of amber.”

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="3"><p>
“Who told you that?” said they.
“The cheat and liar! We never saw any driver
fall from a car,and we haven't the poplars you speak
of. If we had anything of that sort, do you suppose
that for two obols we would row or tow our boats upstream, when we could get rich by picking up the
tears. of the poplars?”’ This remark struck me
uncommonly, and I held my tongue for shame that
I had acted like a child, and no mistake, in believing
the poets, who are such incredible liars that nothing
sensible finds any favour with them.
Well, this was one great expectation that I was
disappointed in; and I was as vexed as if I had let
the amber slip through my fingers, for I was already
imagining all the different uses which I should make
of it.

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="4"><p>

But the other story I thought I should
find completely true there—the one about troops of
swans that sing on the banks of the river. So I put
a second question to the boatmen—for we were still
on our way up. “But, how about your swans?” I
asked. “At what time do they sing so melodiously,
ranged along the river, on this side and on that?
People say, at all events, that they were associates
of Apollo, men with the gift of song, who somewhere
in these parts changed into birds, and for that
reason do not forget their music, but still continue
to sing.”

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="5"><p>
ith a burst of laughter they replied :
"Why, man, aren’t you ever going to stop telling
lies about our country and our river? We are
always on the water, and have worked on the
Eridanus since we were children, almost; now and


<pb n="79"/>

then we see a few swans in the marshes by the
river, and they have a very unmusical and feeble
croak ; crows or daws are Sirens to them. As for
the sweet song you speak of, we never heard it or
even dreamed of it, so we wonder how these stories
about us got to your people.”

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="6"><p>

Many such deceptions can be practised on men
when they put faith in those who exaggerate everything they tell. Therefore I am now afraid on my
own account that you who have just come to town
and are about to hear me for the first time may
expect to find amber and swans here, and after
a while may go away laughing at the men who
promised you that ‘such treasures were abundant in
my discourse. But I swear that neither you nor
anyone else ever heard me make such boasts about
my compositions, and never will! Others, to be
sure, you can find in plenty of the Eridanus kind:
their words distil very gold instead of amber, and
they are far more melodious than the swans of
poetry. But as for my talk, you already see how
simple and matter-of-fact it is, and that there is no -
music to it. So look out that you do not set your
hopes of me too high, and thereby have an experience
like people who see things under water. They expect
them to be as large as they looked through the

<head>THE FLY<note>It need hardly be said that this belongs to the domain of belles lettres, not of science. Like the Italian poets of the Renaissance, the rhetoricians of the decadence delighted to show their cunning by “praising” all manner of things good, bad, and indifferent.</note></head>
<div type="textpart" subtype=" section" n="1"><p>
The fly is not the smallest of winged creatures, at
least in comparison with gnats and midges and things
still tinier. On the contrary, she is as much er
than they as she is smaller than the bee. wy
provided with feathers like the birds,
<note n="1">Lit. “like the rest (of the ὄρνεα),” which is illogical.
Perhaps ἀετοῖς should be written.</note>
so as to have
some for plumage all over her body, and others to fly
with, but like grasshoppers, locusts and bees, she has
membranous wings, as much thinner’ than theirs as
Indian stuffs are more delicate and softer than Greek.
Moreover, they have the colours of a peacock in
them, if you look at her sharply when she spreads
them and flies in the sun.

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="2"><p>

She does not fly like
bats with a steady, oar-like movement of the wings,
or like grasshoppers with a spring, or as wasps do,
with a whizzing rush, but easily directs her course to
any quarter of the air she will. She has also this
characteristic, that her flight is not silent but musical :
the sound is not shrill like that of gnats and midges,
nor deep-toned like that of bees, nor fierce and



<pb n="85"/>

threatening like that of wasps; it is much more
melodious, just as flutes are sweeter than trumpet
and cymbals.

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="3"><p>

As for her body, the head is very
delicately attached to the neck and so is easily
moved, not fixed like the head of a grasshopper.
The eyes are prominent, and have much the quality
of horn, The breast is solid, and the legs grow
right out of the waist, which is not at all pinched*
up, as in wasps. As in them, the abdomen is
armoured and resembles a corselet in having flat
zones and scales. She differs, however, from the
wasp and the bee, in that her weapon is not the
hinder-part, but the mouth, or rather the proboscis ;
for, like the elephant, she has a trunk with which
she forages, seizing things and holding them tenaciously, since it is like a tentacle at the end. A
tooth protrudes from it with which the fly inflicts
bites in order to drink the blood, for although she
drinks milk, she likes blood also. The bite causes no
great pain. Though she has six feet, she walks with
only four and uses the two in fwont for all the
purposes of hands. You can see her standing on
four legs, holding up something to eat in her hands
just as we human beings do.

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="4"><p>
The fly is not born in the form which I have described, but as a maggot from the dead bodies of men
or animals. Then, little by little, she puts out
legs, grows her wings, changes from a creeping
to a flying thing, is impregnated and becomes mother
to a little maggot which is to-morrow’s fly. Living


<pb n="87"/>

in the society of man, on the same. food and at the
same table, she eats everything except oil: to taste
this is death to her. Being the creature of a day—
for life is meted out to her in very scant measure—
she likes sunshine best and goes about her affairs in
it. At night she keeps quiet and does not fly or
sing, but hides away and is still.

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="5"><p>
I can also mention
her great intelligence in escaping her designing foe,
the spider. She watches for him lurking in ambush,
and is wary of him, turning aside from his attack,
so as not to be captured by being ensnared and
falling into the toils of the creature. Of her courage
and bravery it is not for me to speak, but for Homer,
the most mighty-mouthed of the poets ; for when he ,
seeks to praise the foremost of the heroes,
<note n="1">(Iliad 17, 570, Menelaus), into whose heart Athena
"puts the boldness of the fly.”</note>
he does -
not compare his bravery to a lion’s or a leopard’s or
a wild boar’s, but to the fearlessness of the fly and
the daring and insistency of her attack. He does
not say that she is reckless, but fearless :
<note n="2">The distinction (unknown to Homer) is between thrasos
and tharsos.</note>
that even
if she is kept away she does not desist but is eager
to bite. So outspoken is he in his praise and fondness for the fly that he mentions her net merely
once or twice but often; in consequence, references
to her enhance the beauty of his poems. Now he
describes her swarming flight after milk ;<note>
<cit><quote><l>the many hordes of clustering flies</l>
<l>That dart about the sheepfolds in the spring,</l>
<l>When pails are wet with milk.</l>
</quote>

<cit><quote><l>They swarmed about the body like the flies</l>
<l>That in the fold buzz round the milky pails.</l>
</quote>
<bibl>Iliad 16, 641</bibl></cit></note> now, when




<pb n="89"/>

Athena turns the arrow aside from Menelaus in order
that it may not strike a vital spot, he likens her to a
mother tending a sleeping child, and again introduces
the fly into the comparison.<note n="1">Iliad 4, 130.</note>
Moreover, he has adorned
them with fine epithets in calling them “clustering”
and their swarms “hordes.”

<note n="2">Iliad 2, 469.</note>

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="6"><p>
So strong is the fly that when she bites she
wounds the skin of the ox and the horse as well as
that of man. She even torments the elephant by
entering his wrinkles and lancing him with her
proboscis as far as its length allows. In mating,
love, and marriage they are very free and easy.
The male is not on and off again in a moment,
like the cock; he covers the female a long time.
She carries her spouse, and they take wing together,
mating uninterruptedly in the air, as everyone
knows. A fly with her head cut off keeps alive a
long time with the rest of her body, and still retains
the breath of life.

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="7"><p>
You may be sure I propose to mention the most
important point in the nature of the fly. It is, I
think, the only point that Plato overlooks in his
discussion of the soul and its immortality. When
ashes are sprinkled on a dead fly, she revives and
has a second birth and a new life from the beginning. This should absolutely convince everyone
that the fly’s soul is immortal like ours, since after
leaving the body it comes back again, recognises
and reanimates it, and makes the fly take wing. It
also confirms the story that the soul of Hermotimus
of Clazomenae would often leave him and go away



<pb n="91"/>

by itself, and then, returning, would occupy his
body again and restore him to life.

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="8"><p>

Knowing not labour and living at large, the. fly
enjoys the fruits of the toil of others, and finds a
bounteous table set everywhere. Goats give milk
for her, bees work for flies and for men quite as
much as for themselves, and cooks sweeten food for
her. She takes precedence even of kings in eating,
and walks about on their tables sharing their feasts
and all their enjoyment.

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="9"><p>

She does not make a nest
or habitation in any one place, but taking up a
roving, Scythian life on the wing, finds bed and
board wherever night chances to overtake her. But
in the dark, as I have said, she does nothing: she
has no desire for stealthy actions and no thought
of disgraceful deeds which would discredit her if
they were done by daylight.
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="10"><p>
The story goes that long ago there was a human
being called Muia, a girl who was very pretty, but
talkative, noisy, and fond of singing. She became a
‘rival of Selene by falling in love with Endymion, and
as she was for ever waking the boy out of his sleep
by chattering and singing and paying him visits, he
became vexed at her, and Selene in anger turned
her into the fly we know.
<note n="1">The story explains the word μυῖα, “fly,” as having been
originally the name of a girl.</note>
So, in remembrance of
Endymion, she begrudges all sleepers their repose,
especially those of tender years; and even her
biting and bloodthirstiness is not a sign of savagery,
but of love and friendship. She gets what


<pb n="93"/>

satisfaction she can, and culls something of the bloom of
beauty.

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="11"><p>

According to the ancients she has had two
namesakes, a very pretty and accomplished poetess
and a famous Athenian courtesan. It was the
latter whom the comic poet meant when he said,
“Yon fly him to the heart did bite.”<note n="1">Unknown (Kock, adesp. 475).</note> From this
you see that comic wit has not disdained the name
of fly nor barred it from the boards, and that parents
have not been ashamed to give it to their daughters.
As for tragedy, it, too, mentions the fly with great
praise; for example, in these words:
<cit><quote>
<l>'Tis strange that while the fly with hardy
strength</l>
<l>Encounters man to sate itself with gore,</l>
<l>Stout men-at-arms should fear the foeman’s
lance!</l></quote>

<bibl>unknown (Nauck, Tag. Graec. Fragm., adesp.</bibl></cit>
I could also say a great deal about Muia, the Pytha
gorean, if her story were not known to everyone.
<note n="3">Very little of her story is known to us. She is said to
have been daughter of Pythagoras and wife of Milo, the
athlete of Croton.</note>

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="12"><p>

There are very large flies, too, which most
people call camp-flies, though some call them
dog-flies. They have a very harsh buzz and.a
very rapid flight. They are extremely long-lived,
and endure the whole winter without food, usually
hiding in the roof. Another surprising thing in





<pb n="95"/>

them is that they are bisexual, like the child of
Hermes and Aphrodite, who had two natures and
double beauty.
Though I still have a great deal to say, I will stop
talking, for fear you may think that, as the saying
goes, I am making an elephant out of a fly.

For he went on to praise philosophy
and the freedom that it gives, and to ridicule the
things that are popularly considered blessings—
wealth and reputation, dominion and honour, yes

by most men, and till then by me also. I took it all
in with eager, wide-open soul, and at the moment I
couldn’t imagine what had come over me ; I was all
confused. Then I felt hurt because he had criticised
what was dearest to me—wealth and money and
reputation,—and I all but cried over their downfall ;

suppose I have had the same sort of experience with
philosophy that the Hindoos are said to have had
with wine when they first tasted it. As they are
by nature more hot-blooded than we, on taking such
strong drink they became uproarious at once, and
were crazed by the unwatered beverage twice as

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="7"><p>

I am in the same case with lovers.
In the absence of the objects of their fancy they
think over their actions and their words, and by
dallying with these beguile their lovesickness into
the belief that they have their sweethearts near; in
fact, sometimes they even imagine they are chatting
with them and are as pleased with what they
formerly heard as if it were just being said, and by
applying their minds to the memory of the past give
themselves no time to be annoyed ‘by the present.
So I, too, in the absence of my mistress Philosophy,
get no little comfort out of gathering together the
words that I then heard and turning them over to
myself. In short, I fix my gaze on that man as if he
were a lighthouse and I were adrift at sea in the
dead of night, fancying him by me whenever I do
anything and always hearing him repeat his former
words. Sometimes, especially when I put pressure
on my soul, his face appears to me and the sound of
his voice abides in my ears. Truly, as the comedian

they speak in a voice that is small, thin, womanish,

stage and tragedy to me?



<pb n="113"/>
</p>

<p><label>B</label> Why, yes! I will stop, certainly, and will now
turn to my subject. The talk began with praise of
Greece and of the men of Athens, because Philosophy
and Poverty have ever been their fuster-brothers,
and they do not look with pleasure on any man, be
he citizen or stranger, who strives to introduce
luxury among them, but if ever anyone comes to
them in that frame of mind, they gradually correct
him and lend a hand in his schooling and convert
him to the simple life.

For example, he mentioned a millionaire who
came to Athens, a very conspicuous and vulgar
person with his crowd of attendants and his gay
clothes and jewelry, and expected to be envied by
all the Athenians and to be looked up to as a happy
man. But they thought the creature unfortunate,
and undertook to educate him, not in a harsh way,
however, nor yet by directly forbidding him to live
as he would in a free city. But when he made himself a nuisance at the athletic clubs and the baths by
jostling and crowding passers with his retinue,
someone or other would say in a low tone, pretending
to be covert, as if he were not directing the remark
at the man himself: “He is afraid of being
murdered in his tub! Why, profound peace reigns
in the baths; there is no need of an army, then!”
And the man, who never failed to hear, got a bit of
instruction in passing. His gay clothes and his
purple gown they stripped from him very neatly by
making fun of his flowery colours, saying, “Spring
already?” ‘How did that peacock get here f”
“Perhaps it’s his mother’s” and the like. His other
vulgarities they turned into jest in the same way—


<pb n="115"/>

the number of his rings, the over-niceness of his
hair, the extravagance of his life. So he was
disciplined little by little, and went away much
improved by the public education he had received.

To show that they are not ashamed to confess
poverty, he mentioned to me a remark which he
said he had heard everybody make with one accord
at the Panathenaic games. One of the citizens had
been arrested and brought before the director of the
games because he was looking on in a coloured cloak.
Those who saw it were sorry for him and tried to
beg him off, and when the herald proclaimed that
he had broken the law by wearing such clothing at
the games, they all cried out in one voice, as if by
pre-arrangement, to excuse him for being in that
dress, because, they said, he had no other.
Well, he praised all this, and also the freedom
there and the blamelessness of their mode of living,
their quiet and leisure; and these advantages they
certainly have in plenty. He declared, for instance,
that a life like theirs is in harmony with philosophy -
and can keep the character pure ; so that a serious
man who has been taught to despise wealth and
elects to live for what is intrinsically good will find
Athens éxactly suited to him.

and they can admit
pleasure by every gate—by the eyes, by the ears
and nostrils, by the throat and reins, Its everflowing, turbid stream widens every street; it
brings in adultery, avarice, perjury and the whole
family of the vices, and sweeps the flooded soul bare
of self-respect, virtue, and righteousness; and then the
ground which they have left a desert, ever parched
with thirst, puts forth a rank, wild growth of lusts.”
That was the character of the city, he declared,
and those all the good things it taught.

“For
my part,” said he, “when I first came back from
Greece, on getting into the neighbourhood of Rome
I stopped and asked myself why I had come here,
repeating the well-known words of Homer:
<note n="2">Odyss. 11, 93.</note>
‘Why
left you, luckless man, the light of day’—Greece,
to wit, and all that happiness and freedom— and
came to see’ the hurly-burly here—informers,
haughty greetings, dinners, flatterers, murders,
legacy-hunting, feigned friendships? And what in
the world do you intend to do, since you can neither
go away nor do as the Romans do?”

“After communing with myself in this vein and
pulling myself out of bowshot as Zeus did Hector
in Homer,

<cit>
<quote>
<l>From out the slaughter, blood, and battle-din,</l>
</quote>
<bibl>Iliad 11, 163.</bibl>
</cit>
I decided to be a stay-at-home in future. Choosing
thereby a sort of life which seems to most people
womanish and spiritless, I converse with Plato,
Philosophy and Truth, and seating myself, as it
were, high up in a theatre full of untold thousands,
I look down on what takes place, which is of a
quality sometimes to afford amusement and laughter,
sometimes to prove a man’s true steadfastness.

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="18"><p>

“Indeed (if it is right to speak in praise of what is
bad), don’t suppose that there is any better school for
virtue or any truer test of the soul than this city and
the life here; it is no small matter to make a stand
against so many desires, so many sights and sounds
that lay rival hands on a man and pull him in every
direction. One must simply imitate Odysseus and
sail past them; not, however, with his hands bound
(for that would be cowardly) nor with his ears
stopped with wax, but with ears open and body
free, and in a spirit of genuine contempt.

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="19"><p>

Furthermore, one has cause to admire philosophy when he
beholds so much folly, and to despise the gifts of
fortune when he sees on the stage of life a play of
many réles, in which one man enters first as servant,
then as master; another first as rich, then as poor;
another now as beggar, now as nabob or king;
another as So-and-so’s friend, another as his enemy ;
another as an exile. And the strangest part of it all
is that although Fortune attests that she makes light



<pb n="121"/>

of human affairs and admits that there is no stability
in them, and in spite of the fact that men see this
demonstrated every day, they still yearn for wealth
and power, and go about every one of them full of
unrealised hopes.
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="20"><p>

“But I have said that there is food for laughter
and amusement in what goes on; let me now explain
it. To begin with, are not the rich ridiculous? They
display their purple gowns and show their rings and
betray an unbounded lack of taste. Would you
believe it ?>—they make use of another man’s
<note n="1">The nomenclator : his proper office was merely to present
the guests to his master, but in reality he often received
them in his master’s stead.</note>
voice
in greeting people they meet, expecting them to be
thankful for a glance and nothing more, while some,
lordlier than the rest, even require obeisance to be
made to them: not at long range, though, or in the
Persian style. No, you must go up, bow your head,
humbling your soul and showing its feelings by
carrying yourself to match them, and kiss the man’s
breast or his hand, while those who are denied even
this privilege envy and admire you! And the man
stands for hours and lets himself be duped! At any
rate there is one point in their inhumanity that I
commend them for—they forbid us their lips!

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="21"><p>

“Far more ridiculous, however, than the rich are
those who visit them and pay them court. They get
up at midnight, run all about the city, let servants
bolt the doors in their faces and suffer themselves
to be called dogs, toadies and similar names. By
way of reward for this galling round of visits they
get the much-talked-of dinner, a vulgar thing, the
source of many evils. How much they eat there,


<pb n="123"/>

how much they drink that they do not want, and
how much they say that should not have been said!
At last they go away either finding fault or nursing
a grievance, either abusing the dinner or accusing
‘the host of insolence and neglectfulness. They fill
the side-streets, puking and fighting at the doors of
brothels, and most of them go to bed by daylight
and give the doctors a reason for making their
rounds. Not all, though ; for some—would you
believe it ?—haven’t even time to be ill!

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="22"><p>

“For my part I hold that the toadies are far
worse than the men they toady to, and that they
alone are to blame for the arrogance of the others.
When they admire their possessions, praise their
plate, crowd their doorways in the early morning
and go up and speak to them as a slave speaks to his
master, how can you expect the rich to feel? If by
common consent they refrained but a short time from
this voluntary servitude, don’t you think that the
tables would be turned, and that the rich would
come to the doors of the poor and beg them not to
leave their happiness unobserved and unattested and
their beautiful tables and great houses unenjoyed
and unused? It is not so much being rich that they
like as being congratulated on it. The fact is, of
course, that the man who lives in a fine house gets
no good of it, nor of his ivory and gold either, unless
someone admires it all. What men ought to do,
then, is to reduce and cheapen the rank of the rich
in this way, erecting in the face of their wealth a


<pb n="125"/>

breastwork of contempt. But as things are, they
turn their heads with servility.

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="23"><p>

“That common men who unreservedly admit
their want of culture should do such things might
fairly be thought reasonable; but that many selfstyled philosophers should act still more ridiculously
than they—this is the surprising thing! How do
you suppose I feel in spirit when I see one of them,
especially if he be well on in years, among a crowd
of toadies, at the heels of some Jack-in-office, in conference with the dispensers of his dinner-invitations ?
His dress only marks him out among the rest and
makes him more conspicuous. What irritates me
most is that they do not change their costume:
certainly they are consistent play-actors in everything else. Take their conduct at dinners—to
what ethical ideal are we to ascribe it?

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="24"><p>

Do they
not stuff themselves more vulgarly, get drunk more
conspicuously, leave the table last of all, and expect
to carry away more delicacies than anyone else?
Some, more subtle than the rest, have often gone so
far as to sing.”
All this, he thought, was ridiculous: and he made
special mention of people who cultivate philosophy
for hire and put virtue on sale over a counter, as it
were : indeed, he called the lecture-rooms of these
men factories and bazaars. For he maintained that
one who intends to teach contempt for wealth
should first of all show that he is himself above
gain.
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="25"><p>

Certainly he used to put these principles into
practice consistently, not only giving instruction
without recompense to all who desired it, but
helping the needy and holding all manner of super-
"125
<pb n="127"/>

fluity in contempt. So far was he from coveting the
property of others that even when his own property
was going to rack and ruin he did not concern
himself about it. Although he had a farm not far
from the city, he’ did not care to set foot on it for
many years. More than this, he used to say that it
was not his at all. His idea was, I take it, that we
are not “owners” of any of these things by natural
law, but that we take over the use of them for
an indefinite period by custom and inheritance, and
are considered their proprietors for a brief space ;
and when our allotted days of grace are past
another takes them over and enjoys the title.
He likewise sets no mean example for those who
care to imitate him in his simple diet, his moderate
physical exercises, his earnest face, his plain clothes
and above all, his well-balanced understanding and
his kindly ways.

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="26"><p>

He always advised his disciples
not to postpone being good, as most people do, by
setting themselves a limit in the form of a holiday or
a festival, with the intention of beginning from that
date to shun lies and do as they should; for he
deemed that an inclination towards the higher life
brooked no delay. He made no secret of his
condemnation of the sort of philosophers who think it
a course in virtue if. they train the young to enduré
“full many pains and toils,"

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="27"><p>
It was his



<pb n="129"/>

opinion that this hardness and insensibility should
be created rather in the souls of men, and that
he who elects to give the best possible education
ought to have an eye to soul, to body, and to age
and previous training, that he may not subject
himself to criticism on the score of setting his pupils
tasks beyond their strength. Indeed, he asserted
that many die as a result of strains so unreasonable.
I myself saw one student who, after a taste of the
tribulations in that camp, had made off without a
backward glance as soon as he heard true doctrine,
and had come to Nigrinus: he was clearly the
better for it.

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="28"><p>
At length leaving the philosophers, he recurred to
the rest of mankind, and told about the uproar of
the city, the crowding, the theatres, the races, the
statues. of the drivers, the names of the horses, and
the conversations in the streets about these matters.
The craze for horses is really great, you know, and
men with a name for earnestness have caught it in
great numbers.

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="29"><p>
Next he touched upon another human comedy,
played by the people who occupy themselves with
life beyond the grave and with last wills, adding
that sons of Rome speak the truth only once in their
whole lives (meaning in their wills), in order that
they may not reap the fruits of their truthfulness !
<note n="1">A famous instance is the case of Petronius, who expressed
his opinion of Nero in his will and made the emperor his
executor.</note>
I could not help interrupting him with laughter
when he said that they want to have their follies
buried with them and to leave their stupidity on
record, inasmuch as some of them leave instructions



<pb n="131"/>

that clothing be burned with them which they prized
in life, others that servants stay by their tombs,
and here and there another that his gravestone be
wreathed with flowers.

They remain foolish even
on their deathbeds.

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="30"><p>

He thought he could guess
what they had done in life when they issued such
injunctions touching the hereafter: “It is they,”
said he, “who buy expensive dainties and let wine
flow freely at dinners in an atmosphere of saffron
and perfumes, who glut themselves with roses in
midwinter, loving their rarity and unseasonableness
and despising what is seasonable and natural because
of its cheapness’; it is they who drink myrrh.” And
that was the point in which he criticised them
especially, that they do not even know how to give
play to their desires, but transgress in them and
obliterate the boundary-lines, on all sides surrendering their souls to luxury to be trodden under foot,
and as they say in tragedy and comedy, “forcing an
entrance alongside the door."
<note n="1">The phrase does not occur in any of the extant plays.
As Greek houses were generally of sun-dried brick, it was
not difficult to dig through the wall, but only an inveterate
‘wall-digger’ (housebreaker) would choose that method of
entry when the door was unlocked.</note>
These he called
unidiomatic pleasures.

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="31"><p>

From the same standpoint he made a comment
exactly like that of Momus. Just as the latter found
fault with the god
<note n="2">Poseidon: see Hermotimus, 20.</note>
who made the bull for not
putting the horns in front of the eyes, so he censured
those who wear garlands for not knowing where
they should go. “If it is the scent of their violets




<pb n="133"/>

and roses that they like,” he said, “they certainly
ought to put their garlands under their noses, as
close as may be to the intake of the breath, so as to
inhale the greatest possible amount of pleasure.”

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="32"><p>

Another thing, he ridiculed the men who
devote such a surprising degree of energy to dinners
in the effort to secure variety in flavours and new
effects in pastry. He said that these underwent a
great deal of inconvenience through their devotion
to a brief and temporary pleasure. Indeed, he
pointed out that all their trouble was taken for
the sake of four finger-breadths, the extent of the’
longest human throat. “Before eating,” said he,
“they get no good out of what they have bought,
_\and after eating, the sense of fulness is no more
agreeable because it derives from expensive food ; it
follows, then, that it is the pleasure of swallowing
which has cost them so dear.” And he said that it
served them right for being uneducated and consequently unfamiliar with the truer pleasures, which
are all dispensed by philosophy to those who elect
a life of toil.

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="33"><p>

He had much to say about their behaviour
in the baths—the number of their attendants, their
offensive actions, and the fact that some of them are
carried by servants almost as if they were corpses on
their way to the graveyard. There is one practice,
however, which he appeared to detest above all
others, a wide-spread custom in the city and in the
baths. It is the duty of certain servants, going in
advance of their masters, to cry out and warn them
to mind their footing when they are about to pass
something high or low, thus reminding them, oddly
enough, that they are walking! He was indignant,


<pb n="135"/>

you see, that although they do not need the mouths
or the hands of others in eating or the ears of others
in hearing, they need the eyes of others to see their
way in spite of the soundness of their own, and
suffer themselves to be given directions fit only for
unfortunates and blind men. - “Why,” said- he,
“this is actually done in public squares at midday,
even to governors of cities!”
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="34"><p>
When he had said this and much more of the ©
same sort, he ended his talk. Until then I had
listened to him in awe, fearing that he would cease.
When he stopped, I felt like the Phaeacians of old,<note>Odyss. 11, 333.</note>
for I stared at him a long time spellbound. Afterwards, in a great fit of confusion and giddiness, I
dripped with sweat, I stumbled and stuck in the
endeavour to speak, my voice failed, my tongue
faltered, and finally I began to cry in embarrassment; for the effect he produced: in me was not
superficial or casual. My wound was deep and vital,
and his words, shot with great accuracy, clove, if I
may say so, my very soul in twain.

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="35"><p>

For if I too
may now adopt the language of a philosopher,
my conception of the matter is that the soul of a
well-endowed man resembles a very tender target.
Many bowmen, their quivers full of words of all
sorts and kinds, shoot at it during life, but not with
success in every case. Some draw to the head and
let fly harder than they should: though they hit the
target, their arrows do not stick in it, but owing to



<pb n="137"/>

their momentum go through and continue their
flight, leaving only a gaping wound in the soul..
Others, again, do the opposite ; themselves too weak,
their bows too slack, the arrows do not even carry
to the target as a rule, but often fall spent at half
the distance ; and if ever they do carry, they strike
“with a mere fret o’ the skin,”
<note n="1">Iliad 17, 599.</note>
and do not make a
deep wound, as they were not sped with a strong
pull.

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="36"><p>

But a good bowman like Nigrinus first of
all scans the target closely for fear that it may be
either very soft or too hard for his arrow—for of
course there are impenetrable targets. When he is
clear on this point, he dips his arrow, not in venom
like those of the Scythians nor in vegetable poison
like those of the Curetes, but in a sweet, gentlyworking drug, and then shoots with skill. The arrow,
driven by just the right amount of force, penetrates
‘to ghe point of passing through, and then sticks fast
and gives off a quantity of the drug, which naturally
spreads and completely pervades the soul. That is
why people laugh and cry as they listen, as I did—
of course the drug was quietly circulating in my soul.
I could not help quoting him the well-known line:
“Shoot thus, and bring, mayhap, a ray of hope!” <note> Iliad 8, 282.</note>

Not everyone who hears the Phrygian flute goes
frantic, but only those who are possessed of ‘Rhea
and are put in mind of their condition by the music.
In, like manner, naturally, not all who listen to
philosophers go away enraptured and wounded, but
only those who previously had in their nature some
secret bond of kinship with philosophy.

It was on the cards, it seems, that our modern
world should not be altogether destitute of noteworthy and memorable’ men, but should produce
enormous physical prowess and a highly philosophic
mind. I speak with reference to the Boeotian
Sostratus, whom the Greeks called Heracles and
believed to be that hero, and especially to Demonax,
the philosopher. Both these men I saw myself, and
saw with wonderment: and under one of them,
Demonax, I was long a student. I have written
about ‘Sostratus elsewhere,
<note n="1">The treatise is lost.</note>
and have described his
size and excessive strength, his open-air life on
Parnassus, his bed that was no bed of ease, his
mountain fare and his deeds (not inconsistent with
his name<note n="2">The nickname Heracles.</note>) achieved in the way of slaying robbers,
making roads in‘untravelled country and bridging
places hard to pass.

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="2"><p>

It is now fitting to tell of
Demonax for two reasons—that he may be retained
in memory by men of culture as far as I can bring it
about, and that young men of good instincts who
aspire to philosophy may not have to shape themselves by ancient precedents alone, but may be able
to set themselves a pattern from our modern world
and to copy that man, the best of all the philosophers
whom I know about.





<pb n="145"/>
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="3"><p>
He was a Cypriote by birth, and not of common
stock as regards civic-rank and property. Nevertheless, rising above all this and thinking that he
deserved the best that life offers, he aspired to
philosophy. It was not at the instigation of
Agathobulus or his predecessor Demetrius or
Epictetus, though he studied with all these men and
with Timocrates of Heraclia besides, a wise man of
great sublimity in thought as well as in language.
As I was saying, however, Demonax was not
enlisted in the cause by any of these men, but even
from his boyltood felt the stirring of an individual
impulse toward the higher life and an inborn love for
philosophy, so that he despised all that men count
good, and, committing himself unreservedly to
liberty and free-speech, was steadfast in leading a
Straight, sane, irreproachable life and in setting an
example to all who saw and heard him by his good
judgment and the honesty of his philosophy.

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="4"><p>

You must not conceive, however, that he rushed
into these matters with unwashen feet, as the saying
goes: he was brought up on the poets and knew
most of them by heart, he was a practised speaker,
his acquaintance with the schools of philosophy was
not secured either in a short time or (to quote the
proverb) “with the tip of his finger,” he had trained
his body and hardened it for endurance and in
general he had made it his aim to require nothing
from anyone else. Consequently, when he found out
that he was no longer sufficient unto himself, he volun-
tarily took his departure from life, leaving behind
him a great reputation among Greeks of culture.

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="5"><p>
He did not mark out for himself a single form
of philosophy but combined many of them, and never
145
VOL. f. L
<pb n="147"/>

would quite reveal which one he favoured. Probably
he had most in common with Socrates, although he
seemed to follow the man of Sinope<note n="1">Diogenes.</note>
in dress and in
easy-going ways. He did not, however, alter the
details of his life in order to excite the wonder
and attract the gaze of men he met, but led the
same life as everyone else, was simple and not in the
least subject to pride, and played his part in society
and politics.

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="6"><p>
He did not cultivate the irony of
Socrates ; his conversations were full of Attic charm,
so that his visitors, on going away, did not feel
contempt for him because he was ill-bred or aversion
to his criticisms because they were gloomy, but
were beside themselves for joy and were far better,
happier and more hopeful of the future than when
they came.

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="7"><p>

He never was known to make an
uproar or excite himself or get angry, even if he had
to rebuke someone; though he assailed sins, he
forgave sinners, thinking that one should pattern
after doctors, who heal sicknesses but feel no anger
at the sick. He considered that it is human to err,
divine or all but divine to set right what has gone
amiss.

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="8"><p>
Leading such“a life, he wanted nothing for
himself, but helped his friends in a reasonable way.
Some of them, who were seemingly favoured by
fortune, he reminded that they were elated over
imaginary blessings of brief span. Others, who were
bewailing poverty, fretting at exile or finding fault
with old age or sickness, he laughingly consoled,
saying that they failed to see that after a little they
would have surcease of worries and would all soon find



<pb n="149"/>

oblivion of their fortunes, good and bad, and lasting
liberty.

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="9"><p>

He made it his business also to reconcile
brothers at variance and to miake terms of peace
between wives and husbands. On occasion, he has
talked reason to excited mobs, and has usually persuaded them to serve their country in a temperate
spirit.

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="10"><p>

Such was the character of his philosophy—kind,
gentle and cheerful. The only thing which distressed him was the illness or death of a friend,
for he considered friendship the greatest of human
blessings. For this reason he was everyone’s friend,
and there was no human being whom he did not
include in his affections, though he liked the society
of some better than that of others. He held aloof
only from those who seemed to him to be involved
in sin beyond hope of cure. And in all this, his
every word and deed was smiled on by the Graces
and by Aphrodite, even; so that, to quote the
comedian, “persuasion perched upon his lips.”

Hence all Athens, high and low, admired him
enormously and always viewed him as a superior
being. Yet in office he ran counter to public opinion
and won from the masses quite as much hatred as
his prototype<note n="2">Socrates.</note>
by his freedom of speech and action.
He too had his Anytus and his Meletus who combined
against him and brought the same charges that their
predecessors brought against Socrates, asserting that
he had never been known to sacrifice and was the
only man in the community uninitiated in the Eleusinian mysteries. In reply to this, with right good




<pb n="151"/>

courage he wreathed his head, put on a clean cloak,
went to the assembly and made his defence, which
was in part good-tempered, in part more caustic than
accorded with his scheme of life. Regarding his
never having offered sacrifice to Athena, he said:
“Do not be surprised, men of Athens, that I have not
hitherto sacrificed to her: I did not suppose that she
had any need of my offerings.’”” Regarding the other
charge, the matter of the mysteries, he said that he
had never joined them in the rite because if the
mysteries were bad, he .would not hold his tongue
before the uninitiate but would turn them away from
the cult, while if they were good, he would reveal
them to everybody out of his love for humanity. So
the Athenians, who already had stones in both hands
to throw at him, became good-natured and friendly
toward him at once, and from that time on they
honoured, respected and finally admired him. Yet
in the very beginning of his speech he had used a
pretty caustic introduction, “Men of Athens, you see
me ready with my garland: come, sacrifice me like
your former victim, for on that occasion your offering
found no favour with the gods!”

I should like to cite a few of his well-directed
and witty remarks, and may as well begin with
Favorinus
<note n="1">An eunuch from Arles, of considerable repute as a
sophist.</note> and what he said to him. When
Favorinus was told by someone that Demonax was
making fun of his lectures and particularly of the
laxity of their rhythm, saying that it was vulgar and
effeminate and not by any means appropriate to
philosophy, he went to Demonax and asked him:
“Who are you to libel my compositions?” “A

man with an ear that is not easy to cheat,” said
he. The sophist kept at him and asked: “What
qualifications had you, Demonax, to leave school
and commence philosophy?” “Those-you lack,” he
retorted.

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="13"><p>

Another time the same man went to him and
asked what philosophical school he favoured most.
Demonax replied: “Why, who told you that I was
a philosopher?” As he left, he broke into a very
hearty laugh ; and when Favorinus asked him what
he was laughing at, he replied: “It seemed to me
ridiculous that you should think a philosopher can
be told by his beard when you yourself have none.”

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="14"><p>
When the Sidonian sophist
<note n="1">Otherwise unknown.</note>
was once showing.
his powers at Athens, and was voicing his own
praise to the effect that he was acquainted with all
philosophy—but I may as well cite his very words :
“If Aristotle calls me to the Lyceum, I shall go
with him; if Plato calls me to the Academy, I shall
come; if Zeno calls, I shall spend my time in the
Stoa ; if Pythagoras calls, I shall hold my tongue.”
<note n="2">Alluding to the Pythagorean vow of silence.</note>
Well, Demonax arose in the midst of the audience
and said: “Ho” (addressing him by name), “Pythagoras is calling you !”
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="15"><p>
When a handsome young fellow named Pytho,
who belonged to one of the aristocratic families
in Macedonia, was quizzing him, putting a catchquestion to him and asking him to tell the logical
answer, he said: “I know thus much, my boy—
it’s a poser, and so are you!” Enraged at the
pun, the other said threateningly: “I'll show you
in short order that you’ve a man to deal with!”

whereupon Demonax laughingly inquired: “Oh,
you will send for your man, then ?”

When an athlete, whom he had ridiculed for letting himself be seen in gay clothes although he was
an Olympic champion, struck him on the head with
a stone and drew blood, each of the bystanders was
as angry as if he himself had been struck, and they
shouted “Go to the proconsul!” But Demonax
said “No! not to the proconsul—for the doctor !”

Finding a bit of jewelry one day while he was out
walking, he posted a notice in the public square
asking the one who owned it and had lost it to
come and get it by describing the weight of the
setting, the stone, and the engravings on it. Well, a
pretty girl came to him saying that she had lost it;
but as there was nothing right in her description,
Demonax said: “Be off, girl, and don’t lose your
own jewel : this is none of yours !”

A Roman senator in Athens introduced his son

The Cynic who pursued his philosophical studies
clad in a bearskin he would not call Honoratus,
which was his name, but Ursinus.
When a man asked him what he thought was
the definition of happiness, he replied that none but
a free man is happy; and when the other said that
free men were numerous, he rejoined:


</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="20"><p>
“But I have

in mind the man who neither hopes nor fears anything.” But how can one achieve this? For the

«Why, if you observe human affairs you will find that
they do not afford justification either for hope or for
fear, since, whatever you may say, pains and pleasures
are alike destined to end.”

When Peregrinus Proteus rebuked him for laughing a great deal and making sport of mankind
saying: “Demonax, you're not at all doggish!” he
answered, “Peregrinus, you are not at all human!”
<note n="1">Peregrinus Proteus, of whose death and translation to a

When a scientist was talking of the Topsy-turvy

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="23"><p>
When a fellow claimed to be a sorcerer and to
have spells so potent that by their agency he could
prevail on everybody to give him whatever he
wanted, Demonax said: “Nothing strange in that!
I am in the same business: follow me to the breadwoman’s, if you like, and you shall see me persuade
her to give me bread with a single spell and a tiny
charm ”’—implying that a coin is as good as a spell.
When Herodes,<note n="2">Herodes Atticus. “Bolydeuces was a favourite slave.</note>

the premature death of Polydeuces and wanted a
chariot regularly made ready and horses put to it
just. as if the boy were going for a drive, and dinner
regularly served for him, Demonax went to him and
said: “Iam bringing you a message from Polydeuces.”




<pb n="159"/>

Herodes was pleased and thought that Demonax, like
everyone else, was falling in with his humour; so he
said: Well, what does Polydeuces want, Demonax?”
“He finds fault with you,” said he, “for not going
to join him at once!’

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="24"><p>

He went to a man who was mourning the death
of a son and had shut himself up in the dark, and
told him that he was a sorcerer and could raise the
boy’s shade for him if only he would name three
men who had never mourned for anyone. When the
man hesitated long arfd was perplexed—I suppose he
could not name a single one—Demonax said: “You
ridiculous fellow, do you think, then, that you alone
suffer beyond endurance, when you see that nobody
is unacquainted with mourning?”

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="25"><p>
He also liked to poke fun at those who use
obsolete and unusual. words in conversation. For
instance, to a man who had been asked a certain

answer me as if I had asked in Agamemnon’s
day.”

On seeing two philosophers very ignorantly debating a given subject, one asking silly questions and

Cethegus the ex-consul, going by way of Greece

Again, on seeing a soothsayer make public forecasts
for money, he said: “1 don’t see on what ground you

When a Roman ofticer, well-developed physically, gave him an exhibition of sword-practice on a

‘Moreover, when questions were unanswerable he

On seeing an aristocrat who set great store on

he was but a sheep for all that!”

A vile poet named Admetus told him that he
had written an epitaph in a single line and had given
instructions in his will to have it carved on his tomb- .
stone. I may as well quote it exactly :
<quote>Earth, in thy bosom receive Admetus’s husk ; he’s a god now!</quote>
Demonax said with a laugh: “The epitaph is so fine
that I wish it were already carved!”

A man saw on the legs of Demonax a
discoloration of the sort that is natural to old

Above all, he made war on those who cultivate
philosophy in the spirit of vainglory and not in the
spirit of truth. For example, on seeing a Cynic with
cloak and wallet, but with a bar (hyperon) for a



<pb n="167"/>

staff, who was making an uproar and saying that: he
was the follower of Antisthenes, Crates, and
Diogenes, Demonax said: “Don’t lie! You are.

just for the sake of the pun, without reference to a definite
person.</note>)!”

When he saw many of the athletes fighting

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="51"><p>
His remark to the proconsul was at once
clever and cutting. This man was one of the sort
that use pitch to remove hair from their legs and
their whole bodies. When a Cynic mounted a stone
and charged him with this, accusing him of
effeminacy, he was angry, had the fellow hauled
down and was on the point of confining him in the
stocks or even sentencing him to exile. But Demonax,
who was passing by, begged him to pardon the man
for making bold to speak his mind in the traditional
Cynic way. The proconsul said: “Well, I will let
him off for you this time, but if he ever dares to do
such a thing again, what shall be done to him?”
"Have him depilated !" said Demonax.
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="52"><p>
One to whom the emperor had entrusted the

When Epictetus rebuked him and advised him to

His reply to Herminus the Aristotelian deserves
mention, Aware that, although he was an out-andout scoundrel and had done a thousand misdeeds,

He lived almost a hundred years, without illness
or pain, bothering nobody and asking nothing of
anyone, helping his friends and never making an
enemy. Not only the Athenians but all Greece
conceived such affection for him that when he passed
by the magistrates rose up in his honour and there
was silence everywhere. Toward the end, when ‘he
was very old, he used to eat and sleep uninvited in
any house which he chanced to be passing, and
the inmates thought that it was almost a divine visitation, and that good fortune had entered their
doors. As he went by, the bread-women would pull
him toward them, each wanting him to take some
bread from her, and she who succeeded in giving it
thought that she was in luck. The children, too,
brought him fruit and called him father. Once when



<pb n="173"/>

there was a party quarrel in Athens, he went intod
the assembly and just by showing himself reduced
them to silence: then, seeing that they had already
repented, he went away without a word.

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="65"><p>
When he realised that he was no longer able
to wait upon himself, he quoted to those who
were with him the verses of the heralds at the
games :

<l>Here endeth a contest awarding the fairest</l>

A short time before the end
he was asked: “What orders have you to give
about your burial?” and replied: “Don’t borrow
trouble! The stench will get me buried!” The
man said: “Why, isn’t it disgraceful that the body
of such a man should be exposed for birds and
dogs to devour?” “I see nothing out of the way
in it,” said he, “if even in death I am going to be
of service to living things.”
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="67"><p>

But the Athenians
gave him a magnificent public funeral and mourned
him Jong. To honour him, they did obeisance to
the stone bench on which he used to rest when he
was tired, and they put garlands on it; for they felt
that even the stone on which he had been wont to
sit was sacred. Everybody attended his burial,
especially the philosophers ; indeed, it was they who
took him on their shoulders and carried him to the
tomb.</p>

<p>
These are a very few things out of many which I
might have mentioned, but they will suffice to give
my readers a notion of the sort of man he was.

Alexander longed to bathe in the Cydnus on
seeing that the stream was fair and clear, safely
deep, agreeably swift, delightful to swim in and cool
in the height of summer; even with foreknowledge
of the fever which he contracted from it, I do not
think he would have abstained from his plunge.
Then can it be that on seeing a hall beyond compare
in the greatness of its size, the splendour of its
beauty, the brilliance of its illumination, the lustre
of its gilding and the gaiety of its pictures, a man
would not long to compose speeches in it, if this
were his business, to seek repute and win glory in
it, to fill it with his voice and, as far as lay in him,
to become part and parcel of its beauty? Or after
looking it over carefully and admiring it, would he
rather go away and leave it mute and voiceless,
without according it a word of greeting or a particle
of intercourse, as if he were dumb or else out of illwill had resolved to hold his tongue?

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="2"><p>

Heracles! such
conduct would not be that of a connoisseur or a
lover of beauty; it would be very vulgar, tasteless,
even Philistine to despise what is sweetest, to reject
what is fairest, and not to comprehend that in all
that appeals to the eye, the same law does not hold
for ordinary and for educated men. No, for the former
it is enough to do the usual thing—just to see, to
look about, to cast their eyes everywhere, to crane


<pb n="179"/>

their necks at the ceiling, to gesticulate and to take
their joy in silence for fear of not being able to say
anything adequate to what they see. But when a
man’ of culture beholds beautiful things, he will not
be content, I am sure, to harvest their charm. with
his eyes alone, and will not endure to be a silent
spectator of their beauty; he will do all he can to
linger there and make some return for the spectacle
in speech.

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="3"><p>

And such a return does not consist
simply in praising the hall. No doubt it was fitting -
for Homer's island boy
<note n="1">Telemachus (Odyss. 4, 71): he compares the house of
Menelaus to the palaces of the gods.</note>
to be astounded at the house
of Menelaus and to compare its ivory and gold to the
beautiful things in heaven because he had never seen
anything else on earth that was beautiful. But to
speak here, to collect an audience of cultured men
and show one’s eloquence is also a form of praise.
It is very delightful, I think, that the fairest of
halls should be flung open for the harbourage of
speech and should be full of praise and laudation;
re-echoing softly like a cavern, following what is
said, drawing out the concluding sounds of the voice
and lingering on the last words ; or, to put it better,
committing to memory all that one says, like an
appreciative hearer, and applauding the speaker and
gracefully repeating his phrases. In some such way
the rocks pipe in answer to the piping of the shepherds when the sound comes back again by repercussion and returns upon itself. The untaught think
it is a maid who answers all who sing and shout,



<pb n="181"/>

abiding somewhere in the heart of the cliffs and
talking from the inside of the crags.

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="4"><p>

To me, at least, it seems that a splendid hall
excites the speaker's fancy and stirs it to speech, as
if he were somehow prompted by what he sees.
No doubt something of beauty flows through the
eyes into the soul, and then fashions into the likeness of itself the words that it sends out. In the
case of Achilles, the sight of his armour enhanced
his anger at the Trojans, and when he put it on to
try it, he was inspired and transported with the lust
of battle.<note n="1">Iliad, 19, 16; 384.</note>
Then are we to believe that the passion
for speech is not enhanced by beautiful surroundings? Socrates was satisfied with a fine plane-tree
and lush grass and a spring of clear water.not far from
the Ilissus: sitting there, he plied his irony at the
expense of Phaedrus of Myrrhinus, criticised the
speech of Lysias, son of Cephalus, and invoked
the Muses, believing that they would come to a
sequestered spot and take part in the debate on
love, and thinking no shame, old as he was, to invite
maids to join him in amorous ditties.

<note n="3">Herod. 7, 27.</note>
May we not
suppose that they would come to a place as beautiful
as this, even without an invitation ?

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="5"><p>
In truth, our shelter is not to be compared with
mere shade or with the beauty of a plane-tree, not
even if you pass over the one on the Ilissus and
mention the Great King’s golden plane.<note n="2">Plato, Phaedrus, 229 seq.</note> That was
wonderful only on account of its cost ; there was no





<pb n="183"/>

craftsmanship or beauty or charm or symmetry or
grace wrought into the gold or combined with it.
The thing was barbarous, nothing but money, a
source of envy to those who saw it, and of felicitation to those who owned it. There was nothing
praiseworthy about it. The Arsacids<note n="1">Anachronism ; the possessors of the tree were the Achaemenid princes.</note>
neither cared
for beauty nor aimed at attractiveness in making
their display nor minded whether the spectators

The
barbarians are not beauty-levers; they are moneylovers. On the contrary, the beauty of this hall
has nothing to do with barbarian eyes, Persian
flattery, or Sultanic vainglory. Instead of just a
poor man, it wants a cultured man for a spectator,
who, instead of judging with his eyes, applies thought
to what he sees.
It faces the fairest quarter of the day (for the
fairest and loveliest is surely the beginning); it
welcomes in the sun when he first peeps up; light
fills it to overflowing through the wide-flung doors ;
the proportion of length to “breadth and of both to
height is harmonious; the windows are generous
and well-suited to every season of the year. Is not
all this attractive and praiseworthy ?

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="7"><p>

One might also admire the ceiling for its reserved
modelling, its flawless decoration, and the refined -
symmetry of its gilding, which is not unnecessarily




<pb n="185"/>

lavish, but only in such degree as would suffice a
modest and beautiful woman to set off her beauty—
a delicate chain round her neck, a light ring on her
finger, pendants in her ears, a buckle, a band that
confines the luxuriance of her hair and adds as much
to her good looks as a purple border adds to a gown.
It is courtesans, especially the less attractive of
them, who have clothing all purple and necks all
gold, trying to secure seductiveness by extravagance
and to make up for their lack of beauty by the
addition of extraneous charms ; they think that their
arms will look whiter when they are bright with
gold, and that the unshapeliness of their feet will
escape notice in golden sandals, and that their very
faces will be lovelier when seen together with
something very bright. This is the course they
follow ; but a modest girl uses only what gold is
sufficient and necessary, and would not be ashamed
of her beauty, I am sure, if she were to show it
unadorned.

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="8"><p>

The ceiling of this hall—call it the face if you
will—well-featured itself, is as much embellished by
the gilding as heaven by the stars at night, with
sprinkled lights and scattered flowers of fire. If all
were fire, it would be terrible, not beautiful, to us.
You will observe that the gilding yonder is not
purposeless, and not intermingled with the rest of the
decorations for its own charm alone. It shines witha


<pb n="187"/>

sweet radiance, and colours the whole hall with its
flush ; for when the light, striking the gold, lays
hold of it and combines with it, they gleam jointly
and make the flush doubly brilliant.

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="9"><p>

Such is the top, the summit of the hall: it
needs a Homer to praise it by calling it “highceiled” like the chamber of Helen
<note n="1">Il. 3, 423; Od. 4. 121.</note><note n="1">Il. 3, 423; Od. 4. 121.</note>

or “dazzling” like
Olympus.

<note n="2">Il. 1, 253; 13, 243; Od. 20, 103.</note>
The rest of the decoration, the frescoes
on the walls, the beauty of their colours, and the
vividness, exactitude, and truth of each detail might
well be compared with the face of spring and with a
flowery field, except that those things fade and
wither and change and cast their beauty, while this
is spring eternal, field unfading, bloom undying.
Naught but the eye touches it and culls the
sweetness of what it sees.

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="10"><p>

Who would not be charmed with the sight or
all these beautiful things? Who would not want to
outdo himself in speaking among them, aware that
it is highly disgraceful not to be a match for that
which one sees? The sight of beauty is seductive,
and not to man alone. Even a horse, I think, would
find more pleasure in running on a soft, sloping plain
that receives his tread pleasantly, yields a little to
his foot, and does not shock his hoof. Then he puts
in play all his power of running, gives himself over
to speed and nothing else, and vies with the beauty
of the plain.

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="11"><p>

The peacock, too, at the opening



<pb n="189"/>

of spring goes to a field at the time when the
biossoms which it puts out are not only lovelier, but,
in a manner of speaking, more blossomy and brighter
of hue; spreading his wings and showing them to
the sun, lifting his tail and surrounding himself with
it, he, too, displays his blossoms and the April of his
wings, as if the field were challenging him to vie with
it. Atall events, he twists and turns and puts on airs
with his beauty. Now and again he is a sight still
more wonderful, when his colours change under the
light, altering a little and turning to a different kind
of loveliness. This happens to him chiefly in the
circles that he has at the tips of his feathers, each
of which is ringed with a rainbow. What was previously bronze has the look of gold when he shifts a
little, and what was bright blue in the sun is bright
green in shadow, so much does the beauty of his
plumage alter with the light!

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="12"><p>

For you know without my telling you that the sea has power to invite
and provoke longing when it is calm. At such a
time, no matter how much of a landsman and a
lubber a man may be, he wants at all costs to get
aboard ship and cruise about and go far from land,
above all if he perceives the breeze gently swelling the
canvas and the vessel sweetly and smoothly gliding
along, little by little, over the crest of the waves.

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="13"><p>

Certainly, then, the beauty. of this hall has
power to rouse a man to speech, to spur him on in
speaking and to make him succeed in every- way. I
for my part am trusting in all this and have already


<pb n="191"/>

trusted in it; in coming to the hall to speak, I was
attracted by its beauty as by a magic wheel or a
Siren, for I had no slight hope that even if my
phrases were homely before, they would seem
beautiful if adorned, so to speak, in fine clothing.

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="14"><p>

There is, however, another point of view, not
insignificant but very important, if you take Mr. Point
o’ View's word for it; he kept interrupting me
as I spoke and trying to break up my speech, and
now that I have paused he says that I am mistaken
in this matter: he is surprised that I should say a
beautiful hall adorned with painting and gilding is
better suited for the display of eloquence, as the case
is entirely the reverse. But if you approve, let Mr.
Point o’ View himself take the floor in his own behalt
and tell you as he would a jury wherein he thinks a
mean and ugly hall more advantageous to the speaker.
You have heard me already, so that I do not need to
speak again to the same topic; let him take the
floor now and say his say, and I will be still and
ield to him for a time.

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="15"><p>

“Well, gentlemen of the jury,” says Mr. Point
o’ View, “the last speaker has made many striking
points in praise of the hall, and has adorned it with
his words. I myself am so far from intending to
criticise it that I have in mind to add the points
which he omitted, for the more beautiful you think
it, the more hostile to the speaker's interest it will
be, as I shall show.

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="16"><p>

“First, then, since he has mentioned women,
jewelry and gold, permit me also to make use of the
comparison. I assert that, far from contributing to
the good looks of a beautiful woman, abundant

<pb n="193"/>

jewelry is actually a detriment. Everyone who
meets her is dazzled by her gold and her expensive
gems, and instead of praising her complexion, her
eyes, her neck, her arm or her finger, he neglects
them and lets his eyes wander ta her sard or her
emerald, her necklace or her bracelet. She might
fairly get angry at being thus slighted for her
ornaments, when observers are too occupied to pay
her compliments and think her looks a side-issue.

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="17"><p>

The same thing is bound to happen, I think, to a man
who tries to show his eloquence among works of art
like these. Amid the mass of beautiful things, what
he says goes unheeded, vanishes and is absorbed, as if a
candle were taken toa great fire and thrown in, or’
an ant pointed out on the back of an elephant or a
camel. This danger, certainly, the speaker must
guard against, and also that his voice be not disturbed
when he speaks in a hall so musical and echoing, for
it resounds, replies, refutes—in fact, it drowns his
utterance, just as the trumpet drowns the flute when
they are played together, and as the sea drowns
chanty-men when they undertake to sing for the
rowers against the noise of the surf. For the great
volume of sound overpowers and crushes into silence
all that is weaker.

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="18"><p>
"As to the other point which my opponent made,
that a beautiful hall spurs a speaker on and makes
him more ambitious, I think it does the opposite.
It dazzles and frightens him, disturbs his thought
and makes him more timid, for he reflects that it is
disgraceful beyond everything that his discourse


<pb n="195"/>

should not match a place so beautiful. For such surroundings put a man most clearly to the proof. It is
’ asif he should put on a handsome coat of mail and then
take to his heels.before the rest, making his cowardice
only the more conspicuous for his armour. This,
‘I think, is the consideration which causes Homer's
famous orator<note n="1">Odysseus: Il. 3, 219.</note> to think very little of good-looks and
even make himself appear ‘ an utter know-nothing’ in
order that the beauty of his words may seem more
striking by comparison with that which is uglier.
Besides, it is inevitable that the speaker’s own mind
should be occupied in looking, and that the accuracy
of his thinking should be disturbed because what he
is looking at gets the better of him, attracts him and
‘does not allow him to attend to what he is saying.
So how can he help speaking very badly, when in
spirit he is busied with the praise of all that he sees?

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="19"><p>

“I forbear to say that even those who are
present and have been invited to the lecture become
spectators instead of hearers when they enter such a
hall as this, and no speaker is enough of a Demodocus, a Phemius, a Thamyris, an Amphion or an
Orpheus to distract their minds from looking. Why,
every one of them is flooded with beauty the instant
he crosses the threshold, and does not give the least
sign of hearing <note n="2">Il, 23, 430.</note> what the speaker says or anything
else, but is all absorbed in what he sees, unless he is
stone-blind or like the court of the Areopagus,
listens in the dark!

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="20"><p>

That the power of the tongue
is no match for the eyes, one can learn by comparing





<pb n="197"/>

the story of the Sirens with the one about the
Gorgons. The Sirens charmed passing voyagers by
making music and working on them with songs, and
held them long when they put in. In short, their
performance only exacted a delay, and no doubt one
or another voyager went by them, neglecting their
music. On the contrary, the beauty of the Gorgons, °
being extremely powerful and affecting the very
vitals of the soul, stunned its beholdersand made
them speechless, so that, as the story has it and
everyone says, they turned to stone in wonder.
For this reason I count what my opponent said
to you a moment ago about the peacock a plea for
my side: surely his attractiveness is in his looks,
not in his voice! If anybody should match a nightingale or a swan against him, letting them sing -
and showing the peacock silent while they were
singing, I “know well that your soul would go
over to him, bidding a long farewell to their songs.
So invincible, it seems, is the delight of the eyes!

If you wish, I will produce you a witness in the
person of a sage, who will testify on the spot that
what one sees is far more effective than what

so kind as to comply, let him take the stand and
give his testimony. Suffer him to speak to you in
Ionic, to which he is accustomed.

a dangerous adversary to a speaker? But 1 ,have

antiquarian interest and instructiveness in their

Perseus is killing the sea-monster and freeing
Andromeda ; in a little while he will marry her and
go away with her. It is an incident to his winged

much in little—the maid’s modesty and terror (for
she is looking down on the fight from the cliff
overhead), the lad’s fond courage and the beast’s
unconquerable mien. ‘As he comes on bristling with

is
already a commonplace. If nothing is sweeter, then
is anything more holy and divine? Truly of all that
men count holy and divine their native land is cause
‘and teacher, in that she bears, nurtures and educates
them. To be sure, many admire cities for their size,
their splendour and the magnificence of their public
works, but everyone loves his own country; and
even among men completely overmastered by the
lust of the eye, no one is so misguided as to be forgetful of it because of the greater number of wonders
in other countries.

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="2"><p>

Therefore a man who prides
himself on being citizen of a prosperous state does
not know, it seems to me, what sort of honour one
should pay his native land, and such an one would
clearly take it ill if his lot had fallen in a less
pretentious place. For my part I prefer to honour
the mere name of native land. In attempting to
compare states, it is proper, of course, to investigate
their size and beauty and the abundance of their supplies; but when it is a question of choosing between
them, nobody would choose the more splendid and
give up his own. He would pray that it too might
be as prosperous as any, but would choose it, no matter
what it was. Upright children and good fathers do



<pb n="213"/>

just the same thing. A lad of birth and breeding
would not honour anyone else above his father, and
a father would not neglect his son and cherish some
other lad. In fact, fathers, influenced by their
affection, give their sons so much more than their
due that they think them the best-looking, the
tallest and the most accomplished in every way.
One who does not judge his son in this spirit does
not seem to me to have a father’s eyes.
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="3"><p>

In the first place, then, the name of fatherland
is closer to one’s heart than all else, for there is
nothing closer than a father. If one pays his father
proper honour, as law and nature direct, then one
should honour his fatherland still more, for his father
himself belonged to if and his father’s father and all
their forbears, and the name of father goes back
until it reaches the father-gods.

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="4"><p>

Even the gods
have countries that they rejoice in, and although
they watch over all the abodes of man, deeming that
every land and every sea is theirs, nevertheless each
honours the place in which he was born above all
other states. Cities are holier when they are homes
of gods, and islands more divine if legends are told
of the birth of gods in them. Indeed, sacrifices
are accounted pleasing to the gods when one goes to
their native places to perform the ceremony. If, then,
the name of native land is in honour with the gods,
should it not be far more so with mankind?

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="5"><p>

Each
of us had his first sight of the sun from his native
land, and so that god, universal though he be, is
nevertheless accounted by everyone a home-god, because of the place from which he saw him first.
Moreover, each of us began to speak there, learning


<pb n="215"/>

first to talk his native dialect, and came to know the
gods there. If a man’s lot has been cast in such a
land that he has required another for his higher
education, he should still be thankful for these early
teachings, for he would not have known even the
meaning of “state” if his country had not taught
him that there was such a thing.

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="6"><p>


The reason, I take it, for which men amass
education and learning is that they may thereby
make themselves more useful to their native land,
and they likewise acquire riches out of ambition to
contribute to its common funds. With reason, I
think: for men should not be ungrateful when
they have received the greatest favours. On the
contrary, if a man returns thanks to individuals,
as is right, when he has been well treated by
them, much more should he requite his country
with its due. To wrong one’s parents is against the
law of the different states; but counting our native
land the common mother of us all, we should give
her thank-offerings for our nurture and for our
knowledge of the law itself.

No one was ever known to be so forgetful of
his country as to care nothing for it when he was
in another state. No, those who get on badly in
foreign parts continually cry out that one’s own
country is the greatest of all blessings, while those
who get on well, however successful they may be in all
else, think that they lack one thing at least, a thing
of the greatest importance, in that they do not live
in their own country but sojourn in a strange land ; for
thus to sojourn is a reproach! And men who during
their years abroad have, become illustrious through
acquirement of wealth, through renown from office-

holding, through testimony to their culture, or
through praise of their bravery, can be seen hurrying
one and all to their native land, as if they thought
they could not anywhere else find better people
before whom to display the evidences of their
success. The more a man is esteemed elsewhere,
the more eager is he to regain his own country.

How much affection real, true citizens have
for their native land can be learned only among a
people sprung from the soil. Newcomers, being but
bastard children, as it were, transfer their allegiance
easily, since they neither know nor love the name of
native land, but expect to be well provided with the
necessities of life wherever they may be,
<note n="1">Cf. Thucydides 1, 1.</note> measuring
happiness by their appetites! On the other hand,
those who have a real mother-country love the soil
on which they were born and bred, even if they own
but little of it, and that be rough and thin. Though
they be hard put to it to praise the soil, they will not
lack words to extol their country. Indeed, when
they see others priding themselves on their open
plains and prairies diversified with all manner of
growing things, they themselves do not forget the

exhortation of the marshalled men is so effective as
“You are fighting for your native land!” No man

<head>OCTOGENERIANS<note>This treatise (evidently compiled in haste for a special
occasion) cannot fairly be fathered on Lucian. It is valuable,
however, as a document, and not uninteresting in spots.</note></head>
<div type="textpart" subtype=" section" n="1"><p>

At the behest of a dream, illustrious Quintillus,
I make you a present of the “Octogenarians.” I
had the dream and told my friends of it long since,
when you were christening your second child. At
the time, however, not being able to understand
what the god meant by commanding me to “present
you the octogenarians,” I merely offered a prayer that
you and your children might live very long, thinking
that this would benefit not only the whole human
race but, more than anyone else, me in person and
all my kin; for I too, it seemed, had a blessing
predicted for me by the god.

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="2"><p>

But as I thought the
matter over by myself, I hit upon the idea that very
likely in giving such an order to a literary man, the
gods were commanding him to present you something from his profession. Therefore, on this your
birthday, which I thought the most auspicious
occasion, I give you the men who are related to have
attained great age with a sound mind and a perfect
body. Some profit may accrue to you from the
treatise in two ways : on the one hand, encouragement
and good hopes of being able to live long yourself,
and on the other hand, instruction by examples, if
you observe that it is the men who have paid most


<pb n="225"/>

attention to body and mind that have reached an
advanced age in full health.

Nestor, you know,
the wisest of the Achaeans, outlasted three genera-
tions, Homer says:
<note n="1">Il, 1, 250; Odyss. 3, 245.</note>
and he tells us that he was
splendidly trained. in mind and in body. ‘Likewise
Teiresias the seer outlasted six generations, tragedy
says:<note n="2">The source is unknown.</note>
and one may well believe that a man
consecrated to the gods, following a simpler diet,
lives very long.

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="4"><p>

Moreover, it is related that, owing
to their diet, whole castes of men live long like
the so-called scribes in Egypt, the story-tellers
in Syria and Arabia, and the so-called Brahmins in
India, men scrupulously attentive to philosophy.
Also the so-called Magi, a prophetic caste consecrated to the gods, dwelling among the Persians,
the Parthians, the Bactrians, the Chorasmians, the
Arians, the Sacae, the Medes and many other
barbarian peoples, are strong and long-lived, on
account of practising magic, for they diet very scrupulously.

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="5"><p>
Indeed, there are even whole nations that
are very long-lived, like the Seres, who are said to live
three hundred years: some attribute their old age to
the climate, others to the soil and still others to their
diet, for they say that this entire nation drinks
nothing but water. The people of Athos are also
said to live a hundred and thirty years, and it is
reported that the Chaldeans live more than a
hundred, using barley bread to preserve the sharpness of their eyesight. They say, too, that on
account of this diet their other faculties are more
vigorous than those of the rest of mankind.

<pb n="227"/>

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="6"><p>
But this must suffice in regard to the long-lived
castes and nations who are said to exist for a
very long period either on account of their soil and
climate, or of their diet, or of both. I can fittingly show
you that your good hopes are of easy attainment by
recounting that on every soil and in every clime men
who observe the proper exercise and the diet most
suitable for health have been long-lived.

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="7"><p>

I shall
base the principal division of my treatise on their
pursuits, and shall first tell you of the kings and the
generals, one of whom the gracious dispensation of a
great and godlike emperor has brought to the
highest rank, thereby conferring a mighty boon upon
the emperor’s world.
<note n="1">The man is unknown: the emperor has been thought
to be Antoninus Pius, Caracalla, and many another. The
language, which suggests a period much later than Lucian,
is so obscure that the meaning is doubtful.</note>
In this way it will be possible
for you, observing your similarity to these octogenarians in condition and fortune, to have better
expectations of a healthy and protracted old age,
and by imitating them in your way of living to
make your life at once long and healthy in a high
degree.

Numa Pompilius, most fortunate of the kings

who have lived longest in the rest of Italy. The
list will be a competent refutation of those who
attempt to malign our climate here; and so we may

Hieronymus, who made the campaign with him.
Lysimachus, king of Macedonia, also lost his life in
the battle with Seleucus in his eightieth year, as
the same Hieronymus says. There was also an
Antigonus who was son of Demetrius and grandson
of Antigonus One-eye: he was king of Macedonia
for forty-four years and lived eighty, as Medeius and
other writers say. So too Antipater, son of Iolaus,

Cyrus, king ot
the Persians in olden times, according to the Persian
and Assyrian annals (with which Onesicritus, who
wrote a history of Alexander, seems to agree) at the
age of a hundred asked for all his friends by name and
learned that most of them had been put to death by
his son Cambyses. When Cambyses asserted that he
had done this by order of Cyrus, he died of a broken
heart, partly because he had been slandered for his
son’s cruelty, partly because he accused himself of
being feeble-minded.

Artaxerxes, called the Unforgetting, against whom Cyrus, his brother, made the
expedition, was king of Persia when he died of illness
at the age of eighty-six (according to Dinon ninetyfour). Another Artaxerxes, king of Persia, who,
Isidore the Characene historian says, occupied the
throne in the time of Isidore’s fathers, was assassinated at the age of ninety-three through the
machinations of his brother Gosithras. Sinatroces,

These are the kings who have been recorded as
long-lived by our predecessors. Since philosophers
and literary men in general, doubtless because they too
take good care of themselves, have attained old age,

I shall put down those whom there is record of,
beginning with the philosophers. Democritus ot
Abdera starved himself to death at the age of one
hundred and four. ' -Xenophilus the musician, we are
told by Aristoxenus, adopted the philosophical
system of Pythagoras, and lived in Athens. more
than one hundred and five years. Solon, Thales,
and Pittacus, who were of the so-called seven wise
men, each lived a hundred years, and Zeno, the
head of the Stoic school, ninety-eight.

They say
that when Zeno stumbled in entering the assembly,
he cried out: “Why do you call me?”
<note n="1">Addressed to Pluto. According to Diogenes Laertius

Trag. Gr. Fragm. p. 51).</note>
and then,
returning home, starved himself to death. Cleanthes,
the pupil and successor of Zeno, was ninety-nine’
when he got a tumour on his lip. He was fasting
when letters from certain of his friends arrived, but
he had food brought him, did what his friends had
requested, and then fasted anew until he passed

Of the historians, Ctesibius died at the age of one

Apollodorus in his Chronology. Hieronymus, who
went to war and stood much toil and many wounds,
lived one hundred and four years, as Agatharchides
says in the ninth book of his History of Asia; and
he expresses his amazement at the man, because up
to his last day he was still vigorous in his marital
relations and in all his faculties, lacking none of the
symptoms of health. Hellanicus of Lesbos was
eighty-five, Pherecydes the Syrian eighty-five also,
Timaeus of Tauromenium ninety-six. Aristobulus
of Cassandria is said to have lived more than ninety
years. He began to write his history in his eightyfourth year, for he says so himself in the beginning of

other people’s invitations to dinner! Isocrates
wrote his Panegyric at ninety-six ; and at the age of
ninety-nine, when he learned that the Athenians
had been beaten by Philip in the battle of Chaeronea,
he groaned and uttered the Euripidean line

alluding to himself; then, adding, “Greece will lose
her liberty,” he quitted life. Apollodorus, the Pergamene rhetorician who was tutor to Caesar Augustus

One of them is Ctesias, son of
Ctesiochus, of Cnidos, who wrote a great deal about
India and its characteristics that he had never seen
himself nor heard from anyone else with a reputation
for truthfulness. Iambulus also wrote much that
was strange about the countries in the great sea: he
made up a falsehood that is patent to everybody, but
wrote a story that is not uninteresting for all that.
<note n="1">The writings of Ctesias and Iambulus are lost; also those
of Antonius Diogenes, whose story, On the Wonders beyond
Thule, was according to Photius (Bibb., cod. 166, 111 b) the
fountain-head of Lucian’s tale.</note>
Many others, with the same intent, have written about
imaginary travels and journeys of theirs, telling of
huge beasts, cruel men and strange ways of living.
Their guide and instructor in this sort of charlatanry
is Homer’s Odysseus, who tells Alcinous and his
court about winds in bondage, one-eyed men, carfnibals and savages; also about animals with many
heads, and transformations of his comrades wrought
with drugs. This stuff, and much more like it, is

down to posterity, that I might not be the only one
excluded from the privileges of poetic licence, and
as I had nothing true to tell, not having had any
adventures of significance, I took to lying. But my
lying is far more honest than theirs, for though I
tell the truth in nothing else, I shall at least be
truthful in saying that I ama liar. I think I can
escape the censure of the world by my own admission that I am not telling a word of truth. Be it

Once upon a time, setting out from the Pillars
of Hercules and heading for the western ocean with
a fair wind, I went a-voyaging. The motive and
purpose of my journey lay in my intellectual activity
and desire for adventure, and in my wish to find
out what the end of the ocean was, and who the
people were that lived on the other side. On this
account I put aboard a good store of provisions,
stowed water enough, enlisted in the venture fifty of
my acquaintances who were like-minded with myself,
got together also a great quantity of arms, shipped
the best sailing-master to be had at a big inducement, and put my boat—she was a pinnace—in trim
for a long and difficult voyage.

Well, for a day and
a night we sailed before the wind without making
very much offing, as land was still dimly in sight ; but
at sunrise on the second day the wind freshened, the -



<pb n="255"/>

sea rose, darkness came on, and before we knew it we
could no longer even get our canvas in. Committing
ourselves to the gale and giving up, we drove for
seventy-nine days. On the eightieth day, however,
the sun came out suddenly and at no great distance
we saw a high, wooded island ringed about with
sounding surf, which, however, was not rough, as
already the worst of the storm was abating.
<note n="1">This paragraph is based on Iambulus (Diod. 2. 55).</note></p>

<p>Putting in and going ashore, we lay on the ground
for some time in consequence of our long misery, but

stay and guard the ship and twenty to go inland with

When we had gone
forward through the wood about three furlongs from
the sea, we saw a slab of bronze, inscribed with
Greek letters, faint and obliterated, which said : “To
this point came Hercules and Dionysus.” There
were also two footprints in the rock close by, one of
which was a hundred feet long, the other less—to
my thinking, the smaller one was left by Dionysus,
the other by Hercules.
<note n="2">Cf. Herod. 4, 82; a footprint of Hercules, two cubits

went on, but had not gone far when we came upon a
river of wine, just as like as could be to Chian.
<note n="3">Cf. Ctesias (Phot. cod. 72, 46 a).</note>

The
stream was large and full, so that in places it was
actually navigable. Thus we could not help having
much greater faith in.the inscription on the slab,
seeing the evidence of Dionysus’ visit. I resolved




<pb n="257"/>

to find out where the river took its rise, and
went up along the stream. What I found was
not a source, but a number of large grapevines,
full of clusters; beside the root of each flowed a
spring of clear wine, and the springs gave rise to the
river. There were many fish to be seen in it, very
similar to wine in colour and in taste. In fact, on
catching and eating some of them, we became drunk,
and when we cut into them we found them full
of lees, of course. Later on, we bethought ourselves
to mix with them the other kind of fish, those from
the water, and so temper the strength of our edible
wine.

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="8"><p>

Next, after crossing the river at a place where
it was fordable, we found something wonderful in
grapevines. The part which came out of the ground,
the trunk itself, was stout and well-grown, but the
upper part was in each case a woman, entirely perfect from the waist up. They were like our pictures
of Daphne turning into a tree when Apollo is just
catching her. Out of their finger-tips grew the
branches, and they were full of grapes. Actually,
the hair of their heads was tendrils and leaves and
clusters! When we came up, they welcomed and
greeted us, some of them speaking Lydian, some
Indian, but the most part Greek. They even kissed
us on the lips, and everyone that was kissed at once
became reeling drunk. They did not suffer us, however, to gather any of the fruit, but cried out in pain
when it was plucked. Some of them actually wanted
us to embrace them, and two of my comrades complied, but could not get away again. They were
‘held fast by the part which had touched them, for it
257
VOL. I. 8

had grown in and struck root. Already branches
had grown from their fingers, tendrils entwined
them, and they were on the point of bearing fruit
like the others any minute.

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="9"><p>

Leaving them in the
lurch, we made off to the boat, and on getting there,
told the men we had left behind about everything,
including the affair of our comrades with the vines.
Then, taking jars, we furnished ourselves not only
with water but with wine from. the river, encamped
for the night on the beach close by, and at daybreak
put to sea with a moderate breeze.</p>
<p>
About noon, when the island was no longer in
sight, a whirlwind suddenly arose, spun the boat
about, raised her into the air about three hundred
furlongs and did not let her down into the sea again ;
but while she was hung up aloft a wind struck her
sails and drove her ahead with bellying canvas.

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="10"><p>

For
seven days and seven nights we sailed the air, and on
the eighth day we saw a great country in it, resembling an island, bright and round and shining with
a great light. Running in there and anchoring, we
went ashore, and on investigating found that the land
was inhabited and cultivated. By day nothing was
in sight from the place, but as night came on we
began to see many other islands hard by, some
larger, some smaller, and they were like fire in
colour. We also saw another country below, with
cities in it and rivers and seas and forests and
mountains, This we inferred to be our own world.</p>

<p>
We determined to go still further inland, but
we met what they call the Vulture Dragoons,
and were arrested. These are men riding on large


<pb n="261"/>

vultures and using the birds for horses. The
vultures are large and for the most part have
three heads : you can judge of their size from the
fact that the mast of a large merchantman is not
so long or so thick as the smallest of the quills they
have.
<note n="1">Cf. Odyss. 9, 322f.</note>
The Vulture Dragoons are commissioned to
fly about the country and bring before the king any
stranger they may find, so of course they arrested us
and brought us before him.



When he had looked us
over and drawn his conclusions from our clothes, he
said: “Then you are Greeks, are you, strangers?”
and when we assented, “Well, how did you get here,
with so much air to cross?" We told him all, and
he began and told us about himself: that he too was
a human being, Endymion by name, who had once
been ravished from our country in his sleep, and on
coming there had been made king of the land. He
said that his country was the moon that shines down
on us.
<note n="2">The story of Antonius Diogenes included a description of
a trip to the moon (Phot. 1lla). Compare also Tucian’s
own Icaromenippus.</note>
He urged us to take heart, however, and
suspect no danger, for we should have everything
that we required.

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="11"><p>
“And if I succeed,” said he,
“in the war which I am now making on the people
of the sun, you shall lead the happiest of lives with
me.” We asked whothe enemy were, and what the
quarrel was about. “Phaethon,’ said he, “the king
of the inhabitants of the sun—for it is inhabited,
<note n="3">Cf. Lactantius 3, 23, 41: “Seneca says that there have
been Stoics who raised the question of ascribing to the sun
a population of its own."</note>

<pb n="263"/>

you know, as well as the moon—has been at war with
us for a long time now. It began in this way. Once
upon a time I gathered together the poorest people
in my kingdom and undertook to plant a colony on
the Morning Star, which was empty and uninhabited.
Phaethon out of jealousy thwarted the colonisation,
meeting us half-way at the head of his Ant Dragoons.
At that time we were beaten, for we were not a
match for them in strength, and we retreated:
now, however, I desire to make war again and plant.
the colony. If you wish, then, you may take part
with me in the expedition and I will give each of
you one of my royal vultures and a complete outfit.
We shall take the field to-morrow.” “Very well,”
said I, “since you think it best.”

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="12"><p>


That night we stopped there as his guests, but
at daybreak we arose and took our posts, for the
scouts signalled that the enemy was near. The
number of our army was a hundred thousand, apart
from the porters, the engineers, the infantry and the
foreign allies ; of this total, eighty thousand were
Vulture Dragoons and twenty thousand Grassplumeriders, The Grassplume is also a very large bird, which
instead-of plumage is all shaggy with grass and has
wings very like lettuce-leaves. Next to these the
Millet-shooters and the Garlic-fighters were posted.
Endymion also had allies who came from the Great
Bear—thirty thousand Flea-archers and fifty thousand
Volplaneurs. The Flea-archers ride on great fleas,


<pb n="265"/>

from which they get their name; the fleas are as
large as twelve elephants. The Volplaneurs are
infantry, to be sure, but they fly in the air without
wings. As to the manner of their flight, they pull
their long tunics up through their girdles, let
the baggy folds fill with wind as if they were sails,
and are carried along like boats. For the most part
they serve as light infantry in battle. It was said, too,
that the stars over Cappadocia would send seventy
thousand Sparrowcorns and five thousand Crane
Dragoons. I did not get a look at them, as they did
not come, so I have not ventured to write about
their characteristics, for the stories about them were
wonderful and incredible.
<note n="1">Compare the reticence of Herodotus (1, 193), Thucydides
(3, 113, 6), and Tacitus (Germ. 46).</note>

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="13"><p>


These were the forces of Endymion. They all
had the same equipment—helmets of beans (their
beans are large and tough); scale-corselets of
lupines (they sew together the skins of lupines to
make the corselets, and in that country the skin of
the lupine is unbreakable, like horn); shields
and swords of the Greek pattern.

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="14"><p>
When the time
came, they took position thus; on the right wing,
the Vulture Dragoons and the king, with the bravest
about him (we were among them); on the left, the
Grassplumes; in the centre, the allies, in whatever
formation they liked. The infantry came to about
sixty million, and was deployed as follows. Spiders
in that country are numerous and large, all of them
far larger than the Cyclades islands. They were



<pb n="267"/>

commissioned by the king to span the air between
the Moon and the Morning Star with a web, and as
soon as they had finished and had made a plain, he
deployed his infantry on it. Their leaders were
Owlett son of Fairweather, and two others.

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="15"><p>


As to the enemy, on the left were the Ant
Dragoons, with whom was Phaethon. They are very
large beasts with wings, like the ants that we have,
except in size: the largest one was two hundred feet
long.
<note n="1">Herodotus (3, 102) tells of ants bigger than foxes.</note>
They themselves fought, as well as their
riders, and made especially good use of their feelers.
They were said to number about fifty thousand. On
their right were posted the Sky-mosquitoes,
numbering also about fifty thousand, all archers
riding on large mosquitoes. Next to them were the
Sky-dancers, a sort of light infantry, formidable
however, like all the rest, for they slung radishes at
long range, and any man that they hit could not hold
out a moment, but died, and his wound was
malodorous. They were said to anoint their missiles
with mallow poison. Beside them were posted the
Stalk-mushrooms, heavy infantry employed at close
quarters, ten thousand in number. They had the
name Stalk-mushrooms because they used mushrooms
for shields and stalks of asparagus for spears. Near
them stood the Puppycorns, who were sent him by
the inhabitants of the Dog-star, five thousand dogfaced men who fight on the back of winged acorns.

<note n="2">Herodotus (4, 191) tells of dog-headed men and of
headless men with eyes in their breasts.</note>


<pb n="269"/>

It was said that there were tardy allies in Phaethon’s
tase, too—the slingers whom he had summoned from
the Milky Way, and the Cloud-centaurs. The latter
to be sure, arrived just after the battle was over
(if only they had not!); but the slingers did not put
in an appearance at all. On account of this, they
say, Phaethon was furious with them and afterwards
ravaged their country with fire.

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="16"><p>

This, then, was the array with which Phaethon
came on. Joining battle when the flags had been
flown and the donkeys on both sides had brayed (for
they had donkeys for trumpeters), they fought. The -
left wing of the Sunites fled at. once, without even
receiving the charge of the Vulture Horse, and we
pursued, cutting them down. But their right wing got
the better of the left on our side, and the Sky-mosquitoes advanced in pursuit right up to the infantry.
Then, when the infantry came to the rescue, they
broke and fled, especially as they saw that the forces
on their left had been defeated. It was a glorious
victory, in which many were taken alive and many
were slain; so much blood flowed on the clouds that
they were dyed and looked red, as they do in our
country when the sun is setting, and so much also
dripped down on the earth that I wonder whether
something of the sort did not take place in the sky
long ago, when Homer supposed that Zeus had sent
a rain of blood on account of the death of Sarpedon.1
<note n="1">Il. 16, 459.</note>
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="17"><p>

When we had returned from.the pursuit we set up
two trophies, one on the spider-webs for the infantry
battle and the other, for the sky battle, on the clouds.



<pb n="271"/>

We were just doing this when the scouts reported
that the Cloud-centaurs, who should have come to
Phaethon’s aid before the battle, were advancing on
us. Before we knew it, they were coming on in
plain sight, a most unparalleled spectacle, being a
combination of winged horses and men. In size the
men were as large as the Colossus of Rhodes from
_ the waist up, and the horses were as large as a great
merchantman. Their number, however, I leave
unrecorded for fear that someone may think it
incredible, it was so great. Their leader was the
Archer from the Zodiac. When they saw that their
friends had been defeated, they sent word to
Phaethon to advance again, and then, on their own
account, in regular formation fell on the disordered
Moonites, who had broken ranks and scattered to
pursue and to plunder. They put them all to flight,
pursued the king himself to the city and killed most
of his birds; they plucked up the trophies and overran the whole plain woven by the spiders, and they
captured me with two of my comrades. By this
time Phaethon too was present, and other trophies
were being set up by their side.
As for us, we were taken off to the sun that day,
our hands tied behind our backs with a section of
spider-web.

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="18"><p>

The enemy decided not to lay siege
to the city, but on their way back they built a
wall through the air, so that the rays of the sun
should no longer reach the moon. The wall was
double, made of cloud, so that a genuine eclipse of the
moon took place, and she was completely enshrouded


<pb n="273"/>

in unbroken night. Hard pressed by this, Endymion
sent and begged them to pull down the construction
and not let them lead their lives in darkness. He
promised to pay tribute, to be an ally and not to
make war again, and volunteered to give hostages
for all this. Phaethon and his people held two
assemblies ; on the first day they did not lay aside a
particle of ‘their anger, but on the second day they
softened, and the peace was made on these terms:
<note n="1">Compare the Athenian-Spartan treaty, Thuc. 5, 18.</note>

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="19"><p>


On the following conditions the Sunites and their
allies make peace with the Moonites and Heir allies,
to wit:
That the Sunites tear down the dividing- wall and
do not invade the moon again, and that they make
over the prisoners of war, each at a set ransom ;
</p>

<p>That the Moonites permit the stars tu be autonomous, and do not make war on the Sunites ;</p>

<p>
That each country aid the other if it be attacked ;</p>

<p>
That in yearly tribute the King of the Moonites
pay the King of the Sunites ten thousand gallons of
dew, and that he give ten thousand of his people as
hostages ;</p>

<p>
That the colony on the Morning Star be planted
in common, and that anyone else who so desires may
take part in it;</p>

<p>
That the treaty be inseribed on a slab of electrum
and set up in mid-air, on the common confines.
Attested under hand and seal.</p>

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="20"><p>
On those terms peace was made, and then the wall
was torn down at once and we prisoners were restored.
When we reached the moon we were met and tearfully
welcomed by our comrades and by Endymion himself. He wanted me to stay with him and join the
colony, promising to give me his own son in
marriage—there are no women in their country.
But I was not to be persuaded ; I asked him to let
me go down to the sea. When he perceived that he
could not prevail on me, he let us go after
entertaining us for seven days.

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="21"><p>

In the interval, while I was living on the moon,
I observed some strange and wonderful things
that I wish to speak of. In the first place there is
the fact that they are not born of women but of
men: they marry men and do not even know the
word woman at all! Up to the age of twenty-five
each is a wife, and thereafter a husband: They
carry their children in the calf of the leg instead of
the belly. When conception takes place the calf
begins to swell. In course of time they cut it open
and deliver the child dead, and then they bring it
to life by putting it in the wind with its mouth
open. It seems to me that the term “belly of the
leg"
<note n="1">i.e, calf of the leg. </note> came to us Greeks from there, since the leg
performs the function of a belly with them. But I
will tell you something else, still more wonderful.
They have a kind of men whom they call the
Arboreals, who are brought into the world as follows:
Exsecting a man’s right genital gland, they plant it
in the ground. From it grows a very large tree of



<pb n="277"/>

flesh, resembling the emblem of Priapus: it has
branches and leaves; and its fruit is acorns a cubit
thick. When these ripen, they harvest them and shell
out the men. Another thing, they have artificial
parts that are sometimes of ivory and sometimes,
with the poor, of wood, and make use of them in
their intercourse.

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="22"><p>

When a man grows old, he does
not die, but is dissolved like smoke and turns into
air. They all eat the same food; they light a fire
and cook frogs on the coals—they have quantities of
frogs, that fly about in the air—and while they are
cooking, they sit about them as if at table, snuff up
the rising smoke and gorge themselves.
<note n="1">Cf. Herod. 1, 202; 4, 75; Strabo 15, 1, 57.</note> This is
the food they eat, and their drink is air, which is
squeezed into a cup and yields a liquid like dew.
They are not subject to calls of nature, which, in
fact, they have no means of answering. Another
important function, too, is not provided for as one
would expect, but in the hollow of the knee.</p>


<p>
A man is thought beautiful in that country if
he is bald and hairless, and they quite detest long-haired people. It is different on the comets, where
they think long-haired people beautiful—there were
visitors in the moon who told us about them.
<note n="2">The point of this is that κομήτης, whence our word comet,
means long-haired.</note>
Another point—they have beards that grow a little
above the knee, and they have no toe-nails, but are
all single-toed. Over each man’s rump grows a long
cabbage-leaf, like a tail, which is always green and




<pb n="279"/>

does not break if he falls on his back.

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="23"><p>

Their noses
run honey of great pungency, and when they work
or take exercise, they sweat milk all over , their
bodies, of such quality that cheese can actually be
made from it by dripping in a little of the honey.
They make oil from onions, and it is very clear and
sweet-smelling, like myrrh. They have many watervines, the grapes. of which are like hailstones, and to
my thinking, the hail that falls down on.us is due
to the bursting. of the bunches when a wind strikes
and shakes, those vines. They use their bellies for
pockets, putting into them anything they have use
for,as they can open and shut them. These parts
do not seem to have any intestines in them or anything else, except that they are all shaggy and hairy
inside, so that the children enter them when it is
cold.

and
that of the poor, spun bronze; for that region is
rich in bronze, which they work like wool by
wetting it with water. I am reluctant to tell you
what sort of eyes they have, for fear that you may
think me lying on account of the incredibility
of the story, but I will tell you, notwithstanding.
The eyes that they have are removable, and whenever they wish they take them out and put them
away until they want to see: then they put them in
and look. Many, on losing their own, borrow other
people’s to see with, and the rich folk keep a quantity

A large
looking-glass is fixed above a well, which is not very
deep. If a man goes down into the well, he hears
everything that is said among us on earth, and if he
looks into the looking-glass he sees every city and
every country just as if he were standing over it.

native land, but I cannot go further and say for
certain whether they also saw me. Anyone who

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="26"><p>

To go back to my story, we embraced the king and
his friends, went aboard, and put off. Endymion even
gave me presents—two of the glass tunics, five of
bronze, and a suit of lupine armour—but I left them
all behind in the whale. He also sent a thousand
Vulture Dragoons with us to escort us for sixty miles.

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="27"><p>

On our way ‘we passed many countries and put
in at the Morning Star, which was just being
colonised. We landed there and procured water.
Going aboard and making for the zodiac, we passed
the sun to port, hugging the shore. We did not
land, though many of my comrades wanted to; for
the wind was unfavourable. But we saw that the
country was green and fertile and well-watered, and
full of untold good things. On seeing us, the Cloudcentaurs, who had entered the service of Phaethon,


<pb n="283"/>

flew up to the ship and then went away again when
they found out that the treaty protected us.

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="28"><p>

The
Vulture Dragoons had already left us.
Sailing the next night and day we reached Lamptown toward evening, already being on our downward way. This city lies in the air midway between
the Pleiades and the Hyades, though much lower
than the Zodiac. On landing, we did not find any
men at all, but a lot of lamps running about and
loitering in the public square and at the harbour.
Some of them were small and poor, so to speak; a
few, being great and powerful, were very splendid
and conspicuous. Each of them has his own house,
or sconce, they have names like men, and we heard -
them talking. They offered us no harm, but invited
us to be their guests. We were afraid, however,
and none of us ventured to eat a mouthful or close
an eye. They have a public building in the centre
of the city, where their magistrate sits all night and
" ealls each of them by name, and whoever does not
answer is sentenced to death for deserting. They
are executed by being put out. We were at court,
saw what went on, and heard the lamps defend
themselves and tell why they came late. There I
recognised our own lamp: I spoke to hm and
enquired how things were at home, and he told
me all about them.</p>

<p>
That night we stopped there, but on the next day
we set sail and continued our voyage. By this time


<pb n="285"/>

we were near the clouds. There we saw the city
of Cloudcuckootown,
<note n="1">The capital of Birdland in Aristophanes’ play, The Birds.</note>
and wondered at it, but did
not visit it, as the wind did not permit. The king,
however, was said to be Crow Dawson. It made me
think of Aristophanes the poet, a wise and truthful man whose writings are distrusted without
reason. On the next day but one, the ocean was
already in plain sight, but no land anywhere except
the countries in the air, and they began to appear
fiery and bright. Toward noon on the fourth day
the wind fell gently and gave out, and we were
set down on the sea.

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="29"><p>
When we touched the water
we were marvellously pleased and happy, made as
merry as.we could in every way, and went over the
side for a swim, for by good luck it was calm and the
sea was smooth.</p>

<p>It would seem, however, that a change for the
better often proves a prelude to greater ills. We
had sailed just two days in fair weather and the third
day was breaking when toward sunrise we suddenly
saw a number of sea-monsters, whales. One among
them, the largest of all, was fully one hundred and
fifty miles long. He came at us with open mouth,
dashing up the sea far in advance, foam-washed,
showing teeth much larger than the emblems of
Dionysus in our country,
<note n="2">On the size of these, see Lucian’s Syrian Goddess, 28.</note> and all sharp as calthrops
and white as ivory. We said good-bye to one
another, embraced, and waited. He was there in an




<pb n="287"/>

instant, and with a gulp swallowed us down, ship
and all. He just missed crushing us with his teeth,
but the boat slipped through the gaps between
them into the interior.

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="30"><p>

When we were inside, it
was dark at first, and we could not see anything,
but afterwards, when he opened his mouth, we saw
a great cavity, flat all over and high, and large
enough for the housing of a great city. In it
there were fish, large and small, and many other
creatures all mangled, ships’ rigging and anchors,
human bones, and merchandise. In the middle
there was land with hills on it, which to my thinking
was formed of the mud that he had swallowed.
Indeed, a forest of all kinds of trees had grown on
it, garden stuff had come up, and_ everything
appeared to be under cultivation. The coast of the
island was twenty-seven miles long. Sea-birds were
to be seen nesting on the trees, gulls and kingfishers.
<note n="1">This story of the whale is no longer considered a parody
on Jonah’s adventure, as there were other versions of the
tale afloat in antiquity.</note>

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="31"><p>


At first we shed tears for a long time, and then
I roused my comrades and we provided for the ship
by shoring it up and for ourselves by rubbing sticks
together, lighting a fire and getting dinner as best
we could. We had at hand plenty of fish’ of all
kinds, and we still had the water from the Morning
Star. On rising the next day, whenever the whale
opened his mouth we saw mountains one moment,
nothing but sky the next, and islands frequently,
and we perceived by this that he was rushing swiftly
to all parts of the sea. When at Jength we became



<pb n="289"/>

wonted to our abiding-place, I took seven of my
comrades and went into the forest, wishing to have
a look at everything. I had not yet gone quite five
furlongs when I found a temple of Poseidon, as the
inscription indicated, and not far from it a number
of graves with stones on them. Near by was a
spring of clear water. We also heard the barking of
a dog, smoke appeared in the distance, and we made
out something like a farmhouse, too.

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="32"><p>


Advancing eagerly, we came upon an old man
and a boy very busily at work in a garden which
they were irrigating with water from the spring.
Joyful and fearful at the same instant, we stopped
still, and they too, probably feeling the same as
we, stood there without a word. In course of time
the old man said: “Who are you, strangers? Are
you sea-gods, or only unlucky men like us? As for
ourselves, though we are men and were bred on land,
we have become sea-creatures and swim about with
this beast which encompasses us, not even knowing for certain what our condition is—we suppose
that we are dead, but trust that we are alive.”
To this I replied: “We too are men, my good
sir—newcomers, who were swallowed up yesterday,
ship and all: and we set out just now with the
notion of finding out how things were in the forest,
for it appeared to be very large and thick. But
some divinity, it seems, brought us to see you and
to discover that we are not the only people shut up
in this animal. Do tell us your adventures—who
you are and how you got in here.” But he said he
would neither tell us nor question us before giving.
us what entertainment he could command, and he
289
VoL. I. u
<pb n="291"/>

took us with him to the house. It was a commodious structure, had bunks built in it and was fully
furnished in other ways. He set before us vegetables,
fruit and fish and poured us out wine as well.
When we had had enough, he asked us what had
happened to us.” I told him about everything from
first to last—the storm, the island, the cruise in the
air, the war and all the rest of it up to our descent
into the whale.

2

He expressed huge wonder, and then told us his
own story, saying: “By birth, strangers, J am a
Cypriote. Setting out from my native land on a
trading venture with my boy whom you see and with
many servants besides, I began a voyage to Italy,
bringing various wares on a great ship, which you
no doubt saw wrecked in the mouth of the whale.
As far as Sicily we had a fortunate voyage, but
there we were caught by a violent wind and driven
out into the ocean for three days, where we fell in
with the whale, were swallowed up crew and all,
and only we two survived, the others being killed.
We buried our comrades, built a temple to Poseidon
and live this sort of life, raising vegetables and
eating fish and nuts. As you see, the forest is
extensive; and besides, it contains many grape-vines,
which yield the sweetest of wine. No doubt you
noticed the spring of beautiful cold water, too. g We
make our bed of leaves, burn all the wood we want,
snare the birds that fly in, and catch fresh fish by
going into the gills of the animal. We also bathe
there when we care to. Another thing, there is a


<pb n="293"/>

Jake not far off, twenty furlongs in circumference,
with all kinds of fish in it, where we swim and sail
in a little skiff that I made. It is now twenty-seven
years since we were swallowed.

ant, being unsociable and savage.” ‘ What!” said I,
“are there other people in the whale, too?” “Why,
yes, lots of them,” said he; “they are unfriendly
and are oddly’ built. In the western part of the
forest, the tail part, live the Broilers, an eel-eyed,
lobster-faced people that are warlike and bold, and
carnivorous. On one side, by the starboard wall,
live the Mergoats,
<note n="1">According to Herodotus (2, 46), uévdns was Egyptian for
goat ; but there is nothing goatish in the Tritonomendetes as
Lucian describes them.</note>
like men above and catfish below :
they are not so wicked as the others. To port
there are the Crabclaws and the Codheads, who are
friends and allies with each other. The interior
is inhabited by Clan Crawfish and the Solefeet, good
fighters and swift runners. The eastern part, that
near the mouth, is mostly uninhabited, as it is
subject to inundations of the sea. I live in it,
however, paying the Solefeet a tribute of five
hundred oysters a year.

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="34"><p>
Such being the nature
of the country, it is for you to see how we can fight
with all these tribes and how we are to get a living.”
“How many are there of them in all?” said I.
"More than a thousand,” said he. “What sort of
weapons have they?” “Nothing but fishbones,”



<pb n="295"/>

he said. “Then our best plan,” said I, “would be
to meet them in battle, as they are unarmed and
we have arms. If we defeat them, we shall live
here in peace the rest of our days.”</p>

<p>
This was resolved on, and we went to the boat and
made ready. The cause of war was to be the withholding of the tribute, since the date for it had
already arrived. They sent and demanded the tax,
and he gave the messengers a contemptuous answer
and drove them off. First the Solefeet and Clan
Crawfish, incensed at Scintharus—for that was his
name—came on with a great uproar.
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="35"><p>

Anticipating their attack, we were waiting under arms,
having previously posted in our front a squad
of twenty-five men in ambush, who had been
dirécted to fall on the enemy when they saw that
they had gone by, and this they did. Falling on
them in the rear, they cut them down, while we
ourselves, twenty-five in number (for Scintharus and
his son were in our ranks), met them face to face
and, engaging them, ran our hazard with strength
and spirit. Finally we routed them and pursued
them clear to their dens. The slain on the side of
the enemy were one hundred and seventy ; on our
side, one—the sailing-master, who was run through
the midriff with a mullet-rib.

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="36"><p>
That day and night
we bivouacked on the field and made a trophy
by setting up the dry spine of a dolphin. On the
following day the others, who had heard of it,
appeared, with the Broilers, led by Tom Cod, on the
right wing, the Codheads on the left, and the


<pb n="297"/>

Crabclaws in the centre. The Mergoats did not
take the field, choosing not to ally themselves with
either party. Going out to meet them, we engaged
them by the temple of Poseidon with great shouting,
and the hollow re-echoed like a cave. Routing them,
as they were light-armed, and pursuing them into the
forest, we were thenceforth masters of the land.

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="37"><p>


Not long afterwards they sent heralds and were
for recovering their dead and conferring about
an alliance, but we did not think it best to make
terms with them. Indeed, on the following day we
marched against them and utterly exterminated
them, all but the Mergoats, and they, when they
saw what was doing, ran off through the gills and
threw themselves into the sea. Occupying the
country, which was now clear of the enemy, we
dwelt there in peace from that time on, constantly
engaging in sports, hunting, tending vines and
gathering the fruit of the trees. In short, we
resembled men leading a life of luxury and roaming
at large m a great prison that they cannot break
out of.

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="38"><p>


For a year and eight months we lived in this way,
but on the fifth day of the ninth month, about the
second mouth-opening—for the whale did it once an
hour, so that we told time by the openings—about the
second opening, as I said, much shouting and commotion suddenly made itself heard, and what seemed
to be commands and oar-beats.
<note n="1">Compare the description of the sea-fight between Corinth
and Corcyra in Thucydides 1. 48.</note>
Excitedly we crept
up to the very mouth of the animal, and standing



<pb n="299"/>

inside the teeth we saw the most unparallelled of all
the sights that ever I saw—huge men, fully half
a furlong in stature, sailing on huge islands as
on galleys. Though I know that what I am going
to recount savours of the incredible, I shall say
it nevertheless. There were islands, long but not
very high, and fully a hundred. furlongs in circumference, on each of which about a hundred and
twenty of those men were cruising, some of whom,
sitting along each side of the island one behind the
other, were rowing with huge cypress trees for oars—
branches, leaves and all!
<note n="1">Herodotus (2, 156) speaks of a floating island in Egypt.</note>
Aft at the stern, as I
suppose you would call it, stood the master on a high
hill, holding a bronze tiller five furlongs in length.
At the bow, about forty of them under arms were
fighting ; they were like men in all but their hair,
which was fire and blazed up, so that they had no
need of plumes.
<note n="2">Cf. Il. 5,4; ‘ And tireless flames did burn on crest and
shield.”</note>  In lieu of sails, the wind struck the
forest, which was dense on each of the islands, filled
this and carried the island wherever the helmsman
would. There were boatswains in command, to keep
the oarsmen in time, and the islands moved swiftly
under the rowing, like war-galleys.
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="39"><p>

At first we only saw two or three, but later on
about six hundred made their appearance. Taking
sides, they went to war and had a sea-fight. Many
collided with one another bows on, and miany



<pb n="301"/>

were rammed amidships and sunk. Some, grappling one another, put up a stout fight and were
slow to cast off, for those stationed at the bows
showed all zeal in boarding and slaying: no
quarter was given. Instead of iron grapnels they
threw aboard one another great devilfish with lines
belayed to them, and these gripped the woods and
held the island fast. They struck and wounded one
another with oysters that would fill a wagon and
with hundred-foot sponges.

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="40"><p>

The leader of one
side was Aeolocentaur, of the other, Brinedrinker.
Their battle evidently came about on account of an
act of piracy: Brinedrinker was said to have driven
off many herds of dolphins belonging to Aeolocentaur.
We knew this because we could hear them abusing
one another and calling out the names of their kings.
Finally the side of Aeolocentaur won; they sank
about a hundred and fifty of the enemy’s islands;
and took three more, crews and all; the rest backed
water and fled. After pursuing them some distance,
they turned back to the wrecks at evening, making
prizes of most of them and picking up what belonged to
themselves; for on their own side not less than eighty
islands had gone down. They also made a trophy of
the isle-fight by setting up one of the enemy’s
islands on the head of the whale. That night they
slept on shipboard around the animal, making their:
shore lines fast to him and riding at anchor just off
him ; for they had anchors, large and strong, made
of glass.
<note n="1">Very likely a punning reference to some traveller’s
account of wooden (ξυλίναις) anchors.</note>
On the following day they performed



<pb n="303"/>

sacrifice on the whale, buried their. friends on
him, and sailed off rejoicing and apparently singing
hymns of victory. So much for the events of the
isle-fight.
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="1">
<p>
From that time on, as I could no longer endure
the life in the whale and was discontented with the
delay, I sought a way of escape. First we determined to dig through the right side and make off,
and we made a beginning and tried to cut through.
-But when we had advanced some five furlongs without getting anywhere, we left off digging and decided to set the forest afire, thinking that in this way
the whale could be killed, and in that case our escape
would be easy. So we began at the tail end and set it
afire. For seven days and seven nights he was unaffected by the burning, but on the eighth and ninth
we gathered that he was in a bad way. For instance,
he yawned less frequently, and whenever he did
yawn he closed his mouth quickly. On the tenth
and eleventh day mortification at last set in and
he was noisome. On the twelfth we perceived just .
in time that if someone did not shore his jaws open
when he yawned, so that he could not close them
again, we stood a chance of being shut up in the
dead whale and dying there ourselves. At the last
moment, then, we propped the mouth open with
great beams and made our boat ready, putting aboard


<pb n="305"/>

all the water we could and the other provisions.
Our sailing-master was to be Scintharus.

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="2"><p>

On the next day the whale was dead at last.
We dragged the boat up, took her through the gaps,
made her fast to the teeth and lowered her slowly
into the sea. Climbing on the back and sacrificing
to Poseidon there by the trophy, we camped for
three days, as it was calm. On the fourth day we
sailed off, and in so doing met and grounded on many
of the dead from the sea-fight, and measured their
bodies with amazement. For some days we sailed with
a moderate breeze, and then a strong norther blew up
and brought on great cold. The entire sea was frozen
by it, not just on the surface but to a depth of fully
six fathoms, so that we could leave the boat and run
on the ice. The wind held and we could not stand
it, so we devised an odd remedy—the proposer of the
idea was Scintharus. We dug a very large cave in
the water and stopped in it for thirty days, keeping
a fire burning and eating the fish that we found in
digging. When our provisions at last failed, we came
out, hauled up the boat, which had frozen in, spread
our canvas and slid, gliding on the ice smoothly and
easily, just as if we were sailing. On the fifth day
it was warm again, the ice broke up and everything
turned to water once more.
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="3"><p>
After sailing about three hundred furlongs we


<pb n="307"/>

ran in at a small desert island, where we got water—
which had failed by this time—and shot two wild
bulls, and then sailed away. These bulls did not
have their horns on their head but under their eyes,
as Momus wanted.<note n="1">Momus suggested this in order that the animal might see
what he was doing with his horns.</note> Not long afterwards we entered
a sea of milk, not of water, and in it a white island,
full of grapevines, came in sight. The island was
a great solid cheese, as we afterwards learned by
tasting it. Itwastwenty-five furlongsin circumference.
The vines were full of grapes, but the liquid which
we squeezed from them and drank was milk instead
of wine. A temple had been constructed in the
middle of the island in honour of Galatea the .
Nereid, as its inscription indicated. All the time
that we stopped in the island the earth was our
bread and meat and the milk from the grapes our
drink. Theruler of that region was said to be Tyro,
daughter of Salmoneus, who after departure from
home received this guerdon from Poseidon.
<note n="2">As gala is milk and tyros cheese, the goddess and the
queen of the island are fitly chosen.</note>

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="4"><p>
After stopping five days on the island we started
out on the sixth, with a bit of breeze propelling
us over a rippling sea. On the eighth day, by which
time we were no longer sailing through the milk
but in briny blue water, we came in sight of many men
running .over the sea, like us in every way, both in
shape and in size, except only their feet, which were
of cork: that is why they were called Corkfeet, if I




<pb n="309"/>

am not mistaken. We were amazed to see that they
did not go under, but stayed on the top of the waves
and went about fearlessly. Some of them came up
and greeted: us in the Greek language; they said
that they were on their way to Cork, their native
city. For some distance they travelled with us,
running alongside, and then they turned off and
went their way, wishing us luck on our voyage.

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="5"><p>
In a little while many islands came in sight.
Near us, to port, was Cork, where the men were
going, a city built on a great round cork. Ata
distance and more to starboard were five islands,
very large and high, from which much fire was
blazing up. Dead ahead was one that was. flat
and low-lying, not less than five hundred furlongs
off. When at length we were near it, a wonderful
breeze blew about us, sweet and fragrant, like the
one that, on the word of the historian Herodotus,<note>3, 113.</note>
breathes perfume from Araby the blest. The sweetness that met us was as if it came from roses and
narcissi and hyacinths and lilies and violets, from
myrrh and laurel and vines in bloom. Delighted with
the fragrance and cherishing high hopes after our long
toils, we gradually drew near to the island at last.
Then we saw many harbours all about it, large and
unfretted by beating waves; transparent rivers emptying softly into the sea; meads, too, and woods and
songbirds, some of them singing on the shore and
many in the branches. A rare, pure atmosphere
enfolded the place, and sweet breezes with their



<pb n="311"/>

blowing stirred the woods gently, so that from the
moving branches came a whisper of delightful,
unbroken music, like the fluting of Pandean pipes in
desert places. Moreover, a confused sound could be
heard incessantly, which was not noisy but resembled
that made at a drinking-party, when some are
playing, others singing and others beating time to
the flute or the lyre.

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="6"><p>

Enchanted with all this,
we put in, anchored our boat and landed, leaving
Scintharus and two of my comrades on board.
Advancing through a flowery mead, we came upon
the guards and sentinels, who bound us with rosy
wreaths—the strongest fetter that they have—and
led us inland to their ruler. They told us on the
way that the island was the one that is called the
“Isle of the Blest, and that the ruler was the Cretan
Rhadamanthus. On being brought before him, we
were given fourth place among the people awaiting
trial.

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="7"><p>

The first case was that of Ajax,son of Telamon,
to decide whether he should be allowed to associate
with the heroes or not: he was accused of having
gone mad and killed himself. At last, when much
had been said, Rhadamanthus gave judgment that
for the present he should be given in charge of Hippocrates, the Coan physician, to take the hellebore
treatment,<note n="1">A remedy for madness; Hor. Sat. 2. 3. 82.</note> and that later on, when he had recovered
his wits, he should have a place at the table of
the heroes.

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="8"><p>The second case was a love-affair—Theseus and Menelaus at law over Helen, to
determine which of the two she should live with.
Rhadamanthus pronounced that she should live with
Menelaus, because he had undergone so much toil,
and danger on account of his marriage: then too,



<pb n="313"/>

Theseus had other wives, the. Amazon<note n="1">Hippolyta.</note>
and the
daughters of Minos.<note n="2">Ariadne and Phaedra.</note>

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="9"><p>

The third judgment was given
in a matter of precedence between Alexander,
son of Philip, and Hannibal of Carthage, and the
decision was that Alexander outranked Hannibal,
so his chair was placed next the elder Cyrus of
Persia.
<note n="3">Cf. Dialogues of the Dead, 25.</note>

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="10"><p>

We were brought up fourth; and he asked
us how it was that we trod on holy ground while still
alive, and we told him the whole story. Then he
had us removed, pondered for a long time, and
consulted with his associates about us, Among
many other associates he had Aristides the Just, of
Athens. When he had come to a conclusion,
sentence was given that for being inquisitive and
not staying at home we should be tried after death,
but that for the present we might stop a definite
time in the island and share the life of the heroes,
and then we must be off. They set the length of our
stay at not more than seven months.

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="11"><p>

Thereupon our garlands fell away of themselves,
and we were set free and taken into the city
and to the table of the blessed. The city itself is
all of gold and the wall around it of emerald.
<note n="4">Lucian’s city is not necessarily a paredy on the New
Jerusalem, though the scholiast so understood it.</note> It
has seven gates, all of single planks of cinnamon.
The foundations of the city and the ground within
its walls are ivory. There are temples of all the
gods, built of beryl, and in them great monolithic
altars of amethyst, on which they make their great






<pb n="315"/>

burnt-offerings. Around the city runs a river of
the finest myrrh, a hundred royal cubits wide and
five deep, so that one can swim in it comfortably.
For baths they have large houses of glass, warmed
by burning cinnamon ; instead of water there is hot
dew in the tubs.

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="12"><p>

For clothing they use delicate
purple spider-webs. As for themselves, they have
no bodies, but are intangible and fleshless, with only
shape and figure. Incorporeal as they are, they
nevertheless live and move and think and talk. In
a word, it would appear that their naked souls go
about in the semblance of their bodies. Really, if
one did not touch them, he could not tell that what
he saw was not a body, for they are like upright
shadows, only not black. Nobody grows old, but
stays the same age as on coming there. Again, it is
neither night among them nor yet very bright day,
but the light which is on the country is. like the
gray morning toward dawn, when the sun has not
yet risen. Moreover, they are acquainted with only
one season of the year, for it is always spring there
and the only wind that blows there is Zephyr.

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="13"><p>

The country abounds in flowers and plants of all
kinds, -cultivated and otherwise.
<note n="1">Lucian makes a villainous pun here, contrasting hemeros (cultivated) with skieros (fond of darkness), as if the former
word meant-‘fond of daylight.’ (hemera)!</note> The grape-vines
yield twelve vintages a year, bearing every month;
the pomegranates, apples and other fruit-trees were
said to bear thirteen times a year, for in one month,
their Minoan, they bear twice. Instead of wheat-ears,
loaves of bread all baked grow on the tops of the



<pb n="317"/>

halms, so that they Jook like mushrooms. In the
neighbourhood of the city there are three handed
and sixty-five springs of water, as many of honey,
five hundred of myrrh—much smaller, however—seven rivers of milk and eight of wine.

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="14"><p>
Their table is spread outside. the city in the Elysian
Fields, a very beautiful mead with thick woods of
all sorts round about it, overshadowing the feasters.
The couches they lie on are made of flowers, and they
are attended and served by the winds, who, however,
do not pour out their wine, for they do not need anyone to do this. There are great trees of the clearest
glass around the table, and instead of fruit they bear
cups of all shapes and sizes. When anyone comes to
table he picks one or two of the cups and puts them
at his place. These fill with wine at once, and
that is the way they get their drink. Instead of
garlands, the nightingales and the other song-birds
gather flowers in their bills from the fields hard by
and drop them down like snow, flying overhead and
singing. Furthermore, the way they are scented is
that thick clouds draw up myrrh from the springs
and the river, stand over the table and under the
gentle manipulation of the. winds rain down a
delicate dew.

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="15"><p>

At the board they pass their time
with poetry and song. For the most part they
sing the epics of Homer, who is there himself and
shares the revelry, lying at table in the place above
Odysseus. Their choruses are of boys and gnris, fed


<pb n="319"/>

and accompanied by Eunomus of Locris, Arion of
Lesbos, Anacreon and Stesichorus. There can be
no doubt about the latter, for I saw him there—by
that time Helen had forgiven him.
<note n="1">Stesichorus had said harsh words of Helen, and was
blinded by Castor and Pollux for his presumption. He
recanted in a famous Palinode, of which some lines are still
preserved (Plato, Phaedrus, 243), and so recovered his eyesight.</note> When they
stop singing another chorus appears, composed of
swans and swallows and nightingales, and as they
sing the whole wood renders the accompaniment,
with the winds leading.
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="16"><p>

But the greatest thing
that they have for ensuring a good time is that
two springs are by the table, one of laughter and
the other of enjoyment. They all drink from each
of these when the revels begin, and thenceforth enjoy
themselves and laugh all the while.

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="17"><p>

But I desire to mention the famous men whom
I saw there. There were all the demigods and
the veterans of Troy except Locrian Ajax, the only
one, they said, who was being punished in the
place of the wicked. Of the barbarians there were
both Cyruses, the Scythian Anacharsis, the Thracian
Zamolxis and Numa the Italian. In addition, there
were Lycurgus of Sparta, Phocion and Tellus of
Athens and the wise men, all but Periander. I
also saw Socrates, the son of Sophroniscus, chopping
logic with Nestor and Palamedes; about him were
Hyacinthus of Sparta, Narcissus of Thespiae, Hylas
and other handsome lads. It seemed to me that
Hyacinthus was his especial favourite, for at any rate
he refuted himi most. It was said that Rhadamanthus



<pb n="321"/>

was angry at Socrates and had often threatened to
banish him from the island if he kept up his nonsense
and would not quit his irony and be merry. Plato
alone was not there: it was said that he was living in
his imaginary city under the constitution and the laws
that he himself wrote.

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="18"><p>

The followers of Aristippus and
Epicurus were in the highest favour among the heroes
because they are pleasant and agreeable and jolly
good fellows, Aesop the Phrygian was also there— —
they have him for a jester. Diogenes the Cynic had so
changed his ways that he not only married Lais the
courtesan, but often got up and danced and indulged
in tomfoolery when he had had too much. None of
the Stoics was there—they were said to be still on
the way up the steep hill of virtue. With regard to
Chrysippus, we heard tell that he is not permitted
to set foot on the island until he submits himself to
the hellebore treatment for the fourth time.
<note n="1">See the Philosophers for Sale for another jest at Chrysippus’ insanity.</note>
They
said that the Academicians wanted to come but were
still holding off and debating, for they could not
arrive at a conclusion even on the question whether
such an island existed. Then too-I suppose they
feared to have Rhadamanthus judge them, as they
themselves had abolished standards of judgment.
It was said, however, that many of them had started
to follow people coming thither, but fell behind
through their slowness, being constitutionally unable
to arrive at anything, and so turned back half-way.
These were the most conspicuous of those present.

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="19"><p>

They render especial honours to Achilles and after
him to Theseus. About love-making their attitude



<pb n="323"/>

is such that they bill-and-coo openly, in plain sight
of everyone, without any discrimination, and think
no shame of it at all. Socrates, the only exception,
used to protest that he was above suspicion in
his relations with young persons, but everyone held
him guilty of perjury. In fact, Hyacinthus and
Narcissus often said that they knew better, but he
persisted in his denial. They all have their wives in
common and nobody is jealous of his neighbour ; in
this point they out-Plato Plato. Complaisance is the
universal rule.
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="20"><p>
Hardly two or three days had passed before I
went up to Homer the poet when we were both at
leisure, and questioned him about everything.
“Above all,” said I, “where do you come from?
This point in particular is being investigated even
yet at home.” “Iam not unaware,” said he, “that
some think me a Chian, some a Smyrniote and many
a Colophonian. As a matter of fact, I am a Babylonian, and among my fellow-countrymen my name
was not Homer but Tigranes. Later on, when I was
a hostage ‘(homeros) among the Greeks, I changed my
name.” I went on to enquire whether the
bracketed lines had been written by him, and he
asserted that they were all his own: consequently I
held the grammarians Zenodotus and Aristarchus
guilty of pedantry in the highest degree. Since
he had answered satisfactorily on these points, I
next asked him why he began with the wrath of
Achilles; and he said that it just came into his
head that way, without any study. Moreover, I
wanted to know whether he wrote the Odyssey
before the Iliad, as most people say: he said no.
<pb n="325"/>

That he was not blind, as they say, I understood at
once—I saw it,and so had no need toask. Often again
at other times I would do this when I saw him at
leisure ; I would go and make enquiries of him and he
would give me a cordial answer to everything, particularly after the lawsuit that he won, for a charge of libel
had been brought against him by Thersites because
of the way he had ridiculed him in the poem, and
the case was won by Homer, with Odysseus for his
lawyer.

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="21"><p>


At about this time arrived Pythagoras of Samos
who had undergone seven transformations, had
lived in seven bodies and had now ended the migrations of his soul. All his right side was of gold.
Judgment was pronounced that he should become a
member of their community, but when I left
the point was still at issue whether he ought to be
called Pythagoras or Euphorbus. Empedocles came
too, all burned and his body completely cooked,
<note n="1">From his leap into the crater of Aetna,</note> but
he was not received in spite of his many entreaties.

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="22"><p>
As time went on their games came round, the
Games of the Dead. The referees were Achilles,
serving for the fifth time, and Theseus for the
seventh. The full details would make a long story,
but I shall tell the principal things that they did.
In wrestling the winner was Caranus, the descendant
of Heracles, who defeated Odysseus for the championship. The boxing was a draw between Areius
the Egyptian, who is buried at Corinth, and Epeius.
For combined boxing and wrestling they offer no



<pb n="327"/>

prizes. In the foot-race I do not remember who
won and in poetry, Homer was really far the best
man, but Hesiod won. The prize in each case was
a crown that was plaited of peacock feathers.

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="23"><p>
Hardly had the games been concluded when
word came that those who were under punishment
in the place of the wicked had burst their bonds, had
overpowered their guard, and were advancing on the
island: that théy were under the leadership of
Phalaris of Acragas, Busiris the Egyptian, Diomed of
Thrace, and Sciron and Pityocamptes. When Rhadamanthus heard of this he mustered the heroes on the
shore. They were led by Theseus, Achilles and Ajax,
the son of Telamon, who by this time had recovered
his wits. They engaged and fought, and the heroes
won. Achilles contributed most to their success, but
Socrates, who was stationed on the right wing, was
brave, too—far more so than when’ he fought at -
Delium in his lifetime. When four of the enemy
came at him he did not run away or change countenance. For this they afterwards gave him a special
reward, a beautiful great park in the suburbs,
where he used to gather his comrades and dispute :
he named the place the Academy of the Dead.

Arresting the losers and putting them in irons,
they sent them off to be punished still more severely
than before. An account of this battle was written
by Homer, and as I was leaving he gave me the
book to take to the people at home, but later I lost
it along with everything else. The poem began:

But to return—they cooked beans,<note n="1">An allusion to the Pyanepsia, the Athenian Beanfeast.</note>
as is their
custom when they are successful at war, hdd a feast
in honour of the victory and made a great holiday.
Pythagoras was the only one who did not take part
in it; he sat by himself and went dinnerless
because he detested beans.

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="25"><p>
Six months had passed and it was about the
middle of the seventh when sedition arose. Cinyras,
the son of Scintharus, a tall and handsome lad, had
long been in love with Helen, and it was no secret
that she herself was madly enamoured of the boy. For
instance, they often winked to one another at table,
drank to each other and got up together and
wandered about the wood. Well, one fine day
through love and despair Cinyras determined to rape
Helen—she agreed to it—and go to one of the
islands in the offing, either Cork or Cheesie. As
accomplices they had long ago taken on three of the
most reckless of my comrades; but Cinyras did not
inform his father, for he knew that he would not let
him do it. When they had come to a decision, they
carried out their stratagem. It was at nightfall, and
I was not on hand, as I chanced to be taking a nap
under the table. Without the knowledge of the
rest they carried Helen off and put to sea in haste.

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="26"><p>

About midnight, when Menelaus woke up, and
found that his wife was not in bed, he made a
great stir and took his brother and went to King
Rhadamanthus. But as day began to break the
lookouts said that they saw the ship far out at sea.
Then Rhadamanthus put fifty of the heroes aboard a



<pb n="331"/>

ship made of a single log of asphodel and ordered
them to give chase. Rowing with a will, they overtook them about noon, just as they were entering
the milky place in the ocean near Cheesie—that is
all they lacked of escaping! Securing the ship with
a hawser of roses, they sailed home. -Helen cried
and hid her head for shame. As to Cinyras and the
rest, first Rhadamanthus asked them if they had any
other accomplices, and they said no; then he. had
them secured by the offending member and sent
them away to the place of the wicked, after they
had been first scourged with mallow.

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="27"><p>

The heroes
voted, too, that we be dismissed from the island
before our time was up, remaining only till the next
day.</p>

<p>
Thereupon I began to cry aloud and weep because
I had to leave such blessings behind me and resume
my wanderings. But they cheered me up, saying
that before many years I should come back to them
again, and they even pointed out to me my future
chair and couch, close to the best people. I went
to Rhadamanthus and earnestly besought him to tell
me what would happen and indicate my course. He
said that I should reach my native land in spite of
many wanderings and dangers, but refused to tell the
time of my return. However, pointing out the islands
near by—there were five in sight and a sixth in the
distance—, “These,” said he, “are the Isles of
the Wicked, here close at hand, from which you see
all the smoke arising: the sixth yonder is the City
of Dreams. Next comes the island of Calypso, but


<pb n="333"/>

you cannot see it yet. When you have sailed by
these, you will finally come to the great continent
opposite the one which your people inhabit. Then
at last, after you have had many adventures and
have travelled through all sorts of countries and lived
among unfriendly men, in course of time you will
reach the other continent.”

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="28"><p>
With these words he plucked a root of mallow
from the ground and handed it to me, telling me to
pray to it in my greatest straits. And he advised me
if ever I reached this country, neither to stir the fire
with a sword-blade nor to eat lupines nor to make
love to anyone over eighteen,
<note n="1">The first is a real Pythagorean precept, or what passed
for such (Plut. Mor, 128) ; the other two are parodies.</note> saying that if I bore
these points in mind I might have good hopes of
getting back to the island.
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="29"><p>
Well, I made preparations for the voyage, and
when the time came, joined them at the feast. On
the next day I went to the poet Homer and begged
him to compose me a couplet to carve up, and when
he had done so, I set up a slab of beryl near the
harbour and had the couplet carved-onit. It was:

<l>One Lucian, whom the blessed gods befriend,</l>
<l>Beheld what’s here, and home again did wend.</l>

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="30"><p>

I stayed that day, too, and put to sea on the
next, escorted by the heroes. At that juncture
Odysseus came to me without ‘the knowledge of
Penelope and gave me a letter to carry to Ogygia
Island, to Calypso. Rhadamanthus sent the pilot
Nauplius with me, so that if we touched at the



<pb n="335"/>

islands no one might arrest us, thinking we were
putting in on another errand.</p>

<p>Forging ahead, we had passed out of the fragrant
atmosphere when of a sudden a terrible odour
greeted us as of asphalt, sulphur, and pitch burning
together, and a vile, insufferable stench as of roasting
human flesh: the atmosphere was murky and foggy,
and a pitchy dew distilled from it. Likewise we
heard the noise of scourge$ and the wailing of many
men.
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="31"><p>

The other islands’ we did not touch at,
but the one on which we landed was precipitous and
sheer on all sides ; it was roughened with rocks and
stony places, and there was neither tree nor water in
it. We crawled up the cliffs, however, and went
ahead in a path full of thorns and calthrops, finding
the country very ugly. On coming to the enclosure
and the place of punishment, first of all we wondered
at the nature of the region. The ground itself was
all sown with sword blades and calthrops, and around
it flowed three rivers, one of mud, the second of blood
and the inmost one of fire. The latter was very
large, and impossible to cross: it ran like water and
undulated like the sea, and it contained many fish,
some similar to torches, and some, a smaller variety,
to live coals. They called them candlefish.

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="32"><p>

There was a single narrow way leading in, past all
the rivers, and the warder set there was Timon ot
Athens. We got through, however, and with
Nauplius for our conductor we saw many kings
undergoing punishment, and many commoners too.
Some of them we even recognized, and we saw Cinyras


<pb n="337"/>

triced up as aforesaid in the smoke of a slow fire.,
The guides told the life of each, and the crimes for
which they were being punished ; and the severest
punishment of all fell to those who told lies while
in life and those who had written what was not true,
among whom were Ctesias of Cnidos, Herodotus and
many more. On seeing them, I had good hopes for
the future, for I have never told a lie that I know
of.

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="33"><p>

Well, I turned back to the ship quickly, for
I could not endure the sight, said good-bye to
Nauplius, and sailed away.</p>

<p>
After a short time the Isle of Dreams came
in sight close by, faint and uncertain to the eye. It
had itself some likeness to a dream, for as we
approached it receded and retired and retreated
to a greater distance. Overtaking it at length and
sailing into the harbour called Sleep, we landed near
the ivory gates, where the sanctuary of the Cock is,
about dusk, and on entering the city, we saw many
dreams of all sorts. But first I desire to speak of the
city itself, since no one else has written about it, and
Homer, the only one to mention it at all, was not
quite accurate in what he said.
<note n="1">Odyss. 19, 560 ff.</note>

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="34"><p>

On all sides of
it is a wood, in which the trees are tall poppies and
mandragoras, and they have a great number of bats
in them; for there is no other winged thing in the
island. A river flows near which they call Sleepwalker, and there are two springs by the gates,



<pb n="339"/>

named Soundly and Eight-hours. The wall of the
city is high and parti-coloured, very like a rainbow
in tint. The gates in it are not two, as Homer says,
but four. Two face Slowcoach Plain, one of which
is of iron and the other of earthenware; through
these, it is said, the fearful, murderous, revolting
dreams go out. The other two face the harbour
and the sea, one of which is of horn and the other,
through which we came in, of ivory. As one enters
the city, on the right is the temple of Night, for
the gods they worship most are Night and the Cock,
whose sanctuary is built near the harbour. On the left
is the palace of Sleep, who rules among them and has
appointed two satraps or lieutenants, Nightmare, son
of Causeless, and Rich, son of Fancy. In the centre
of the square is a spring which they call Drowsimere,
and close to it are two temples, that of Falsehood
and that of Truth. There too is their holy of holies
and their oracle, which Antiphon, the interpreter ot
dreams, presided over as prophet, having had this
office from Sleep.

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="35"><p>

As to the dreams themselves,
they differ from one another both in nature and in
looks. Some were tall, handsome and well-proportioned, while others were small and ugly; and
some were rich, I thought, while others were
humble and beggarly. There were winged and
portentous dreams among them, and there were
others dressed up as if for a carnival, being clothed to
represent kings and gods and different characters of
the sort. We actually recognised many of them,
whom we had seen long ago at home. These came


<pb n="341"/>

up to us and greeted us like old acquaintances, took
us with them, put us to sleep and entertained us
very splendidly and hospitably. They treated us
like lords in every way, and even promised to make
us kings and nabobs, A few of them actually took
us off home, gave us a sight of our friends and
families and brought us back the same day.

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="36"><p>

For
thirty days and thirty nights we stopped with them
and had a fine time—sleeping! Then of a ‘sudden a
great thunder-clap came; we woke up, sprang out of
bed and put to sea as soon as we had laid in
supplies.</p>

<p>On the third day out from there we touched at
the island of Ogygia and landed. But first 1 opened
the letter and read what was in it. It was:</p>

<p>Odysseus to Calypso, greeting.</p>
<p>“Soon after I built the raft and sailed away from
you I was shipwrecked, and with the help of Leucothea
managed to reach the land of the Phaeacians in
safety. They sent me home, and there I found that
my wife had a number of suitors who were living on
the fat of the land at our house. I killed them all,
and was afterwards slain by Telegonus, my son by
Circe. Now I am on the Isle of the Blest, thoroughly
sorry to have given up my life with you and the
immortality which you offered me. Therefore, if I
get a chance, I shall run away and come to you.”
In addition to this, the letter said. that she was to
entertain us.
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="37"><p>

On going a short way from the
sea I found the cave, which was as Homer described
it,
<note n="1">Odyss. 5, 55 ff.</note>
and found Calypso herself working wool. When



<pb n="343"/>

she had taken the letter and read it, she wept a long
time at first, and then she asked us in to enjoy her hospitality, gave us a splendid feast and enquired about
Odysseus and Penelope—how she looked and
whether she was prudent, as Odysseus used to boast
in old times.
<note n="1">Odyss. 5, 201 ff.</note> We made her such answers as we
thought would please her.</p>
<p>
After that, we went back to the ship and slept
beside it on the shore.
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="38"><p>
Early in the morning
we put to sea in a rising wind. We were stormtossed for two days, and on the third we fell in with
the Pumpkin-pirates. They are savages from the
neighbouring islands who prey on passing sailors.
They have large boats.of pumpkin, sixty cubits long ;
for after drying a pumpkin they hollow it out, take
out the insides and go sailing in it, using reeds for
masts and a pumpkin-leaf for a sail. They attacked
us with two crews and gave us battle, wounding
many of us by hitting us with pumpkin-seeds instead
of stones. After fighting for a long time on even
terms, about noon we-saw the Nut-sailors coming up
astern of the Pumpkin-pirates. They were enemies
to one another, as they showed by their actions ; for
when the Pumpkin-pirates noticed them coming up,
they neglected us and faced about and fought with
them. But in the meantime we hoisted our canvas
and fled, leaving them fighting.

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="39"><p>
It was evident that
the Nut-sailors would win, as they were in greater



<pb n="345"/>

numbers—they had five crews—and fought from
stouter ships. Their boats were the halves of empty
nutshells, each of which measured fifteen fathoms in
length.
When we had lost them from sight, we attended
to the wounded, and thereafter we kept under arms
most of the time, always looking for attacks. And we
did not look in vain.

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="40"><p>

In fact, the sun had not yet
gone down when from a desert island there came out
against us about twenty men riding on huge dolphins,
who were pirates like the others. The dolphins
carried them securely and plunged and neighed like
horses. When they were close by, they separated
and threw at us from both sides with dry cuttle-fish
and crabs’ eyes. But when we let fly at them with
spears and arrows, they could not hold their ground,
but fled to the island, most of them wounded.

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="41"><p>
About midnight, while it was calm, we unexpectedly ran aground on an enormous kingfisher’s
nest; really, it was sixty furlongs in circumference.
The female was sailing on it, keeping her eggs
warm, and she was not much smaller than the
nest—in fact, as she started up she almost sunk the
ship with the wind of her wings. She flew off, however, uttering a plaintive cry. We landed when day
began to break, and observed that the nest was like
a great raft, built of huge trees. There were five
hundred eggs in it, every one of them bigger than a
Chian wine-jar, and the chicks were already visible
inside them and were chirping. We cut open one


<pb n="347"/>

of the eggs with axes and took from the shell a
featherless chick fatter than twenty vultures.

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="42"><p>

When we had sailed a distance of two hundred
furlongs from the nest, great and wonderful signs
manifested themselves to us. The gooseneck
<note n="1">In ancient ships the gooseneck was an ornament on the
stem, or (as here) on the stern, Nowadays it is a device for
fastening a spar to a mast.</note>
suddenly grew feathers and started cackling, the sailingmaster, Scintharus, who was already bald, became
the owner of long hair, and what was strangest of all,
the ship’s mast budded, branched, and bore fruit at
the summit! The fruit consisted of figs and black
raisin-grapes, which were not yet ripe.
<note n="2">A parody on the experience of the Pirates who carried
off Dionysus (Hymn. Hom. 7, 38).</note>
On seeing
this, we were disturbed, as well we might be, and
offered a prayer to the gods on account of the
strangeness of the manifestation.

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="43"><p>

We had not
yet gone five hundred’ furlongs when we saw a very
large, thick forest of pines and cypresses. We
thought it was land, but in reality it was a
bottomless sea overgrown with rootless trees, in spite
of which the trees stood up motionless and straight,
as if they were floating. On drawing near and
forming an idea of the situation, we were in a
quandary what to do, for it was not possible to sail
between the trees, they being thick and close
together, nor did. it seem easy to turn back.
Climbing the tallest tree, I looked to see how things
were on the other side, and I saw that the forest
extended for fifty stades or a little more, and that
another ocean lay beyond. So we resolved to lift the




<pb n="349"/>

ship on to the tree-tops, which were thick, and cross
over, if we could, to the farther side ; and that is what
we did. We made her fast:to a large rope, climbed
" the trees and pulled her up with much ado. Setting
her on the branches and spreading our canvas, we
sailed just as if we were at sea, carried along by the
force of the wind. At that juncture a line of the
poet Antimachus came into my head; he says somewhere or other:

<quote>
<l>And unto them their forest cruise pursuing.</l>
</quote>

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="44"><p>

We managed the wood in spite of everything
and reached the water. Lowering the ship again
in the same way we sailed through pure, clear
water, until we came to a great crevasse made by
the water dividing, like the cracks that one often
sees in the earth, made by earthquakes. Though
we got in the sails, the ship was slow to lose headway and so came near being engulfed. Peering over
the edge, we saw a precipice of fully a thousand
furlongs, most frightful and unnatural—the water
stood there as if cut apart! But as we looked about
us we saw on the right at no great distance a bridge
thrown across, which was of: water, joining the
surfaces of the two seas and flowing from one to the
other. Rowing up, therefore, we ran into the stream
and by great effort got across, though we thought
we should never do it.

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="45"><p>

Then we came to a smooth sea and an island
of no great size that was easily accessible and was
inhabited. -It was peopled by savages, the Bullheads, who have horns in the style that the


<pb n="351"/>

Minotaur is represented at home. Landing, we
went up country to get water and food if we could,
for we no longer had any. Water we found close
by, but there was nothing else to be seen, though
we heard a great bellowing not far off. Thinking it
was a herd of cattle, we went ahead cautiously and
came upon the men of whom I spoke. On seeing
us, they gave chase, and captured three of my
comrades, but the rest of us made our escape to
the sea. Then, however, we all armed ourselves—
it did not seem right to let our friends go unavenged
—and fell on the Bullheads while they were portioning out the flesh of the men they had slain. We
put them all to flight and gave chase, killing about
fifty and taking two alive: then we turned back to
the ship with our prisoners. We found no food,
though. The rest therefore urged that the captives
be killed; I did not approve of this, however, but
put them in irons and kept them under guard until
ambassadors came from the Bullheads, asking for
them and offering a ransom. We understood them
because they made signs and bellowed plaintively as
if in entreaty. The ransom was a number of cheeses,
dried fish, onions, and four does, each of which had
only three feet, for while they had two behind, the
forefeet had grown together. In exchange for all
this we surrendered the captives, and after stopping
there a single day we put to sea.

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="46"><p>

Already we began to see fish, birds flew by and
all the other signs that land was near made their
appearance. In a little while we saw men who were


<pb n="353"/>

following a novel mode of sailing, being at once
sailors and ships. Let me tell you how they did it:
they lay on their backs on the water, hoisted
their jury-masts, which are sizeable, spread sail on
them, held the clews in their hands, and were off
and away as soon as the wind struck them. Others
came next who sat on corks and had a pair of
dolphins hitched up, driving them and guiding them
with reins ; in moving ahead, the dolphins drew the
corks along. They neither offered us harm nor ran
away from us, but drove along fearlessly and peacefully, wondering at the shape of our boat and
examining her from all sides.

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="47"><p>

In the evening we touched at another island of
no great size. It was inhabited by women—or so
we thought—who spoke Greek, and they came up
to us, welcomed and embraced us. They were got
up just like courtezans and were all beautiful and
young, with tunics that swept on the ground. The
island was called Witchery, and the city Watertown.
<note n="1">Both names are uncertain in the Greck.</note>
Each of the women took one of us home with her
and made him her guest. But I excused myself for
a moment—I had misgivings—and on looking about
rather carefully, saw many human bones and skulls
lying there. To make an outcry, call my comrades
together and arm ourselves did not seem best to. me,
but I fetched out my mallow and prayed to it
earnestly that I might escape the ills that beset me.
After a little while, as my hostess was waiting on me,
I saw that her legs were not a woman’s but those of
an ass. Then I drew my sword, caught and bound



<pb n="355"/>

her and questioned her about the whole thing.
Against her will she told me that they were women
of the sea, called Asslegs and that they fed on the
strangers that visited them. ‘“When we have made’
them drunk,” said she, “we go to bed with them
and attack them in their sleep.” On hearing this, I
left her there tied up, and myself went up to the
housetop and cried out and called my comrades together. When they had come, I told them everything, showed them the bones and led them in to the
woman who was tied up, but she immediately turned
to water and disappeared. Nevertheless [ thrust my
sword into the water as a test, and the water turned
to blood.

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="48"><p>

With all speed we went back to the ship and
sailed away. When the light of day began to show,
we saw land and judged it to be the world opposite
the one which we inhabit. After doing homage and
offering prayer, we took thought for the future.
Some of us proposed just to land and then turn back
again, others to leave the boat there, go into the
interior and see what the inhabitants were like.
While we were debating this, a violent storm struck
the boat, dashed it ashore and wrecked it, and
we ourselves had much trouble in swimming out
with our arms and anything else that we could
catch up.</p>

<p>
Thus far I have told you what happened to me
until I reached the other world, first at sea, then


<pb n="357"/>

during my voyage among the islands and in the air, then
in the whale, and after we left it, among the heroes
and the dreams, and finally among the Bullheads
and the Asslegs. What happened in the other world
I shall tell you in the succeeding books.

<head>SLANDER: ON NOT BEING QUICK TO PUT FAITH IN IT<note>This essay is rhetoric pure and simple, and was probably

<div type="textpart" subtype=" section" n="1"><p>


It is really a terrible thing, is ignorance, a cause
of many woes to humanity; for it envelops things
in a fog, so to speak, and obscures the truth and
overshadows each man’s life. Truly, we all resemble
people lost in the dark—nay, we are even like blind
men. Now we stumble inexcusably, now we lift our
feet when there is no need of it; and we do not see
what is near and right before us, but fear what is far
away and extremely remote as if it blocked our path.
In short, in everything we do we are always making
plenty of missteps. For this redson the writers of
tragedy have found in this universal truth many and
many a motive for their dramas—take for example,
the house of Labdacus,
<note n="1">King of Thebes, father of Laius.</note> the house of Pelops and their
like. Indeed, most of the troubles that.are put on
the stage are supplied to the poets, you will find, by
ignorance, as though it were a sort of tragic divinity.
What I have in mind more than anything else is
slanderous lying about acquaintances and friends,
through which families have been rooted out, cities
have utterly perished, fathers have been driven mad



<pb n="363"/>

against their children, brothers against own brothers,
children against their parents and lovers against
those they love. Many a friendship, too, has. been
parted and many an oath broken through belief in
slander.
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="2"><p>

In order, then, that we may as far as
possible avoid being involved in it, I wish to show in
words, as if in a painting, what sort of thing slander
is, how it begins and what it does.</p>

<p>I should say, however, that Apelles of Ephesus
long ago preempted this subject for a picture ; and
with good reason, for he himself had been slandered
to Ptolemy on the ground that he had taken part
with Theodotas in the conspiracy in Tyre, although
Apelles had never set eyes on Tyre and did not
know who Theodotas was, beyond having heard that
he was one of Ptolemy’s governors, in charge of affairs
in Phoenicia.
<note n="1">The story is apocryphal, as Apelles must have been in
his grave nearly a hundred years when Theodotus (not
Theodotas) betrayed Ptolemy Philopator (219 3.c.).</note>
Nevertheless, one of his rivals named
Antiphilus, through envy of his favour at court
and professional jealousy, maligned him by telling
Ptolemy that he had taken part in the whole enterprise, and that someone had seen him dining with
Theodotas in Phoenicia and whispering into his ear
all through the meal; and in the end he declared
that the revolt of Tyre and the capture of Pelusium
had taken place on the advice of Apelles.

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="3"><p>

Ptolemy, who in general was not particularly sound
of judgment, but had been brought up in the midst
of courtly flattery, was so inflamed and upset by this



<pb n="365"/>

surprising charge that he did not take into account
any of the probabilities, not considering either that
the accuser was a rival or that a painter was too
insignificant a person for so great a piece of treason—
a painter, too, who had been well treated by him
and honoured above any of his fellow-craftsmen.
Indeed, he did not even enquire whether Apelles
had gone to Tyre at all. On the contrary, he at
once began to rave and filled the palace with noise,
shouting “The ingrate,” “The plotter,’ and “The
conspirator.”’ And if one of his fellow-prisoners,
who was indignant at the impudence of-Antiphilus
and felt sorry for poor Apelles, had not said that the
man had not taken any part whatever in the affair,
he would have had his head cut off, and so would
have shared the consequences of the troubles in Tyre
without being himself to blame for them in any way.

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="4"><p>

Ptolemy is said to have been so ashamed of the
affair that he presented Apelles with a hundred
talents and gave him Antiphilus for his slave.
Apelles, for his part, mindful of the risk that he had
run, hit back at slander in a painting.

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="5"><p>

On the right
of it sits a man with very large ears, almost like
those of Midas, extending his hand to Slander while
she is still at some distance from him. Near him,
on one side, stand two women—Ignorance, I think,
and Suspicion. On the other side, Slander is coming
up, a woman beautiful beyond measure, but full of
passion and excitement, evincing as she does fury
and wrath by carrying in her left hand a blazing
torch and with the other dragging by the hair a
young man who stretches out his hands to heaven


<pb n="367"/>

and calls the gods to witness his innocence, She is ©
conducted by a pale ugly man who has a piercing
eye and looks as if he had wasted away in long illness; he may be supposed to be Envy. Besides,
there are two women in attendance on Slander,
egging her on, tiring her and tricking her out.
According to the interpretation of them given me
by the guide to the picture, one was Treachery and
the other Deceit. They were followed by a woman
dressed in deep mourning, with black clothes all in
tatters—Repentance, I think, her name was. At all
events, she was turning back with tears in her eyes
and casting a stealthy glance, full of shame, at
Truth, who was approaching.</p>
<p>That is the way in which Apelles represented in
the painting his own hairbreadth escape.

Come,
suppose we too, if you like, following the lead of the
Ephesian artist, portray the characteristics of slander,
after first sketching it in outline: for in that way
our picture will perhaps come out more clearly.
Slander, then, is a clandestine accusation, made without the cognizance of the accused and _ sustained
by the uncontradicted assertion of one side. This is
the subject of my lecture, and since there are three
leading characters in slander as in comedy—the
slanderér, the slandered person, and the hearer of
the slander,—let us consider what is ukely to happen
in the case of each of them.
<note n="1">This partition, derived from Herodotus (7, 10), is not at
all strictly followed by Lucian in developing his theme.</note>
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="7"><p>
In the first place, if you like, let us bring on the
star of the play, I mean the author of the slander.
That he is not a good man admits of no doubt, I am



<pb n="369"/>

sure, because no good man would make trouble for
his neighbour. On the contrary, it is characteristic
of good men to win renown and gain a reputation
for kind-heartedness by doing good to their friends,
not by accusing others wrongfully and getting them
hated.

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="8"><p>

Furthermore, that such a man is unjust, lawless,
impious and harmful to his associates is easy to see.
Who will not admit that fairness in everything and
unselfishness are due to justice, unfairness and:
selfishness to injustice? But when a man plies
slander in secret against people who are absent, is
he not selfish, inasmuch as he completely appropriates
his hearer by getting his ear first, stopping it up
and making it altogether impervious to the defence
because it has been previously filled with slander?
Such conduct is indeed the height of injustice, and
the best of the lawgivers, Solon and Draco, for
example, would say so, too; for they put the jurors
on oath to hear both sides alike and to divide
their goodwill equally between the litigants until
such time as the plea of the defendant, after
comparison with the other, shall disclose itself to be
better or worse. To pass judgment betore weighing
the defence against the complaint would, they
thought, be altogether impious and irreligious. In
truth, we may say that the very gods would be angry
if we should permit the plaintiff to say his say
unhampered, but should stop our ears to the defendant or silence him,<note n="1">The Greek is here corrupt. The translation merely
gives the probable sense of the passage.</note>

and then condemn him,



<pb n="371"/>

conquered by the'first plea. It may be said, then, that
slander does not accord with what is just and legal,
and what the jurors swear to do. But. if anybody
thinks that the lawgivers, who regommend that verdicts be so just and impartial, are not good authority,
I shall cite the best of poets in support of my contention. He makes a very admirable pronouncement
— indeed, lays down a law—on this point, saying :
<note n="1">Though this verse was frequently quoted in antiquity,
its authorship was unknown even then, and it was variously,
attributed to Phocylides, Hesiod, and Pittheus. See Bergk,
Poet. Lyr. Graec. ii, p. 93.</note>

<quote>
<l>Nor give your verdict ere both sides you hear.</l></quote>

He knew, I suppose, like everyone else, that though
there are many unjust things in the world, nothing
worse or more unjust can be found than for men to
have been condemned untried and unheard. But
this is just what the slanderer tries his best to
accomplish, exposing the slandered person untried
to the anger of the hearer and precluding defence by
the secrecy of his accusation.

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="9"><p>

Of course, all such men are also disingenuous and
cowardly ; they do nothing in the open, but shoot
from some hiding-place or, other, like soldiers in
ambush, so that it is impossible either to face them or
to fight them, but a man must let himself be slain in
helplessness and in ignorance of the character of the
war. And this is the surest proof that there is no
truth in the stories of slanderers; for if a man is
conscious that he is making a true charge, that man,
I take it, accuses the other in public, brings him to
book and pits himself against him in argument. No
soldier who can win in fair fight makes use of
ambushes and tricks against the enemy.



<pb n="373"/>


</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="10"><p>
For the most part, such men may be seen enjoying
high favour in the courts of kings and among the
friends of governors and princes, where envy is great,
suspicions are countless, and occasions for flattery and
slander are frequent. For where hope runs ever high,
there envy is more bitter, hate more dangerous, and
rivalry more cunning. All eye one another sharply
and keep watch like gladiators to detect some part
of the body exposed. Everyone, wishing to be first
himself, shoves or elbows his neighbour out of his
way and, if he can, slyly pulls down or trips up the
man ahead. In this way a good man is simply
upset and thrown at the start, and finally thrust off
the course in disgrace, while one who is better
versed in flattery and cleverer at such unfair
practices wins. In a word, it is “devil take the
hindmost !” ; for they quite confirm Homer’s saying:
<cit>
<quote>
<l>Impartial war adds slayer to the slain.</l></quote>
<bibl>Iliad 18, 309.</bibl></cit>

So, as their conflict is for no small stake, they think
out all sorts of ways to get at each other, of which
the quickest, though most perilous, road is slander,
which has a hopeful beginning in envy or hatred,
but leads to a sorry, tragic ending, beset with many
accidents.
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="11"><p>
Yet this is not an insignificant or a simple thing,
as one might suppose; it requires much skill, no
little shrewdness, and some degree of close study.

<pb n="375"/>

For slander would not do so much harm if it were
not set afoot in a plausible way, and it would not
prevail over truth, that is stronger than all else, if it
did not assume a high degree of attractiveness and
plausibility and a thousand things beside to disarm
its hearers.

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="12"><p>


Generally speaking, slander is most often directed
against a man who is in favour and on this account is
viewed with envy by those he has put behind him.
They all direct their shafts at him, regarding him as
a hindrance and a stumbling-block, and each one
expects to be first himself when he has routed his
chief and ousted him from favour. Something of
the same sort happens in the athletic games, in footraces. A good runner fram the moment that the
barrier falls
<note n="1">Races were started in antiquity by the dropping of a
rope or bar.</note>
thinks only of getting forward, sets
his mind on the finish and counts on his legs to
win for him; he therefore does not molest the man
next to him in any way or trouble himself at ail
about the contestants. But an inferior, unsportsmanlike competitor, abandoning all hope based on
his speed, resorts to crooked work, and the only
thing in the world he thinks of is cutting off the
runner by holding or tripping him, with the idea
that if he should fail in this he would never be able
to win. So it is with the friendships of the mighty.
The man in the lead is forthwith the object of plots,
and if caught off.his guard in the midst of his foes,
he is made away with, while-they are cherished and
are thought friendly because of the harm they
appeared to be doing to others.

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="13"><p>

As for the verisimilitude of their slander, calum-



<pb n="377"/>

niators are not careless in thinking out that point;
all their work centres on it, for they are afraid to
put in anything discordant or even irrelevant. For
example, they generally make their charges credible
by distorting the real attributes of the man they are
slandering. Thus they insinuate that a doctor is a
poisoner, that a rich man is a would-be monarch, or
that a courtier is a traitor.

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="14"><p>


Sometimes, however, the hearer himself suggests
the starting-point for slander, and the knaves attain
their end by adapting themselves to his disposition.
If they see that he is jealous, they say: “He signed
to your wife during dinner and gazed at her and
sighed, and Stratonice was not very displeased withhim.” In short, the charges they make to him are .
based on passion and illicit love. If he has a bent
for poetry and prides himself on it, they say : “No,
indeed! Philoxenus made fun of your verses, pulled
them to pieces and said that they wouldn’t scan and
were wretchedly composed.” Toa pious, godly man
the charge is made that his friend is godless and
impious, that he rejects God and denies Providence.
Thereupon the man, stung in the ear, so to speak,
by a gadfly, gets thoroughly angry, as is natural, and
turns his back on his friend without awaiting definite
proof.

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="15"><p>

In short, they think out and say the sort of
thing that they know to be best adapted to provoke
the hearer to anger, and as they know the place
where each can be wounded, they shoot their arrows
and throw their spears at it, so that their hearer,
thrown off his balance by sudden anger, will not
thereafter be free to get at the truth; indeed, however much a slandered man may want to defend
himself, he will not let him do so, because he is


<pb n="379"/>

prejudiced by the surprising nature of what he has’
heard, just as if that made it true.

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="16"><p>


A very effective form of slander is the one that is
based on opposition to the hearer’s tastes. For instance, in the court of the Ptolemy who was called
Dionysus<note n="1">Probably Ptolemy Auletes, father of Cleopatra, who
styled himself "the new Dionysus.”</note> there was once a man who accused Demetrius, the Platonic philosopher, of drinking nothing
but water and of being the only person who did not
wear women’s clothes during the feast of Dionysus.
If Demetrius, on being sent for early the next morning, had ‘not drunk wine in view of everybody and
had not put on a thin gown and played the cymbals
and danced, he would have been put to death for not
liking the king’ s mode of life, and being a critic and
an opponent of Ptolemy’s luxury.

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="17"><p>

In the court of Alexander it was once the greatest
of all slanderous charges to say that a man did not
worship Hephaestion or even make obeisance to him
—for after the death of Hephaestion, Alexander for
the love he bore him determined to add to his other
great feats that of appointing the dead man a god.
So the cities at once erected temples; plots of ground -
were consecrated ; altars, sacrifices and feasts were
established in honour of this new god, and everybody’s strongest oath was “By Hephaestion.” If
anyone smiled at what went on or failed to'seem
quite reverent, the penalty prescribed was death.
The flatterers, taking hold of this childish passion
of Alexander’s, at once began to feed it and fan it
into flame by telling about dreams of Hephaestion,
in that way ascribing to him visitations and cures |
and accrediting him with prophecies; and at last



<pb n="381"/>

they began to sacrifice to him as “‘ Coadjutor” and
"Saviour.”<note n="1">In this way they made him out the associate of Apollo.</note>
Alexander liked to hear all this, and
at length believed it, and was very proud of himself for being, as he thought, not only the son of
a god but also able to make gods. Well, how many
of Alexander's friends, do you suppose, reaped the
results of Hephaestion’s divinity during that period,
through being accused of not honouring the universal god, and consequently being banished and
deprived of the king’s favour?

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="18"><p>

It was then that
Agathocles of Samos, one of Alexander’s captains
whom he esteemed highly, came near being shut up
in a lion’s den because he was charged with having
wept as he went by the tomb of Hephaestion. But
Perdiccas is said to have come to his rescue, swearing
by all the gods and by Hephaestion to boot that
while he was hunting the god had appeared to him
in the flesh and had bidden him tell Alexander to
spare Agathocles, saying that he had not wept from
want of faith or because he thought Hephaestion
dead, but only because he had been put in mind
of their old-time friendship.

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="19"><p>


As you see, flattery and slander were most likely
to find an opening when they were framed with
reference to Alexander's weak point. In a siege
the enemy do not attack the high, sheer and secure
parts of the wall, but wherever they notice that any
portion is unguarded, unsound or low, they move all
their forces against that place because they can very
easily get in there and take the city. Just so with
slanderers: they assail whatever part of the soul
they perceive to be weak, unsound and easy of
access, bringing their siege-engines to bear on it



<pb n="383"/>

and finally capturing it, as no one opposes them or
notices their assault. Then, when they are once
within the walls, they fire everything and smite and
slay and banish ; for all these things are likely to
happen when the soul is captured and put in
bondage.

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="20"><p>
The engines that they use against the hearer
are deceit, lying, perjury, insistence, impudence, and
a thousand other unprincipled means; but the most
important of all is flattery, a bosom friend, yes, an
own sister to slander. Nobody is so high-minded
and has a soul so well protected by walls of adamant
that he cannot succumb to the assaults of flattery,
especially when he is being undermined and his
foundations sapped by slander.

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="21"><p>

All this is on the
outside, while on the inside there are many traitors
who help the enemy, holding out their hands to him,
opening the gates, and in every way furthering
the capture of the hearer. First there is fondness
for novelty, which is by nature common to all
mankind, and ennui also; and secondly, a tendency
to be attracted by startling rumours. Somehow or
other we all like to hear stories that are slyly
whispered in our ear, and are packed with innuendo:
indeed, I know men who get as much pleasure from
having their ears titillated with slander as some do
from being tickled with feathers.


<pb n="385"/>

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="22"><p>
Therefore, when the enemy falls on with all these
forces in league with him, he takes the fort by storm,
I suppose, and his victory cannot even prove difficult,
since nobody mans the walls or tries to repel
his attacks. No, the hearer surrenders of his own
accord, and the slandered person is not aware of the
design upon him: slandered men are murdered
in their sleep, just as when a city is captured in
the night.

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="23"><p>
The saddest thing of all is that the slandered
man, unaware of all that has taken place, meets his
friend cheerfully, not being conscious of any misdeed,
and speaks and acts in his usual manner, when he
is beset on every side, poor fellow, with lurking foes.
The other, if he is noble, gentlemanly, and outspoken, at once lets his anger burst out and vents
his wrath, and then at last, on permitting a defence
to be made, finds out that he was incensed at_ his
friend for nothing.

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="24"><p>

But if he is ignoble and mean
he welcomes him and smiles at him out of the
corner of his mouth, while all the time he hates
him and secretly grinds his teeth and broods, as the
poet says<note n="1">Homer; the word is frequent in the Odyssey (e.g. 9, 316 ; 17, 66).</note> on his anger. Yet nothing, I think, is
more unjust or more contemptible than to bite
your lips and nurse your bitterness, to lock your
hatred up within yourself and nourish it, thinking
one thing in the depths of your heart and saying
another, and acting a very eventful tragedy, full of
lamentation, with a jovial comedy face.</p>

<p>
Men are more liable to act in this way when
the slanderer has long seemed to be a friend of
the person slandered, and yet does what he does.



<pb n="387"/>

In that case they are no longer willing even
to hear the voice of the men slandered or of those
who speak in their behalf, for they assume in
advance that the accusation can be relied on
because of the apparent friendship of long standing,
without even reflecting that many reasons for hatred .
often arise between the closest friends, of which
the rest of the world knows nothing. Now and
then, too, a man makes haste to accuse his neighbour of something that he is himself to blame for,
trying in this way to escape accusation himself.
And in general, nobody would venture to slander
an enemy, for in that case his accusation would not
inspire belief, as its motive would be patent. No,
they attack those men who seem to be their best
friends, aiming to show their good will toward their
hearers by sacrificing even their nearest and dearest
to help them.

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="25"><p>

There are people who, even if they afterwards
learn that their friends have been unjustly accused
to them, nevertheless, because they are ashamed of
their own credulity, no longer can endure to receive
them or look at them, as though they themselves
had been wronged merely by finding out that the
others were doing no wrong at all!

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="26"><p>

It follows, then, that life has been filled with
troubles in abundance through the slanderous stories
that have been believed so readily and so unquestioningly. Anteia says:

<cit>
<quote>
<l>Die, Proetus, or despatch Bellerophon,</l>
<l>Who offered me his love, by me unsought,</l>
</quote>
<bibl>Homer, Iliad 6, 164.</bibl></cit>
when she herself had made the first move and had

<pb n="389"/>

been scorned. So the young man came near getting
killed in the encounter with the Chimaera, and was
rewarded for his continence and his respect for his
host by being plotted against by a wanton. As for
Phaedra, she too made a similar charge against her
stepson and so brought it about that Hippolytus was
cursed by his father
<note n="1">Theseus: the story is told in the Hippolytus of Euripides.</note>
when he had done nothing
impious—good Heavens, nothing !
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="27"><p>

“Yes,” somebody will say, “but now and then
the man who brings a personal charge deserves
credence, because he seems to be just in all other
matters and sensible also, and one would have to
heed him, as he would never do such a scoundrelly
thing as that.” Well, is there anyone more just than
Aristides? But even he conspired against Themistocles and had a hand in stirring up the people
against him, because, they say, he was secretly
pricked by the same political ambition as Themistocles. Aristides was indeed just, in comparison with
the rest of the world; but he was a man like anyone
else and had spleen and not only loved but hated on
occasion.

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="28"><p>

And if the story of Palamedes is true, the
most sensible of the Greeks and the best of them in
other ways stands convicted of having, through envy,
framed a plot and an ambush to trap a kinsman and
a friend, who had sailed away from home to front
the same peril as he<note n="2">Odysseus trapped Palamedes by getting a forged letter
from Priam hidden in his tent and then pretending to
discover it.</note>; so true is it that to err in this
direction is inborn in all mankind.

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="29"><p>

Why should I
mention Socrates, who was unjustly slandered to the
Athenians as an irreligious man and a traitor? or




<pb n="391"/>

Themistocles and Miltiades, both of whom, after
all their victories, came to be suspected of treason
against Greece? The instances are countless, and
are already for the most part well known.

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="30"><p>

“Then what should a man do, if he has sense
and lays claim to probity or truthfulness?.” In my
opinion he should do what Homer suggested in his
parable of the Sirens. He bids us to sail past these
deadly allurements and to stop our ears ; not to hold
them wide open to men prejudiced by passion, but,
setting Reason as a strict doorkeeper over all that is
said, to welcome and admit what deserves it, but
shut out and drive off what is bad. For surely,
it would be ridiculous to have doorkeepers to guard
your house, but to leave your ears and your mind
wide open.

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="31"><p>

Therefore, when a man comes and tells
you a thing of this sort, you must investigate the
matter on its own merits, without regarding the years
of the speaker or his standing, or his carefulness in
what he says; for the more plausible a man is, the
closer your investigation should be. You should not,
then, put faith in another's judgment, or rather
(as you would be doing), in the accuser’s want of
judgment,
<note n="1">Literally, "in the accuser’s hatred.” To secure something like the word-play in the Greek, the sense had to
suffer slightly.</note>
but should reserve to yourself the province
of investigating the truth, accrediting the slanderer
with his envy and conducting an open examination
into the sentiments of both men; and you should
only hate or love a man after you have put him to
the proof. To do so before that time, influenced
by the first breath of slander—Heavens! how


<pb n="393"/>

childish, how base and, beyond everything, how unjust! But the cause of this and all the rest of it, as
I said in the beginning, is ignorance, and the fact
that the real character of each of us is shrouded in
darkness. Hence, if some oné of the gods would
only unveil our lives, Slander would vanish away
to limbo, having no place left, since everything would
be illumined by Truth.

<head>THE CONSONANTS AT LAW SIGMA vs. TAU,

[In the year that Aristarchus of Phalerum was archon,
on the seventh day of the month Pyanepsion, Sigma

assault and robbery, alleging that he had stolen all the
words that are pronounced mith double tau.]

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="2"><p>

Vowels of the jury, as long as the wrongs that I
underwent at the hands of this fellow Tau through
his misusing my property and establishing himself
where he had no business were but slight, I did not
take the injury to heart, and I ignored some of the
things that I heard because of the equable temper
which, as you know, I maintain toward you and the
other letters. But now that he has come to such a
pitch of self-seeking and lawlessness that, not content
with what I have repeatedly let pass in silence, he is
trying to wrest still more from me, I am compelled
to call him to account before you, who know both
sides. Besides all this, I am more than a little afraid
of my own ejection; for by making greater and


<pb n="399"/>

greater additions to what he has already done he will
altogether eject me from my own estate, so that if I
keep quiet I shall scarcely count at all as a letter,
and shall be no better than a hiss.

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="3"><p>

It is fitting, then, that you who are now on the
jury and all the other letters, too, should be on your
guard against his pernicious activity, for if anyone
who wants to may work his way out of his own place
into someone else’s, and if you Vowels, without whom
nothing can be written that means anything, are
going to permit this, I do not see how society is
to keep the orthodox distinctions of rank which
were fixed for it in the beginning. But I do not
think you will ever reach such a pitch of negligence
and carelessness as to permit anything unjust, and
even if you do shirk your duty I cannot overlook my
wrongs. If only the others had been thwarted in
their audacity long ago, when they first began to be
law-breakers!

The man who first framed these laws
for us, be he the islander Cadmus<note n="1">The story usually ran that Cadmus brought sixteen
letters from Phoenicia to Greece, and that four were added
to these by Palamedes and four more by Simonides (not the
poet, but a physician of Syracuse). Cadmus is here called
an islander because some versions of his story made him
come from Tyre, not Sidon.</note> or Nauplius’ son
Palamedes(and some attribute this provision to Simonides), did not determine which of us should be first
and which second solely by putting us in the order
in which our places are now fixed, but they also
decided the qualities and powers that each of us has.
To you, jurors, they gave the greatest honour, because
you can be sounded by yourselves; to the Semivowels
they gave the next highest, because they need
something put with them before they can be heard ;
and they prescribed that the last place of all should
belong to nine letters which have no sound at all by
themselves.

could not have made himself heard unless two of
your number, Alpha and Upsilon, stout fellows and
good to look on, had come to his aid—this Tau, I
say, has had the audacity to injure me beyond
all precedent in acts of violence, not only ousting me from my hereditary nouns and verbs, but
banishing me likewise from conjunctions and prepositions all at once, so that I cannot stand his
monstrous greed any longer. Where and how he
began it, you shall now hear.

Once I made a visit to Cybelus, which is rather an
agreeable little village, settled, the story has it, by .
Athenians. I took with me sturdy Rho, the best of ~
neighbours, and stopped at the house of a comic poet
called Lysimachus, evidently a Boeotian by descent,
though he would have it that he came from the
heart of Attica.
<note n="1">Lysimachus is called a Boeotian because to say s for t
was a characteristic of the Boeotian dialect.</note> It was at that foreigner’s that
I detected the encroachments of this fellow Tau. As
long as it was but little that he attempted, venturing
to mispronounce four (τέσσαρα—τέτταρα) and forty
(τεσσαράκοντα—τετταράκοντα), and also to lay hands on
to-day (σήμερον—τήμερον), and the like and say they
were his own, thus depriving me of my kith and kin
among the letters, I thought it was just his way and
could put up with what I heard, and was not much
annoyed over my losses.

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="9"><p>

But when he went on and
ventured to mispronounce tin (κασσίτερον—καττίτερον)
and shoe-leather (κάσσυμα—κάττυμα), and tar (πίσσα—πίττα), and then, losing all sense of shame, to miscall
queens (βασίλισσα—βασίλιττα), I am uncommonly
annoyed and hot about all this, for I am afraid that
in course of time someone may miscall a spade !<note n="2">An allusion to the English saying is here substituted for
a similar allusion to its Greek equivalent, "to call a fig a
fig” (τὰ σῦκα σῦκα ὀνομάζειν).</note>
Pardon me, in the name of Heaven, for my righteous
anger, discouraged as I am and bereft of partisans.
I am not risking a trifling, every-day stake, for he is
robbing me of acquaintances and companions among
the letters. He snatched a blackbird, a talkative




<pb n="405"/>

creature, right out of my bosom, almost, and renamed it (κίσσα—κίττα) ; he took away my pheasant
(¢décca—ddrra) along with my ducks (νήσσαι—νήτται)
and my daws (κόσσυφοι—κόττυφοι), although Aristarchus forbade him; he robbed me of not a few
bees (μέλισσα—μέλιττα), and he went to Attica and
illegally plucked Hymessus (Ὑμησσός—Ὑμηττός) out
of the very heart of her, in full view of yourselves
and the other letters. But why mention this? He
has turned me out of all Thessaly, wanting it called
Thettaly, has swept me from the sea (θάλασσα—ϑάλαττα) and “has not even spared me the beets
(σεύτλια—τεύτλια) in my garden, so that, to quote the
proverb, he hasn’t even left me a peg (πάσσαλος—πάτταλος).</p>

<p>
That I am a much-enduring letter, you yourselves
can testify, for I never brought Zeta to book for
taking my emerald (σμάραγδος—ζὡμάραγδος) and robbing me utterly of Smyrna,
<note n="1">Pronounced, as it is to-day, Zmyrna, but written usually
with s.</note>
nor Xi for overstepping
every treaty (συνθήκη—ξυνθήκη) with Thucydides
the historian (συγγραφεύς—ξυγγραφεύς) as his ally
(ύμμαχος—ξύμμαχος): And when my neighbour
ho was ill I forgave him not only for transplanting -
my myrtles (μυρσίνη—-μυῤῥίνη) into his own garden,
but also for cracking my crown (κόρση—κόρρη) in a
fit of insanity.

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="10"><p>

That is my disposition, but this Tau—
just see how bad-natured he is toward the others,
too! To show that he has not let the rest of the
letters alone, but has injured Delta and Theta and
Zeta and almost all the alphabet, please call to the
stand the injured parties in person. Listen, Vowels
of the jury, to Delta, who says: “He robbed me of



<pb n="407"/>

endelechy, wanting it to be called entelechy agairist
all the laws”; to Theta crying and pulling out the
hair of his head because he has had even his pumpkin
(κολοκύνθη—-κολοκύντη) taken away from him, and to
Zeta, who has lost his whistle (συρίζειν—συρίττειν) and
trumpet (σαλπίζειν—σαλπίττειν), so that he can’t even
make a sound (γρύζειν—γρύττειν) any longer. Who
could put up with all this, and what punishment
could be bad enough for this out-and-out rascal Tau ?

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="11"><p>


Not only does he injure his own kinsfolk of the
alphabet, but he has already attacked the human
race also; for he does not allow them to talk straight
with their tongues. Indeed , jurymen—for speaking of
men has suddenly put mein mind of the tongue—he
has banished me from this member too, as far as in
him lay, and makes glotta out of glossa. O Tau, thou
very plague o’ the tongue! But I shall attack him
another time and advise men of his sins against
them, in trying to fetter their speech, as it were,
and to mangle it. A man on seeing something
pretty (καλόν)  wants to call it so, but Tau interferes
and makes him say something else (ταλόν),
<note n="1">One would expect a pun here, but ταλόν is not in the
dictionaries.</note> wanting
to have precedence in everything. Again, another
is talking about a palm-branch (κλῆμα), but Tau, the
very criminal (τλήμων), turns the palm-branch into a
crime (τλῆμα). And not only does he injure ordinary
people, but even the Great King, in whose honour,
they say, even land and sea give place and depart
from their own natures—even he is plotted against
by Tau, who instead of Cyrus makes him out something of a cheese (Κῦρος—τυρός).

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="12"><p>
That is the way he injures mankind as far as their



<pb n="409"/>

speech is concerned, but look at the material injury
he has done them! Men weep and bewail their lot
and curse Cadmus over and over for putting Tau into
the alphabet, for they say that their tyrants,
following his figure and imitating his build, have
fashioned timbers in the same shape and crucify men
upon them; and that it is from him that the sorry
device gets its sorry name (stauros, cross). For all
this do you not think that Tau deserves to die many
times over? As for me, I hold that in all justice
we can only punish Tau by making a T of him.
<note n="1">Te, by crucifying him, Greek crosses being usually
T-shaped. MSS. add "for the cross owes its existence to
Tau, but its name to man” ; see critical note.</note>

They say you had all kinds of sport yesterday,
Lycinus, at the house of Aristaenetus, at dinner, and
that several speeches on philosophy were made, out
of which quite a quarrel arose. Unless Charinus was
lying, the affair even ended in wounds and the party
was finally broken up by the shedding of blood.</p>

<p><label>LYCINUS</label>
Now how did Charinus know that, Philo? He did
not dine with us.</p>

<p><label>PHILO</label>
He said that Dionicus, the doctor, told “him.
Dionicus, I suppose, was one of the guests.</p>

<p><label>LYCINUS</label>
Yes, to be sure ; but even he was not there for all
of it, from the very beginning: it was late and the
battle was about half over when he came on the
scene, a little before the wounds. So J am surprised
that he could give a clear account of any of it, as he
did not witness what led up to the quarrel that
ended in bloodshed.

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="2"><p>
<label>PHILO</label>
True, Lycinus; and for that very reason Charinus
told us, if we wanted to hear the truth of it and all
the details, to come to you, saying that Dionicus


<pb n="415"/>

himself had said that he was not there for all ot it,
but that you knew exactly what had happened and
could actually recite the speeches, being, as you are,
an attentive and not a careless listener to such
discussions. So do hurry and give us this most
delightful entertainment—-for none, I am sure, could
»be more delightful, at least to me, especially as we
‘shall enjoy a peaceful and bloodless entertainment,
without intemperance and out of range of missiles,
whether it was old men or young who misconducted
themselves at dinner, led on by strong drink to do
and say what they should not.

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="3"><p>
<label>LYCINUS</label>
It was rather a silly affair, Philo, and yet you want
me to publish it abroad and tell what happened when
heads were turned with wine, when it all should be
forgotten and the whole business put down'to a god— .
Dionysus, I mean, who scarcely permits anyone to
remain uninitiated in his rites and a stranger to his
revels. Don’t you think it rather bad form to
enquire into such matters minutely? The proper
thing is to leave them behind you in the diningroom when you go away. As you know, there is a
saying from the poets: “I hate to drink with him
that hath a memory.”
<note n="1">Author unknown : quoted also by Plutarch (Prooemium to
Quaest. Sympos.). See also Index to Corpus Paroemiogr. Gr.</note>
And Dionicus did not do
right, either, to blab it all to Charinus and besprinkle philosophers with the copious dregs of their
stale cups. As for me—get out with you! I shan’t
tell you anything of the kind !</p>

<p><label>PHILO</label>
That is all put on, Lycinus. But you needn’t have
acted that way with me, for I know very well that



<pb n="417"/>

you are much more eager to talk than I to listen, and
I have an idea that if you had nobody to listen to
you, you would enjoy going up to a pillar or a statue
and pouring it all out in a stream, without a pause.
In fact, if I should wish to go away now, you would
not let me go untold, but would hold me and follow
me and entreat me. And now I am going to take
my turn at putting on. (Turns to‘another friend.) If
you like, let’s go and find out about it from someone
else. (To Lyctnus.) You may keep your story to
yourself!</p>

<p><label>LYCINUS</label>
Don’t get angry! I will tell you, since you
are so anxious, but don’t you tell a lot of people.</p>

<p><label>PHILO</label>
If I have not forgotten all I know of you, Lycinus,
you will do that better than I can, and you will
lose no time in telling everybody, so that I shan’t be
needed.

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="4"><p>

But first tell me one thing—was it to
celebrate the wedding of his son Zeno that
Aristaenetus entertained you ?</p>

<p><label>LYCINUS</label>
No, he was marrying his daughter Cleanthis to
the son of Eucritus the banker, the lad who is
studying philosophy.</p>

<p><label>PHILO</label>
A very good-looking lad, to be sure; still immature, though, and hardly old enough to be married.</p>

<p><label>LYCINUS</label>
But he could not find anyone who suited him
better, I suppose. As this boy seemed to be
mannerly and had taken an interest in philosophy,


<pb n="419"/>

and also as he was the only son of Eucritus, who is
rich, he preferred him to all the rest as a husband
for his daughter.</p>

<p><label>PHILO</label>
You give a very good reason in saying that Eucritus
is rich. But come, Lycinus, who were the people
at dinner ?

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="5"><p>

<label>LYCINUS</label>
Why should I tell you all of them? The philoso- .
phers and literary men, whom, I suppose, you
are most eager to hear about, were Zenothemis, the
old man of the Porch,
<note n="1">The Porch: where Zeno the Stoic used to teach.</note> and along with him Diphilus,
whom they call “Labyrinth,” tutor of Aristaenetus’
boy Zeno. From the Walk
<note n="2">The Walk (xepfxaros) in the Lyceum, where the Peripatetics had their meeting-place.</note> there was Cleodemus—
you know him, the mouthy, argumentative fellow,
whom his pupils call “Sword” and “Cleaver.”
Hermon the Epicurean was there too, and as he
came in the Stoics at once began to glower at him
and turn their backs on him; it was clear that they
loathed him as they would a parricide or a man
under a curse. These men had been asked to
dinner as Aristaenetus’ own friends and associates, and
also the grammarian Histiaeus and the rhetorician
Dionysodorus.

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="6"><p>

Then, too, on account of Chaereas, the
bridegroom, Ion the Platonic philosopher, who is his
teacher, shared the feast—a grave and reverend
person to look at, with great dignity written on his
features. Indeed, most people call him “Rule,” out
of regard for the straightness of his thinking. When
he came in, they all arose in his honour and received
him like a supernatural being; in short it was a regular
divine visitation, the advent of Ion the marvellous.

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="7"><p>

By that time we had to take our places, for almost
everyone was there. On the right as you enter, the
women occupied the whole couch, as there were
a good many of them, with the bride among them,
very scrupulously veiled and hedged in by the
women. Toward the back door came the rest of the
company according to the esteem in which each was
held.

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="8"><p>

Opposite the women, the first was Eucritus, |
and then Aristaenetus. Then a question was raised
whether Zenothemis the Stoic should have _precedence, he being an old man, or Hermon the
Epicurean, because he was a priest of the Twin
Brethren and a member of the leading family in the
city. But Zenothemis solved the problem ; “Aristaenetus,” said he, “if you put me second to
this man here,— an Epicurean, to say nothing worse
of him,—I shall go away and leave you in full
possession of your board.” With that he called his
attendant and made as if to go out. So Hermon
said: “Take the place of honour, Zenothemis; but
you would have done well to yield to me because I
am a priest, if for no other reason, however much
you despise Epicurus.” “You make me laugh,’
said Zenothemis: “an Epicurean priest!’ With
these words he took his place, and Hermon next
him, in spite of what had passed ; then Cleodemus
the Peripatetic ; then Ion, and below him the bridegroom, then myself; beside me Diphilus, and
below him his pupil Zeno; and then the rhetorician
Dionysodorus and the grammarian Histiaeus,

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="9"><p>

<label>PHILO</label>
Heavens, Lycinus, it’s a learned academy, this dinner
party that you are telling of! Philosophers almost
to a man. Good for Aristaenetus, I say, because
in celebrating the greatest festival day that there is,
he thought fit to entertain the most learned men in
preference to the rest of the world, and culled the
bloom, as it were, of every school, not including some
and leaving out others, but asking all without
discrimination.</p>

<p><label>LYCINUS</label>
Why, my dear fellow, he is not one of the common
run of rich men; he is interested in culture and
spends the better part of his time with these people.

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="10"><p>

Well, we dined peacefully at first, and were served
with all sorts of dishes, but I don’t suppose there is
any need of enumerating them—the sauces and
pastries and ragouts. There was everything, and
plenty of it. Meanwhile Cleodemus bent over to
Ion and said : “Do you see the old man ?””—meaning
Zenothemis: I was listening, you know. “How he
stuffs himself with the dainties and has covered his
cloak with soup, and how much food he hands to his
attendant standing behind him! He thinks that the
others do not see him, but he forgets the people at
his back. Point it out to Lycinus, so that he can
testify to it.’ But I had no need of Ion to point it
out, for I had seen it all from my coign of vantage
some time ago.

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="11"><p>
Just as Cleodemus said that, Alcidamas the Cynic
romped in uninvited, getting off the commonplace
joke about Menelaus coming of his own accord.
<note n="1">Ihiad 2, 408.</note>
Most of them thought he had done an impudent



<pb n="425"/>

thing, and they slyly retorted. with the first thing
they could think of, one growling under his breath,
<cit>
<quote>
<l>Menelaus, thou’rt a fool!</l></quote> <bibl>Iliad 7, 109.</bibl></cit> another:

<cit>
<quote>
<l>But Agamemnon, Atreus’ son, was sorely vexed,</l></quote> <bibl>Iliad 1, 24.</bibl></cit>

and others
other remarks that, in the circumstances, were to the
point and witty. But nobody dared to speak out,
for they all feared Alcidamas, who was really “good
at the war-cry,”
<note n="3">Like Menelaus: Iliad 2, 408.</note> and the noisiest of all the Cynic
barkers, for which reason he was considered a
superior person and was a great terror to everybody.
Aristaenetus commended him and bade him take
a chair and sit beside Histiaeus and Dionysodorus.
“Get out with you!” said he. “What you tell me
to do is womanish and weak, to sit on a chair or on
a stool, like yourselves on that soft bed, lying almost
flat on your batks while you feast, with purple cloths
under you. I shall take my dinner on my feet as I
walk about the dining-room, and if I get tired I'll lie
on the floor, leaning on my elbow, with my cloak
under me, like Heracles in the pictures they paint
of him.” “Very well,” said Aristaenetus ; “if you
prefer it that way.” Then Alcidamas began to
circle about for his dinner, shifting 1o richer
pasturage as the Scythians do, and following the
orbits of the waiters. But even while he was eating
he was not idle, for he talked of virtue and vice all
the time, and scoffed at the gold and silver plate;
for example, he asked Aristaenetus what was the use
of all those great goblets when earthenware would
do just as well. But he had begun to be a bore by





<pb n="427"/>

this time, so Aristaenetus put a quietus on him for
the moment by directing the waiter to give him a
big bowl and pour him out a stiffer drink. He
thought that he had had a good idea, little realising
what woes that bowl was destined to give rise to.
On taking it, Alcidamas kept quiet for a little while,
throwing himself on the floor and lying there halfnaked as he had threatened, with his elbow squared
under him and the bowl in his right hand, just as
Heracles in the cave of Pholus is represented by
the painters.

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="12"><p>

By this time the cup was going round continually
among the rest of the party, there were toasts and
conversations, and the lights had been brought
in. Meanwhile, noticing that the boy in attendance ~
on Cleodemus, a handsome cup-bearer, was smiling
(I must tell all the incidents of the feast, I suppose,
especially whatever happened that was rather good),
I began to keep special watch to see what he
was smiling about. After a little while he went up
to Cleodemus as if to take the cup from him, and
Cleodemus pressed his finger and gave him two
drachmas, I think, along with the cup. The boy
responded to the pressure of his finger with another
smile, but no doubt did not perceive the money, so
that, through his not taking it, the two drachmas
fell and made a noise,.and they both blushed very
noticeably. Those near by them wondered whose
the coins were ; for the lad said he had not dropped
them, and Cleodemus, beside whom the noise was
made, pretended that he had not let them fall. So
the matter was disregarded and ignored, since not


<pb n="429"/>

very many saw it except surely Aristaenetus, for he
shifted the boy a little later on, sending him out
of the room unobtrusively, and directed one
of the full-grown, muscular fellows, a muleteer
or stable-boy, to wait on Cleodemus. So the affair
turned out in that way, whereas it would have
caused Cleodemus great shame if it had been
speedily noised about among the whole company
instead of being hushed up on the spot by the
clever manner in which Aristaenetus treated the silly
performance.

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="13"><p>

The Cynic Alcidamas, who was tipsy by this time,
enquired the name of the bride, and then, after
calling for silence in a loud voice and fixing his eyes
on the women, he said: “Cleanthis, I pledge you
Heracles, my patron.” Since everybody laughed at
that, he said: “Did you laugh, you scum of the
earth, that I gave the bride a toast to our god
Heracles? I’d have you to know that if she doesn’t
accept the bowl from me, she will never have a son
like me, invincible in courage, unfettered in intellect
and as strong in body as I am,’ and with that
he bared himself still more, in the most shameless
way. Again the guests laughed at all this, and he
got up in anger with a fierce, wild look, clearly
‘ not intending to keep the peace any longer. Per-.
haps he would have hit someone with his staff if just
in the nick of time a huge cake had not been
brought in; but when he set eyes on that, he
became calmer, put away his wrath, and began
to walk about and stuff himself. Most of the


<pb n="431"/>

company were drunk by then, and the room was full
of uproar. Dionysodorus the rhetorician was making
speeches, pleading first on one side and then on the
other, and was getting applauded by the servants
who stood behind him. Histiaeus the grammarian,
who had the place next him, was reciting verse,
combining the lines of Pindar and Hesiod and
Anacreon in such a way as to make out of them a
single poem and a very funny one, especially in the
part where he said, as though foretelling what was
going to happen:

<cit><quote><l>They smote their shields together,</l>
</quote> <bibl>Iliad 4, 447.</bibl></cit>
and

<cit><quote><l>Then lamentations rose, and vaunts of men.</l>
</quote> <bibl>Iliad 4, 450</bibl><note n="2">Ausonius’ Cento Nupiialis, an epithalamium composed of tags from Vergil, illustrates Lucian’s
meaning perfectly.</note></cit>

But Zenothemis was reading aloud from a closely
written book that he had taken from his attendant.
When, as often happens, the service of the waiters
was interrupted for a while, Aristaenetus planned
to prevent even that period from being unentertaining and empty, and ordered the clown to come
in and do or say something funny, in order to
make his guests still merrier. In came an ugly
fellow with his head shaven except for a few hairs
that stood up straight on his crown. First he
danced, doubling himself up and twisting himself
about to cut a more ridiculous figure; then he beat
time and recited scurrilous verses in an Egyptian
brogue, and finally he began to poke fun at the
guests. The rest laughed when they were made
fun of, but when he took a fling at Alcidamas in




<pb n="433"/>

the same way, calling him a Maltese lapdog,
<note n="1">The joke here lies primarily in the play on κύων (Cynic),
but it should also be borne in mind that the Greek name
Melite was given not only to the island of Malta, but to the
deme in Athens in which the worship of Heracles, the patron
of the Cynic sect, was localised.</note> Alcidamas got angry: indeed, for a long time it had
been plain that he was jealous because the other
fellow was making a hit and holding the attention
of the room. So, throwing off his philosopher’s
cloak, he challenged him to fight, or else, he said,
he would lay his staff on him. Then poor Satyrion,
for that was the clown’s name, stood up to him and
fought. It was delicious to see a philosopher squaring
off at a clown, and giving and receiving blows in
turn. Though some. of onlookers were disgusted,
others kept laughing, until finally Alcidamas had
enough of his punishment, well beaten by a tough
little dwarf. So they got roundly laughed at.

At that point Dionicus, the doctor, came in, not
long after the fray. He had been detained, he said,
to attend a man who had gone crazy, Polyprepon the
flute-player; and he told a funny story. He said
that he had gone. into the man’s room without
knowing that he was already affected by the trouble,
and that Polyprepon, getting out of bed quickly, had
locked the door, drawn a knife, handed him his flutes
and told him to begin playing; and then, because
he could not play, had beaten him with a strap on
the palms of his hands. At last in the face of so
great a peril, the doctor devised this scheme: he
challenged him to a match, the loser to get a certain
number of blows. First he himself played wretchedly, and then giving up the flutes to Polyprepon, he



<pb n="435"/>

took the strap and the knife and threw them quickly
out of the window into. the open court. Then,
feeling safer, he grappled with him and called the
neighbours, who prised the door open and rescued
him. And he showed the marks of the blows, and
a few scratches on his face.
Dionicus, who had made no less of a hit than the
clown, thanks to his story, squeezed himself in
beside Histiaeus and fell to dining on what was left.
His coming was a special dispensation, for he proved
very useful in what followed.

You see, a servant
came into the midst of us, saying that he was from
Hetoemocles the Stoic and carrying a paper which
he said his master had told him to read in public, so
that everybody would hear, and then to go back

fit to number me among your friends : no, I alone do
not count with you, and that too though I live next
door. I am indignant, therefore, and more on your
account than on my own, because you have shown
yourself so thankless, For me, happiness is not a
matter of getting a wild boar, a hare or a cake—
things which I enjoy ungrudged at the tables of
other people who know what is right. Indeed, today I might have had dinner with my pupil
Pammenes (and a splendid dinner, too, they say), but
I did not accede to his entreaties, saving myself for
you, fool that I was.

You, however, have given me
the go-by and are entertaining others. No wonder,
for you are even yet unable to distinguish between
the better and the worse, and you have not the
faculty of direct comprehension, either. But I know
where all this comes from—those wonderful philosophers of yours, Zenothemis and the Labyrinth, whose
mouths I could very soon stop, I know, with a single
syllogism, Heaven forgive me for boasting! Just

you have not lost, you have; but you have not lost horns,

But if you think that I am angry over
a mere dinner, call to mind the story of Oeneus and
you will see that Artemis herself was angry because
she was the only one whom he had not asked to the

While all that was being read, my dear fellow, the
sweat poured off me for shame, and to quote the
saying, I prayed that the earth would swallow me
when I saw the guests all laughing at every
sentence, especially as many as knew Hetoemocles,
a man with gray hair who looked to be highminded. It was a marvel to me that such a man
had hoodwinked them, deceiving them with his
beard and the concentration expressed in his
features. It was my notion that Aristaenetus
had not carelessly overlooked him, but that, not
thinking he would accept if invited, he would not
expose himself to any such treatment, and so thought
best not to try him at all. When at last the slave
stopped reading, the whole party looked at Zeno and
Diphilus, who were frightened and pale, and by the
distress in their faces acknowledged the truth of the


<pb n="443"/>

charges brought by Hetoemocles. Aristaenetus was
perturbed and fall of confusion, but he told us to go
on drinking just the same and tried to smooth the
business over, smiling as he did so; the servant he
sent away with the words: “I will see to it.” After
a little while Zeno withdrew unobservedly, for his
attendant directed him to go, as if at the bidding of
his father.

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="21"><p>

Cleodemus had long been looking for an opportunity, as he wanted to pitch into the Stoics and was
ready to burst because he could not find a satisfactory
opening. But at last the letter gave him his cue,
and he said: “That is what your noble Chrysippus
does, and your wonderful Zeno and Cleanthes!
They are nothing but miserable phrase-makers and
question-mongers, philosophers in dress, but in-all
else just like Hetoemocles, most of them. And the
letter—see how venerable it is! To cap all, Aristaenetus is Oeneus and Hetoemocles is Artemis! Good
Lord! In excellent taste, all of it, and just the
thing for a festive occasion!”

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="22"><p> “Yes,” said Hermon,
from his place above Cleodemus, “I suppose he had
heard that Aristaenetus had a boar ready for the
dinner, so that he thought it not inopportune to
mention the boar of Calydon. Come, Aristaenetus,
in the name of Hospitality send him a portion with
all speed, for fear you may be too late and the old
man may waste away like Meleager from hunger!
Yet it would be no hardship to him, for Chrysippus
held that all such things are of no import.”


<note n="1">The Stoics divided the objects of human endeavour into
three classes—the good, which were to be sought; the
bad, which were to be shunned; and the indifferent, or

<pb n="445"/>

“What, do you dare to mention the name of
Chrysippus ?” said Zenothemis, rousing himself and
shouting at the top of his voice."Dare you judge
Cleanthes and Zeno, who were learned men, by a
single individual who is not a regular philosopher, by
Hetoemocles the charlatan? Whoare you two, pray,
to say all that? Hermon, didn’t you cut off the hair
of the Twin Brethren because it was gold?<note n="1">Antique statues with golden (or gilded) hair are
mentioned not infrequently. In the  "Timon” (4) Lucian
alludes to the theft of the hair from the head of the famous
statue of Zeus in Olympia.</note>
You'll
suffer for it, too, when the executioner gets you!
And as for you, Cleodemus, you had an affair with
the wife of your pupil Sostratus, and were found out
and grossly mishandled. Have the grace to hold your
tongues, then, with such sins on your consciences !”’
“But I don’t sell the favours of my own wife as you
do,” said Cleodemus, “nor did I take my foreign pupil’s
allowance in trust and then swear by Athena Polias
that I never had it, nor do I lend money at four per
cent. a month, nor throttle my pupils if they fail to
pay their fees in time.” “But you can’t deny,” said
Zenothemis, “that you sold Crito a dose of poison for
his father!”

And with that, being in the act of
drinking, he flung on the pair all that was left in the
cup, and it was about half full! Ion also got the
benefit of his nearness to them, and he quite deserved
it. Well, Hermon, bending forward, began wiping
the wine from his head and calling the guests to
witness what had been done to him. But Cleodemus,
not having a cup, whirled about and spat on Zenothemis; then, taking him by the beard with his left
hand, he was about to hit him in the face, and would



<pb n="447"/>

have’ killed the old man if Aristaenetus had not
stayed his hand, stepped over Zenothemis and lain
down between them, to separate them and make
them keep the peace with him for a dividing-wall.

While all this was going -on, Philo, various
thoughts were in my mind; for example, the very
obvious one that it is no good knowing the liberal
arts if one doesn’t improve his way of living, too.
At any rate, the men I have mentioned, though
clever in words, were getting laughed at, I saw, for
their deeds. And then I could not help wondering
whether what everyone says might not after all be
true, that education leads men away from right
thinking, since they persist in having no regard for
anything but books and the thoughts in them. At
any rate, though so many philosophers were present,
there really was not a single one to be seen who was
devoid of fault, but some acted disgracefully and
some talked still more disgracefully ;  and I could not
lay what was going on to the wine, considering what
Hetoemocles had written without having had either
food or drink.

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="26"><p>

The tables were turned, then, and
the unlettered folk were manifestly dining i in great
decorum, without either getting maudlin or behaving
disreputably ; they simply laughed and passed judgement, perhaps, on the others, whom they used to
admire, thinking them men of importance because of
the garb they wore. The learned men, on the
contrary, were playing the rake and abusing each
other and gorging themselves and bawling and
coming to blows ; and “marvellous” Alcidamas even
made water right there in the room, without showing


<pb n="449"/>

any respect for the women. It seemed to me that,
to use the best possible simile, the events of the
dinner were very like what the poets tell of Discord.
They say, you know, that, not having been asked to
the wedding of Peleus, she threw the apple into the
company, and that from it arose the great war at
Troy.
<note n="1">The golden apple, for the fairest of the goddesses, was
awarded to Aphrodite by Paris, who was paid for his
decision by being given the love of Helen.</note>
Well, to my thinking ‘Hetoemocles by
throwing his. letter into the midst of us like an
Apple of Discord had brought on woes quite as great
as those of the Iliad.

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="27"><p>

The friends of Zenothemis and Cleodemus did not
stop quarrelling when Aristaenetus came between
them. “For the present,’ said Cleodemus, “it is
enough if you Stoics are shown up in your ignorance,
but to-morrow I will pay you back as I ought. Tell
me, then, Zenothemis, or you, Diphilus, you pattern
of propriety, why it is that although you say moneygetting is of no import, you aim at nothing in the
world but getting more, and for this reason always
hang about rich people and lend money and extort
high interest and teach for pay; and again, why is
it that although you hate pleasure and inveigh
against the Epicureans, you yourselves do to others
and suffer others to do to you all that is most
shameful for pleasure’s sake; you get angry if a
man does not ask you to dinner, and when you are
actually asked, you not only eat quantities but hand
over quantities to your servants,’—and with that
he tried to pull away the napkin that Zenothemis’
slave was holding. It was full of meats of all kinds,
and he intended to open it and throw its contents



<pb n="451"/>

on the ground, but the slave clung to it stoutly and
did not let him.

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="28"><p>

“Bravo, Cleodemus,” said Hermon;
“let them tell why they inveigh against pleasure
when they themselves want to have more of it than
the rest of mankind.” “No,” said Zenothemis, “but
do you, Cleodemus, say why you hold that wealth is
important.” “No, that is for you to do!” This
went on for a long while, until Ion, bending forward
to make himself more conspicuous, said : “Stop, and
if you wish I will put before you a topic for a
discussion worthy of the present festal day, and you
shall talk and listen without quarrelling, exactly as
in our Plato’s circle, where most of the time was
passed in discussion.” All the guests applauded,
especially Aristaenetus and Eucritus, who hoped at
least to do away with the unpleasantness in that
way. Aristaenetus went back to his own place,
trusting that peace had been made.

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="29"><p>

At the same
time we were served with what they call the “Full
Dinner”’—a bird apiece, boar’s flesh and_hare’s,
broiled fish, sesame-cakes and sweetmeats; all of
which you had leave to carry away. They did not
put a separate tray in front of each of us, but
Aristaenetus and Eucritus had theirs together on a
single table, and each was to take what was on his
side. In like manner Zenothemis the Stoic and
Hermon the Epicurean had theirs together, and then
Cleodemus and Ion, who came next, and after them
the bridegroom and myself; Diphilus, however, had
two portions set before him, as Zeno had gone away.
Remember all this, Philo, please, because it is of
importance for my story.

<label>LYCINUS</label>
Well, Ion said: “Then I will begin first, if you
like”; and after a little pause: “Perhaps with men of
such distinction here we ought to talk of ‘ideas’ and
incorporeal entities and the immortality of the soul ;
but in order that I may not be contradicted by all
those who are not of the same belief in philosophy,
I shall take the topic of marriage and say what is
fitting. It were best not to need marriage, but to
follow Plato and Socrates and be content with friendship: at all events only such as they can attain perfection in virtue. But if we must marry, we should
have our wives in common, as Plato held, so as to be
devoid of envy.”
These remarks gave rise to laughter, because
they were made out of season. But Dionysodorus
said : “Stop your outlandish jabbering! Where can
the word envy be found in that sense, and in what
author?”<note n="1">The rhetorician ζῆλος at Ion for using ¢jAos in the sense
of ζηλοτυπία, ‘ jealousy in love.’</note> “What, do you dare open your mouth,
you scum of the earth?” said Ion, and Dionysodorus
began to give him back his abuse in due form.
But the grammarian Histiaeus (simple soul!) said:
“Stop, and I will read you a wedding-song,” and
began to read. The verses were these, if I remember
right :
<quote>

</quote>

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="31"><p>

That caused a laugh, as you can imagine; and
then it was time to take what was set before us.
Aristaenetus and Eucritus each took the portion in
front of him: I took what was mine and Chaereas
what was set before him, and Ion and Cleodemus
did likewise. But Diphilus wanted to carry off not
only his own but all that had been served for Zeno,
who was away; he said that it had been served
to him alone, and fought with the servants. They
caught hold of the bird and tried to pull it away
from each other as if they were tugging at the body
of Patroclus, and at last he was beaten and let go.
He made the company laugh heartily, especially
because he was indignant afterwards, just as if he
had been done the greatest possible wrong.

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="32"><p>

Hermon and Zenothemis were lying side by side,
as I have said, Zenothemis above and Hermon below
him. The shares served them were identical in all
but one point, and they began to take them



<pb n="457"/>

peaceably. But the bird in front of Hermon was
the plumper, just by chance, no doubt. In that case
too each should have taken his own, but at this
juncture Zenothemis—follow me closely, Philo, for
we have now reached the crisis of events—Zenothemis, I say, let the bird beside him alone and proceeded to take the one before Hermon, which was
fatter, as I have said. Hermon, however, seized it
also and would not let him be greedy. Thereat
there was a shout: they fell on and actually hit
one another in the face with the birds, and each
caught the other by the beard and called for help,
Hermon to Cleodemus, and Zenothemis to Alcidamus
and Diphilus. The philosophers took sides, some
with one, and some with the other, except Ion alone.

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="33"><p>

That man
kept himself neutral, and they pitched in
and fought. Zenothemis picked up a bowl that was
on the table in front of Aristaenetus and threw it at
Hermon,

<cit><quote><l>And him it missed and went another way; </l>
</quote>
<bibl>Cf. Iliad 11, 233</bibl></cit>

but it cracked the crown of the bridegroom,
inflicting a wound that was generous and deep. Consequently there was an outcry from the women, and
most of them sprang to the battle-field, especially
the lad’s mother when she saw the blood; and the
bride also sprang from her place in alarm over him.
Meanwhile Alcidamas distinguished himself on the
side of Zenothemis. Laying about him with his
staff, he broke the head of Cleodemus and the jaw of
Hermon, and he disabled several of the servants
who were trying to rescue them. But the -other



<pb n="459"/>

side did not give way, for Cleodemus with a stifl
finger gouged out the eye of Zenothemis and got him
by the nose and bit it off, while as for Hermon, when
Diphilus was coming to the support of Zenothemis
he threw him head first from the couch.

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="34"><p>

Histiaeus
the grammarian was wounded, too, in trying to
separate them—he was kicked .in the teeth, I think,
by Cleodemus, who supposed him to be Diphilus.
At all events the poor fellow was laid low, “vomiting
gore,” as his own Homer says. The whole place,
however, was full of noise and tears, and the women,
gathered about Chaereas, were wailing, while the
rest of the men were trying to quiet things down.
Alcidamas wes the greatest nuisance in the world,
for when he had once routed his opponents he hit
everybody that fell in his way. Many would have
gone down before him, you may be sure, if he had
not broken his staff. As for me, I stood by the
wall and watched the whole performance without
taking part in it, for Histiaeus had taught me how -
tisky it is to try to part such fights. You would
have said they were Lapiths and Centaurs, to see
tables going over, blood flowing and cups flying.

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="35"><p>


At last Alcidamas knocked over the lamp-stand
and brought on profound darkness, and as you can
imagine, the situation became far worse, for it was
not easy for them to provide more light, while on
the other hand many dire deeds were done in the
darkness. When some one finally came in with a


<pb n="461"/>

lamp, Alcidamas was caught stripping the flute-girl
and trying to ravish her, while Dionysodorus
was found to have done something else that was
ridiculous, for as he got up a bowl fell out of the
folds of his cloak. Then by way of clearing himself
he said that Ion had picked it up in the confusion
and had given it to him, so that it might not get
lost; and Ion considerately said that he had done
so.

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="36"><p>

Thereupon the dinner-party broke up. After the
tears, it had ended in a new burst of laughter over
Alcidamas, Dionysodorus and Ion. The wounded
men were carried away in sorry condition, especially
the old man Zenothemis, who had one hand on his
nose and the other on his eye and was shouting that
he was dying with pain, so that Hermon, in spite of
his own sad plight (for he had had two teeth
knocked out) called attention to it and said: “Just
remember, Zenothemis, that you do consider pain of
some cunsequence, after all!” The bridegroom, after
his wound had been dressed by Dionicus, was taken
home with his head wrapped in bandages, in the
carriage in which he had expected to take away his
bride ; it was a bitter wedding that he celebratcd,
poor fellow! As for the rest, Dionicus did the best
he could for them and they were taken of to bed,
most of them vomiting in the streets. But Alcidamas
stayed right there, for they could not turn the man
out, once he had thrown himself down crosswise on
the couch and gone to sleep.


<pb n="463"/>

Well, Philo, that was the end of the dinner-party:
it would be better, though, to say at the close as
they do in the plays of Euripides:

<quote>
<l>In many shapes appear the powers above,</l>
<l>And many things the gods surprise us with,</l>
<l>While those we look for do not come about.<note n="1">These lines occur at the close of the Alcestis, the
Andromache, the Barchae and the Helen, and, with a slight
change, in the Medea.</note></l>
</quote>
For all of it, you know, was quite unexpected. This
much, however, I have at last learned, that it is not
safe for a man of peace to dine with men so
learned.
