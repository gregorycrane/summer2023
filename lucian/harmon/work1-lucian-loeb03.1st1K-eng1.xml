<head>THE DEAD COME TO LIFE, OR THE FISHERMAN<note><p>This is Lucian’s reply to the storm of angry protest which
he had evoked from the schoolmen with his Philosophies for
Sale (II. 450 ff.), wherein, to their mind, he had unwarrantably and outrageously ridiculed the ancient philosophers and
their doctrines.</p>
<p>The scene is in Athens. The dead who have come to life
are the ancient philosophers, bent upon wreaking vengeance
on Frankness, which is Lucian’s alias here.
Eventually conceded a formal trial before Philosophy, he
is acquitted on the plea that his ridicule had not been aimed
at the ancient worthies but at their unworthy successors of
his own time, As these impostors cannot induced to
stand trial, Frankness is empowered to go about and brand
them, so that people can tell them from the genuine philosophers. Before departing on his mission, he fishes up, with a
bait of figs and gold, typical representatives of the chief
schools for the inspection of their founders.</p>
<p>Lucian’s plea is specious, for in Philosophies for Sale he
had certainly shown scant regard for those whom he now
professes to hold in such high esteem. But it is not meant
to be taken seriously ; it is put forward with a wink at the
audience for the sake of turning the tables on his critics.
His new-found deference, moreover, is well seasoned with
irony, and quite offset by the pose of urbane and patronizing
superiority which he assumes in feigned unconsciousness.
e piece is almost all persiflage, and maddeningly unanswerable for that reason.</p>
<p>The dialogue is strikingly like an Aristophanic comedy in
its construction, especially in the fact that it has a clearly
marked second part, somewhat loosely attached to the first,
which develops a series of incidents after the plot has been
worked out. Because of this similarity, and for many other
reasons too, none of Lucian’s writings better serves to introduce and illustrate the Double Indictment, which follows it.</p></note></head>

sure? Let us invent a complex death for him, such
as to satisfy us all; in fact he deserves to die seven
times over for each of us.
PHILOSOPHER
I suggest he be crucified.

Yes, by Heaven; but flogged beforehand.
ANOTHER
Let him have his eyes put out long beforehand
ANOTHER
Let him have that tongue of his cut off, even
longer beforehand.
SOCRATES
And you, Empedocles—what do you suggest ?

EMPEDOCLES
That he be thrown into my crater,1 so that he may
learn not to abuse his betters.
PLATO
Indeed, the best suggestion would have been for
him, like another Pentheus or Orpheus,
“To find among the crags a riven doom,”2
so that each of us might have gone off with a scrap
of him.

FRANKNESS
No, no! In the name of Him who hears the suppliant,3 spare me!

for mercy. Perhaps you will revere his verses and
will not ignore me when I have recited them :

Oh, what wretched luck! Homer, in whom I had
my greatest hope, is useless to me. I suppose I
must take refuge with Euripides ; perhaps he might
save me :

@
FRANKNESS
Well, then, as you are absolutely determined to
kill me and there is no possibility of my escaping,
do tell me at least who you are and what irreparable
injuries you have received from me that you’ are
irreconcilably angry and have seized me for execution.
PLATO
What dreadful wrongs you have done us you may
ask yourself, you rascal, and those precious dialogues
of yours in which you not only spoke abusively of
Philosophy herself, but insulted us by advertising for
sale, as if in a slave-market, men who are learned,
and what is more, free-born. Indignant at this, we
requested a brief leave of absence from Pluto and
have come up to get you—Chrysippus here, Epicurus, 
Plato (myself), Aristotle over there, Pythagoras here,
who says nothing, Diogenes, and everyone that you
vilified in your dialogues.
@
FRANKNESS
I breathe again, for you will not put me to death
if you understand how I have acted as regards you.
So throw away your stones; or better, keep them.
You will make use of them against those who
deserve them.1

being repeated (§ 11), is not worked out.

FRANKNESS
Truly, gentlemen, you will put to death, you may
depend upon it, the one man in the world whom you
ought to commend as your friend, well-wisher, comrade in thought, and, if it be not in bad taste to say
so, the defender of your teachings, if you put me to
death after I have laboured so earnestly in your
behalf. Take care, then, that you yourselves are not
acting like most of our present-day philosophers by
showing yourselves ungrateful and hasty and inconsiderate toward a benefactor.
PLATO
O what impudence! So we really owe you gratitude
for your abuse, into the bargain? Are you so convinced that you are truly talking to slaves? Will you
actually set yourself down as our benefactor, on top
of all your insolent and intemperate language ?

@

FRANKNESS
Where, pray, and when have I insulted you? I have
always consistently admired philosophy and extolled
you and lived on intimate terms with the writings
that you have left behind. These very phrases that
I utter—where else but from you did I get them?
Culling them like a bee, I make my show with them
before men, who applaud and recognize where and


<pb n="13"/>

from whom and how I gathered each flower; and
although ostensibly it is I whom they admire for the
bouquet, as a matter of fact it is you and your garden,
because you have put forth such blossoms, so gay and
varied in their hues—if one but knows how to select
and interweave and combine them so that they will
not be out of harmony with one another. Would any
man, after receiving this kindly treatment at your
hands,-attempt to speak ill of benefactors to whom
he owes his reputation? Not unless he be like Thamyris or Eurytus in his nature, so as to raise his voice
against the Muses from whom he had the gift of song,
or to match himself against Apollo in archery—and
he the giver of the bow !

@
PLATO
That speech of yours is good rhetoric, my fine
fellow ; but it is directly against your case and only
makes your presumptuousness appear more staggering,
since ingratitude is now added to injustice. For you
got your shafts from us, as you admit, and then turned
them against us, making it your only aim to speak
ill of us all. That is the way you have paid us for
opening that garden to you and not forbidding you
to pick flowers and go away with your arms full.
For that reason, then, above all else, you deserve
to die.

@
FRANKNESS
See! You give me an angry-hearing, and you
reject every just plea! Yet I should never have
supposed that anger could affect. Plato or Chrysippus
or Aristotle or the rest of you; it seemed to me that

<pb n="15"/>

you, and you alone, were surely far away from anything of that kind. But, however that may be, my
masters, do not put me to death unsentenced and
unheard. This too was once a trait of yours, not to
deal with fellow-citizens on a basis of force and
superior strength, but to settle your differences by
course of law, according, a hearing and in your
turn receiving one. So let us choose a judge, and
then you may bring your complaint either jointly
or through anyone whom you may elect to represent you all; and I will defend.myself against
your charges. Then, if I am proven guilty, and the
court passes that verdict upon me, I will submit, of
course, to the punishment that I deserve, and you
will not have taken it upon yourselves to do anything
high-handed. But if after I have undergone my
investigation I am found innocent and irreproachable, 
the jury will discharge me, and you will turn your
anger against those who nave misled you and set
you against me.

@

PLATO
There we have it! “Cavalry into the open,” so that
you may give the slip to the jury and get away.1 At
any rate, they say that you are an orator and a
lawyer and a wizard at making speeches. And whom
do you wish to be judge, what is more? It must be
someone whom you cannot influence by a bribe, as your 
sort often do, to cast an unjust ballot in your favour.
FRANKNESS
Do not be alarmed on that score. I should not
care to have any such referee of suspicious or doubtful
1 As cavalry seeks open country to maneuvre in, so the
lawyer seeks the courtroom. Compare Plato, Theaetetus,
183d: ἱππέας εἰς πεδίον προκαλεῖ, Σωκράτη εἰς λόγους προκαλούμενος.

<pb n="17"/>

character, who would sell me his vote. See, for my
part I nominate Philosophy herself to the bench, and
you yourselves also!
PLATO
And who can conduct the prosecution if we are
to be jurors ?
FRANKNESS
Be prosecutors and jurors at the same time. Even
that arrangement has no terrors for me, since I have
so much the better of you in the justice of my case
and expect to be so over-stocked with pleas.
@
PLATO
What shall we do, Pythagoras and Socrates ?
Really, the man seems to be making a reasonable
request in demanding a trial.
SOCRATES
What can we do but go to court, taking Philosophy _
with us, and hear his defence, whatever it may be.
Prejudgment is not our way ; it is terribly unprofessional, characteristic of hot-headed fellows who
hold that might is right. We shall lay ourselves
open to hard words from those who like to deal in
them if we stone a man who has had no opportunity
even to plead his case, especially as we ourselves
maintain that we delight in just dealing. What
could we say of Anytus and Meletus, who prosecuted me, or of the jurors on that occasion, if this
fellow is to die without getting any hearing at all?1
PLATO
Excellent advice, Socrates; so let us go and get
Philosophy. She shall judge, and we shall be content
with her decision, whatever it may be.
1 Literally, "without getting any water at all"; i.e. any
of the time ordinarily allowed for court speeches, which was
apportioned with a water-clock.

@

FRANKNESS
Well done, most learned sirs; this course is better
and more legal. Keep your stones, however, as I
said ; for you will need them presently at court.
But where is Philosophy to be found? For my part
I do not know where she lives. Yet I wandered very
long in search of her dwelling, so that I might study
with her. Then I met men with short cloaks and
long beards who professed to come directly from her ;
and thinking that they knew, I questioned them.
But they were far more at a loss than I, and either
made no answer, in order that they might not ‘be
convicted of ignorance, or else pointed out one door
after another. Even to this day I have been unable
to find her house.

@
Often, either by guesswork on my own part or
under the guidance of someone else; I would go to a
door in the firm belief that at last I had found it,
drawing my conclusion from the number of men that
came and went, all solemn of countenance, decorous
in dress, and studious in looks. So I would thrust
myself among them and enter also. Then I always
saw a hussy who was far from ingenuous, however
much she strove to bring herself into harmony
with simplicity and plainness. On the contrary, I
perceived at once that she did not leave the apparent
disorder of her hair unenhanced by art, nor let her
mantle hang about her in unstudied folds. It was
patent that she used it all asa make-up and employed
her seeming negligence to heighten her attractiveness. There were also evidences of enamel and
rouge; her talk was quite that of a courtesan; she
delighted in being praised by her lovers for her

<pb n="21"/>

beauty; she took eagerly any presents that were
offered; and she would let her wealthy lovers sit
close beside her, but would not even look at those
who were poor. And often when she exposed her
throat as if by accident, I saw gold necklaces thicker
than shackles. Qn observing all this I would withdraw at once, pitying, as you may well believe, those
poor unfortunates whom she was leading, not by the
nose, but by the beard, and who, like Ixion, embraced but a phantom and not Hera.

@
PLATO
You are right in one point: the door is not
conspicuous and not known to all. However, there
will be no need to go to her house. We shall wait
for her here in the Potters’ Quarter. She will come
here presently, no doubt, on her way back from the
Academy, to stroll in the Painted Porch also, for
it is her custom to do so every day. In fact, here
she comes now. Do you see her, the mannerly one,
the one in the mantle, soft of eye, walking slowly,
rapt in thought?
FRANKNESS
I see many who are alike in mantle, walk, and
fashion. Yet surely only one, even among then, is
the true Philosophy.
PLATO
Right, but she will show you who she is, just by
speaking.

@

PHILOSOPHY
Ah! What are you all doing in the upper world,
Plato and Chrysippus and Aristotle and the rest of
2I
<pb n="23"/>

you, the very fore-front of my studies? Why have
you come back to life? Did anything in the underworld ‘distress you? You certainly appear to be
angry. And who is this man whom you have taken
into custody? Some ghoul or murderer or profaner
of holiness, I suppose.
PLATO
“Yes, indeed, Philosophy, the most impious of all
profaners, for he made bold to speak ill of you, than
whom nothing is more holy, and of us, one and all,
who learned something from you and have left it to
those who came after us.
PHILOSOPHY
Then it made you angry to be vituperated ? And
yet you knew that in spite of the hard names which
Comedy calls me during the festival of Dionysus, I have
held her my friend, and neither sued her at law nor
berated her in private, but permit her to make the
fun that is in keeping and customary at the festival.
I am aware, you see, that no harm can be done by a
joke; that, on the contrary, whatever is beautiful
shines brighter and becomes more conspicuous, like
gold cleansed by its minting. But you, for some
reason or other, have grown hot-tempered and violent.
Tell me, why do you throttle him?
PLATO
"Obtaining leave of absence for this one day, we
came to get him, so that he may pay the penalty for
what he has done; for rumours repeatedly told us
what sort of language he used in public against us.

@

PHILOSOPHY
Then you intend to put him to death before
trial, without even a chance to defend himself? It
is certainly clear that he wants to make.a statement.

<pb n="25"/>

PLATO
No: we have referred the whole matter to you,
and you are to conclude the trial as you think best.
PHILOSOPHY
You, there, what do you say?
FRANKNESS
Precisely what they do, my Lady Philosophy ; for.
you, even without aid, could discover the truth. In
fact, it was only with difficulty, after a deal of
entreaty, that I secured the reservation of the case
for you.
PLATO
Now, you scoundrel, you call her “My Lady,” do
you? Just the other day you made her out to be .
utterly contemptible by offering every form of her
doctrines for sale at two obols apiece before so large
an audience!
PHILOSOPHY
Careful! Perhaps fis abuse was not directed
against Philosophy, but against impostors who do
much that is vile in oyr name.
FRANKNESS
You shall see at once, if you will only hear my
defence.
PHILOSOPHY
Let us go to the Areopagus, or-rather, to the
Acropolis itself, so that at the same time we may
get a bird’s eye view of everything in the city.

@

You, my dears, may walk about in the Painted
Porch meanwhile: I shall join you after concluding
the trial.
FRANKNESS
Who are they, Philosophy? They too seem very
mannerly.

<pb n="27"/>

PHILOSOPHY
This one with the masculine air is Virtue;
yonder is Temperance, and there beside her Justice ;
the one in advance is Culture, and she that is faint
and indistinct in colour is Truth.
FRANKNESS
I do not see which one you really mean.
PHILOSOPHY
Do you not see the unadorned one over there,
naked, always shrinking into the background and
slipping away? :
FRANKNESS
I can just see her now. But why not bring them
also, in order that the meeting may be full and
perfect? As to Truth, indeed, I wish to introduce
her into the trial as an advocate.
PHILOSOPHY
To be sure. (To the others) Come with us also.
It is not a hard matter to try a single case,
particularly one that will involve our own interests.

@
TRUTH
You others go: I do not-need to hear what I
have long known all about.
PHILOSOPHY
But it would help us, Truth, if you should join in
the trial and give us information on each point.
TRUTH

PHILOSOPHY
Yes, indeed, as many as you wish.

TRUTH
Come with us, Liberty and Free-speech, so that
we may be able to rescue this poor creature, our
admirer, who is facing danger for no just reason.
You, Investigation, may stay where you are.
FRANKNESS
Hold, my lady: let him come too, if anyone is to
come. Those whom I shall have to fight to-day are
none of your ordinary cattle, but pretentious
fellows, hard to argue down, always finding some
loophole or other, so that Investigation is necessary.
INVESTIGATION
Yes, most necessary: and you had better take
Proof along too. :
TRUTH
Come, all of you, since you appear to be necessary
to the case.
@
PLATO
Do you see that? He is suborning Truth against
us, Philosophy.
PHILOSOPHY
Then you, Plato and Chrysippus and Aristotle,
are afraid that she, Truth, may tell some lie ‘in his
behalf?
PLATO
It isn’t that, but he is terribly unprincipled and
smooth-tongued, so that he will seduce her.

<pb n="31"/>

PHILOSOPHY
Have no fear. No injustice will be done while we
have Justice here with us. 

@
Let us go up, then.
But tell me, what is your name ? 
FRANKNESS
Mine?  Frankness, son of Truthful, son of
Renowned Investigator.
PHILOSOPHY
And your country?
FRANKNESS
I am a Syrian, Philosophy, from the banks of the
Euphrates. But what of that? I know that some
of my opponents here are just as foreign-born as I:
but in their manners and culture they are not like
men of Soli or Cyprus or Babylon or Stageira.1 Yet
as far as you are concerned it would make no difference even if a man’s speech were foreign, if only his
way of thinking were manifestly right and just.

@
PHILOSOPHY
True: it was a needless question, tobe sure. But
what is your calling? That at least is worth
knowing. 
FRANKNESS
Iam a bluff-hater, cheat-hater, liar-hater, vanityhater, and hate all that sort of scoundrels, who are
very numerous, as you know. 
PHILOSOPHY
Heracles! You follow a hateful calling !
1 Although they were born there: Chrysippus in Soli,
Aristotle in Stageira. No philosopher. mentioned: by name
in this piece came from Cyprus or from Babylon, and these
allusions are not clear. Perhaps Lucian has in mind Zeno
of Citium and Poseidonius of Seleucia on the Tigris.

<pb n="33"/>

FRANKNESS
You are right. You see, in fact, how many have
come to dislike me and how I am imperilled because
I follow it.
However, I am very well up in the opposite
calling, too: I mean the one with love for a base ;
for I am a truth-lover, a beauty-lover, a simplicitylover, and a lover of all else that is kindred to love.
But there are very few who deserve to have this
calling practised upon them, while those who come
under the other and are closer akin to hatefulness
number untold thousands. So the chances are
that by this time I have lost my skill in the pne
calling for lack of practice, but have become very
expert in the other.
PHILOSOPHY
But that ought not to be so, for if a man can do
the one, they say, he can do the other. So do not
distinguish the two callings; they are but one,
though they seem two.
FRANKNESS
You know best as to that, Philosophy. For my
part, however, I am so-constituted as to hate rascals
and to commend and love honest men.

@

PHILOSOPHY
Come, now, since we are where we planned to be,
let us hold our court somewhere hereabouts in the
portico of Our Lady of the Citadel.1 Priestess,
arrange the benches for us. Let us in the meantime
pay our homage to the goddess. 
1 Athena Polias, who shared with Erechtheus the temple
now known as the Erechtheum.

FRANKNESS
Lady of the Citadel, come to my aid against the
pretenders, remembering how many oaths thou dost
hear them make and break each day, and what they
do thou alone seest, dwelling as thou dost upon a
lookout. Now is thine hour to requite them. If
thou seest that I am being overborne, and that the
black ballots are more than the half, add thou thine
own and set me free.1

PHILOSOPHY
Well and good. Here we are for you, gentlemen,
all seated in readiness to hear the speeches. Choose
one of your number who in your opinion can best
conduct the prosecution, and when you have done so,
build up your complaint and establish your charge ;
it is not feasible for all to speak at once. You,
Frankness, shall make your defence thereafter.
PLATO Which. of us, I wonder, would be the best fitted
to handle the case?
CHRYSIPPUS
You, Plato. Marvellous sublimity, superlatively
Attic elegance, charm and _ persuasiveness, insight,
subtlety, opportune seductiveness in demonstration—
all this is yours to the full. Accept the spokesmanship, therefore, and say whatever is appropriate
in behalf of us all. Remember now all your former
successes and put together any points you have urged
against Gorgias or Polos or Hippias or Prodicus: this
man is more able than they. So apply a light
1 Frankness aske of Athena more aid than she generally
gave ; for the proverbial ballot of Athena merely decided a
tie vote in favour of the defendant, as in the trial of Orestes.

his winged car” would be angry if this man should

PLATO
No, let us make use of someone more strenuous—
Diogenes here, or Antisthenes, or Crates, or you
yourself, Chrysippus. For surely what the occasion
demands now is not elegance and literary distinction,
but some degree of argumentative and forensic
equipment: Frankness is a professional speaker.
DIOGENES
Well, then, I will be prosecutor, for we shall not
require speeches of any great length, I suppose: and
besides, I have been insulted beyond all of you, since
I was auctioned off the other day for two obols.
PLATO
Diogenes will make the speech, Philosophy, for all
of us. Remember, friend, not just to speak for
yourself in the complaint, but to keep our common
interests in view. If we do disagree with one
another a little in our doctrines, you must not
examine into that, or attempt to say who is the
nearer right, but, in general, make an impassioned
plea for Philosophy herself, because she has been
heaped with insult and shamefully abused in the
dialogues of Freespeaker ; ignore the personal views
wherein we differ, and fight for what we all have
in common. Take note, you are our sole representative and it rests with you whether all our teachings
are to seem worthy of high reverence or to be thought
no better than this man made them out to be.

DIOGENES
Do not be alarmed ; we shall not come short: I
will speak in behalf of all. Even if Philosophy,
swayed by his eloquence—for she is naturally kindly
and gentle—determines to acquit him, I for my part
shall not be found wanting, for I will show him that
we do not carry sticks for nothing !
PHILOSOPHY
Not by .any means! Use arguments, rather, for
that is better. Butdo notdelay. The water already
has been poured in,1 and the jury has its eyes upon
you.
FRANKNESS
Let the others2 take seats, Philosophy, and cast
their votes with your company, and let Diogenes be
the only prosecutor.
PHILOSOPHY
Then are you not afraid they may find you guilty ?
FRANKNESS
Not at all. In fact, I wish to win by a larger
majority.
PHILOSOPHY
That is handsome of you. Well, then, take your
seats, and you, Diogenes, begin your speech.

@

DIOGENES
What sort of men we were in life, Philosophy, you
know right well, and I need not discuss that point
at all; for who is not aware how much beauty was
brought into life by Pythagoras here, Plato, Aristotle,
Chrysippus and the others, to say nothing of myself?

I shall proceed to speak of the insults which, in spite
of our merit, this double-dyed scoundrel Frankness
has dealt us.
He is a public speaker, they say: but abandoning
the courts and the successes to be gained therein, he
concentrated upon us all thé eloquence and power
that he had acquired .in rhetoric, and not only
unceasingly abuses us himself by calling us cheats
and liars, but induces the public to laugh and sneer
at us as if we amounted to nothing at all. More
than that, he has at last made people actually hate
you, Philosophy, as well as us by dubbing your
doctrines stuff and nonsense and rehearsing in
mockery all that is most serious in what you taught
us, so as to get applause and praise from his audience
for himself and contumely for us. The common sort
are that way by nature; they delight in jesters and
buffoons, and most of all when they criticise what is
held in high reverence. Just so in days gone by
they took delight in Aristophanes and Eupolis, who
brought Socrates on the stage to make fun of him
and got up monstrous farces about him.
The playwrights, however, showed their boldness
against only one man, and at the Dionysia, when it
was’ permissible to do so, and the joking was
considered part of the holiday, and
<quote><l>The god, who loves his joke, no doubt was pleased.1</l></quote>

myself,and in a word, one and all, without the sanction
of a holiday and without having. had anything done
to him personally by us. He would have some excuse
for the thing, of course,if he had acted in self-defence
instead of starting the quarrel.</p>

<p>
What is worst of all, in doing this sort of thing,
Philosophy, he shelters himself under your name,
and he has suborned Dialogue, our serving-man, employing him against us as a helper and a spokesman.
Moreover, he has actually bribed Menippus,1a comrade
of ours, to take part in his farces frequently ; he is
the only one who is not here and does not join us
in the prosecution, thereby playing traitor to our
common cause.

@

For all this he ought to be punished. What, pray,
can he have to say for himself after ridiculing all that
is most holy before so many witnesses? In fact, it
would be a good thing for them, too, if they were to
see him punished, so that no other man might ever
again sneer at Philosophy; for to keep quiet and
pocket insults might well be thought to betoken
weakness and simplicity rather than self-control.
And who could put up with his last performances ?
Bringing us like slaves to the auction-room and
appointing a crier, he sold us off, they say, some for
a high price, some for an Attic mina, and me, arrant
scoundrel that he is, for two obols! And those
present laughed!</p>

<p>
On account of this, we ourselves have come up
here in a rage, and we think it right that you for
your part should avenge us because we have been
insulted to the limit.

Good, Diogenes! You have splendidly said all
that you ought on behalf of us all.
PHILOSOPHY
Stop applauding! Pour in the water for the
defendant. Now, Frankness, make your speech in
turn, for the water now is running for you. Don’t
delay, then.

@

FRANKNESS
Diogenes did not complete the complaint against
me, Philosophy. He left out, for some reason or
other, the greater part of what I said, and everything
that was very severe. But I am so far from denying.
that I said it all and from appearing with a studied
defence that whatever he passed over in silence or
I neglected previously to say, I purpose to include
now. In that way you can find out whom I put up
for sale and abused, calling them pretenders and
cheats. And I beg you merely to note throughout
whether what I say about them is true. If my
speech should prove to contain anything shocking
or offensive, it is not I, their critic, but they, I think,
whom you would justly blame for it, acting as
they do.</p>

<p>
As soon as I perceived how many disagreeable
attributes a public speaker must needs acquire, such
as chicanery, lying, impudence, loudness of mouth,
sharpness of elbow, and what all besides, I fled from
all that, as was natural, and set out to attain your
high ideals, Philosophy, expecting to sail, as it
were, out of stormy waters into a peaceful haven

<pb n="47"/>

and to live out the rest of my life under your
protection.

@

Hardly had I caught a glimpse of “your doctrines
when I conceived admiration for you, as was inevitable,
and for all these men, who are the lawgivers of the
higher life and lend a helping hand to those who
aspire to it by giving advice which is extremely good
and extremely helpful if one does not act contrary to
it or falter, but fixedly regards the principles which
you have established and tries to bring his life into
harmony and agreement with them—a thing, to be
sure, which very few, even of your own disciples, do !1

@
When I saw, however, that many were not in love
with Philosophy, but simply coveted the reputation
of the thing, and that although in all the obvious,
commonplace matters which anyone can easily copy
they were very like worthy men (in beard, I mean,
and walk and garb), in their life and actions, however, they contradicted their outward appearance
and reversed your practice and sullied the dignity of
the profession, I became angry. The case seemed
to me to be as if some actor in tragedy who was
soft and womanish should act the part of Achilles
or Theseus, or even Heracles himself, without either
walking or speaking as a hero should, but showing
off airs and graces in a mask of such dignity. Even
Helen or Polyxena would never suffer such a man
to resemble them too closely, let alone Heracles, the
conquering hero, who, in my opinion, would very soon
1 I give Fritzsche’s interpretation of this last clause,
though I fear it strains the Greek and is foreign to Lucian’s
thought. Another, and I think a better, solution is to excise
the clause as an early gloss, reading jas and interpreting it
more naturally, “a thing which very few, even in our own
time, do.” Compare the late gloss in 8: 17) raita rots nad
Huas Zoe povdxors.

smash both man and mask with a few strokes of his
club for making him out so disgracefully effeminate.

@

Just so with me; when I saw you so treated by
those others, I could not brook the shame, of their
impersonation when they made bold, though but apes,
to wear heroic masks, or to copy the ass of Cumae
who put on a lion’s skin and claimed to be himself a
lion, braying in a very harsh and fearsome way at the
ignorant Cumaeans, until at length a foreigner, who
had often seen lions and asses, exposed him and
chased him away by beating him with sticks.</p>

<p>
But what seemed to me most shocking, Philosophy,
was this, that if people saw any one of these fellows
engaged in any wicked or unseemly or indecent
practice, every man of them at once laid the blame
upon Philosophy herself, and upon Chrysippus or
Plato or Pythagoras or whichever one of you
furnished that sinner with a name for himself and a
model for his harangues; and from him, because he
was leading an evil life, they drew sorry conclusions
about you others, who died long ago. For as you were
not alive, he could not be compared with you. You
were not there, and they all clearly saw him following
dreadful and discreditable practices, so that you
suffered judgment by default along with him and
became involved in the same scandal.
@
I could not endure this spectacle, but set about
exposing them and distinguishing them from you ;
and you, who ought to reward me for it, bring me
into court! Then if I observed one of the initiates
disclosing the mysteries of the Goddesses Twain and
rehearsing them in public, and became indignant and
showed him up, would you consider me the impious

<pb n="51"/>

one: It would not be just. Certainly the officials
of the games always flog an actor if he takes the part
of Athena or Poseidon or Zeus and does not play it
well and in accordance with the dignity of the gods ;
and the gods themselves are surely not angry at them
for letting the scourgers whip a man. wearing their
masks and dressed in their clothing. On the contrary,
they would be gratified, I take it, if he were flogged
more soundly. Not to act a servant’s or a messenger’s part cleverly is a trivial fault, but not to present
Zeus or Heracles to the spectators worthily—Heaven
forfend! how shameful ! 

@

It is most extraordinary, too, that most of them
are thoroughly up in your writings, but live as if they
read and studied them simply to practise the reverse.
Their book tells them they must despise wealth and
reputation, think that only what is beautiful is good,
be free from anger, despise these people of eminence,
and talk with them as man to man; and its advice
is beautiful, as Heaven is my witness, and wise and
wonderful, in all truth. But they teach these very
doctrines for pay, and worship the rich, and are agog
after money; they are more quick-tempered than curs,
more cowardly than hares, more servile than apes,
more lustful than jackasses, more thievish than cats,
more quarrelsome than game-cocks. Consequently,
they let themselves in for ridicule when they hustle


<pb n="53"/>

after it all and elbow one another at the portals of the
rich and take part in great banquets, where they pay
vulgar compliments, stuff themselves beyond decency,
grumble openly at their portions, vent their philosophy disagreeably and discordantly over their cups,
and fail to carry their drink well. All those present
who are not of the profession laugh at them,
naturally, and spit philosophy to scorn for breeding
up such beasts.

@

Most shameless of all, though each one of them
says he needs nothing and bawls it abroad that only
the wise man is rich, after a little he presents
himself and asks for something, and is angry if he
does not get it. It is just as if someone in royal
robes, with a high turban and a diadem and all the
other marks of kingly dignity, should play the
mendicant, begging of men worse off than himself.</p>

<p>
When they must needs receive a present, there is a
great deal of talk to the effect that a man should be
ready to share what he has, and that money does not
matter: “What, pray, does gold or silver amount
to, since it’ is not in any way better than pebbles
on the sea-shore!”” But when someone in want
of help, an old-time comrade and friend, goes and
asks for a little of their plenty, he encounters silence,
hesitancy, forgetfulness, and complete recantation
of doctrines. Their numerous speeches about friendship, their “virtue’”’ and their “honour” have all
gone flying off, I know not whither, winged words
for certain, idly bandied about by them daily in their
class-rooms.

@
 Each of them is your friend as long
as silver and gold are not in sight on the table;
but if you merely give them a glimpse of an obol,

everywhere, the pages of their books have become
blank, and Virtue has taken to her heels. So it is
with dogs, when you toss a bone among them; they
spring to their feet and begin biting each other and
barking at the one that was first to snatch the bone.</p>

<p>
It is said, too, that a king of Egypt once taught
apes to dance, and that the animals, as they are very
apt at imitating human ways, learned quickly and
gave an exhibition, with purple mantles about them
and masks on their faces. For a long time the show,
they say, went well, until a facetions spectator,
having nuts in his pocket, tossed them into the midst.
On catching sight of them, the monkeys forgot their
dance, changed from artists of the ballet to the
simians that they really were, smashed their masks,
tore their costumes, and fought with each other for
the nuts; whereby the carefully planned ballet was
entirely broken up, and was laughed at by the
spectators.

@

These self-styled philosophers do just that, and I
for my part abused their sort, and shall never
stop criticizing and ridiculing them. But as for you
and those who resemble you—for there are, there are
some who truly cultivate philosophy and abide by
your laws—may I never be so insane as to say anything abusive or unkind of you! What could I say?
What is there of that nature in the lives that you
have led? But those pretenders and miscreants
deserve in my opinion to be hated. Come, now,
Pythagoras, Plato, Chrysippus, Aristotle—what do
you say? Have their sort anything to do with you,

their roles, but as things are, it would be easier for a

Stand aside, Frankness ; still farther ... What are
we to do? What did you think of the man’s speech ?
TRUTH
For my part, Philosophy, while he was speaking I
prayed that I might sink into the earth, so true was
everything that he said. In fact, as I listened, I
recognized each of the men who act that way and
applied his remarks to them: “That refers to this
man; so-and-so does that.” In short, he portrayed
the gentlemen to the life, as in a painting, accurate
likenesses in every respect, depicting not only their
persons, but their very souls‘as faithfully as could be.

also; and whoever displays a Jong beard shall receive
a basket of figs into the bargain. Never mind temperance or justice or self-control, as these qualities

PHILOSOPHY
Enough of fishing, Frankness. One of them—
there are many capable of it—may snatch off the gold
and the hook and make away with them, and then
you will have to settle with the priestess. So let
us go away to take our stroll, and as for you (to the.
Philosophers), it is high time you went where you
came from, that you may not overstay your leave.

It shall be done, Philosophy. Good-bye, gentlemen. Let us go down into the town, Investigation,
and carry out our orders.

Where shall we go first? To the Academy, or to
the Porch? Or shall we begin with the Lyceum ?
FRANKNESS
It will make no difference. I am sure, however,
that wherever we go we shall need few crowns of
olive, but many brands.

<div type="translation" n="tlg0062.tlg026">
<head>THE DOUBLE INDICTMENT<note><p>Again we have a reply to criticism, this time largely of an
aesthetic nature. Lucian had been assailed from both sides,
by the rhetoricians for abandoning speech-making and essay writing and going over to dialogue, consecrated, since Plato’s
time, to the service of Philosophy, and by the philosophers
for not handling dialogue in the traditional way. It is the
usual reception accorded to innovators. Lucian’s response
is characteristically novel and effective. Using the form
which he is censured for employing in precisely the way
that he is censured for employing it, he insinuates himself
into the favour of his audience by taking them first to
Heaven to overhear a conversation between Zeus and
Hermes, then in company with Hermes and Justice to the
Areopagus, where Justice, after a brief and amusing colloquy
with Pan, presides over a series of mock-trials (always a
delectable entertainment to Greeks), culminating in the two
that give the piece its name, Lucian v. Oratory and Lucian
v. Dialogue, from which his audience is delighted to see him
come off triumphant. The result is that rhetoric and philosophy à la mode, who have brought him before the bar of
public opinion, are laughed out of court.</p>

<p>
The Dialogue was composed, Lucian tells us (§ 32), when
he was about forty years old, therefore probably not far from
the year 165 A.D.</p></note></head>

ZEUS
Plague take all philosophers who say that bliss is
to be found only among the gods! If they but
knew all that we endure for the sake of men, they
would not envy us our nectar and ambrosia, putting
their trust in Homer, a blind man and a fraud, who
called us blissful and told about what is in heaven
when he could not even see what is on earth. Here
is an example right at hand: Helius puts his team to
his chariot and traverses the sky all day long, clad in
a garment of fire and resplendent with rays, not even
getting leisure enough to scratch his ear, as they say :
for if he unconsciously relaxes the least bit, his horses
run away, turn out of the road, and burn everything
up. Selene, too, goes about without a wink of sleep,
giving light to night-roisterers and people returning
late from dinners. Apollo, again, has taken up a
very active profession, and has been deafened
almost completely by people besetting him with
requests for prophecies. One moment he has to be
in Delphi; the next, he runs to Colophon; from
there he crosses to Xanthus, and again at full speed

<pb n="87"/>

to Delos or to Branchidae. In a word, wherever his
prophetess, after drinking from the holy well and
chewing laurel and setting the tripod ashake, bids
him appear, there is no delaying—he must present
himself immediately to reel off his prophecies, or
else it is all up with his reputation in the profession.
I say nothing of the devices they get up to test his
powers of divination, cooking mutton and turtle
together, so that if he had not a good nose, that
Lydian would have gone off laughing at him.1 As
for Asclepius, he is pestered by the sick: “Dire
sights he sees, and touches what he loathes, and
in the woes of others finds a crop of sorrow for
himself.”2 Why should I refer either to the Winds,
that aid the crops and speed the ships on their
courses and blow upon the winnowers, or to Sleep,
that wings his way to everyone, or to Jack-of-dreams,
that keeps vigil all night long with Sleep and serves
as his interpreter? All this work the gods do out
of love for man, each contributing to life on earth.

@

And yet the others are not so badly off in
comparison with myself. I am the monarch and
father of all: but how many discomforts I put up
with and how many bothers I have, distracted as I
am by such a number of things to think of! First,
I must oversee the work of all the other gods who
help me in any way in administering my sovereignty,
in order that they may not be remiss in it. Then
I myself have to do any number of tasks that are
almost impossible to carry out on account of their
minuteness; for it is not to be supposed that I

to see which oracle was-the most trustworthy (Herod. 1,46-40.

<pb n="89"/>

simply manage and direct in person the principal
features of my administration, such as rain, hail, wind,
and lightning, and that then I am through, being
dispensed from thinking of details. No, not only
must I do all that, but I must look in all directions
at the same time and keep an eye on everybody,
just like the herdsman at Nemea,1 to see who is
stealing, who is committing perjury, who is offering
sacrifice, whether anybody has poured a drinkoffering, from what quarter the steam and the smoke
of burnt-offerings rise, who has called upon me in
sickness or at sea. What is most laborious of all,
at one and the same moment I must attend the
great sacrifice at Olympia, keep an eye on the armies
at war near Babylon, send hail in the country of the
Getae, and attend a banquet among the Ethiopians.
At that, it is not easy to escape criticism. It often
happens that the others, “the gods and the warriors
crested with horse-tails,” sleep all through the night,
while I, though Zeus, am not “held in the sweetness
of slumber,” 2 for if I drowse off, even for an instant,
Epicurus is instantly confirmed in his assertion that
we exercise no providence over what happens on
earth. And we cannot make light of the danger if
men are going to take his word for this’: our temples
will have no wreaths, our wayside shrines no savoury
steam, our wine-bowls no drink-offerings, our altars
will be cold, and in short there will be general
dearth of sacrifices and oblations, and famine
will be rife. For that reason, like the master of
a ship, I stand by myself high up on the stern with
the tiller in my hands, and everybody else aboard
gets drunk, perhaps, and goes to sleep, whereas I,

@
So I should like to
ask the philosophers, who say that only the gods are
happy, when they suppose we really find leisure for
our nectar and our ambrosia in the midst of our
countless bothers. 
Now, here is a case in point: for lack of spare
time we are keeping all these stale lawsuits filed
away, already spoiled by mildew and spiders’ webs,
especially those brought against certain persons
by the sciences and the arts—some of these are very
antiquated.2 People are making an outcry on all
sides and losing patience and hurling reproaches at
Justice.and blaming me for my slowness, not knowing that the hearings have not been postponed,
as it happens, on account of our negligence, but on
account of the bliss in which they imagine we exist :
for that is what they call our press of business.

@

HERMES
I myself hear a great many complaints of that sort
on earth, Zeus, but I did not venture to mention them
to you. Now, however, I shall do so, as you began
the discussion of this topic. They are indeed out of
patience and indignant, father, and although they do
not venture to talk openly, they put their heads
together and grumble, finding fault with the delay.
These men should have known long ago how things
stood with them and should have acquiesced in the
verdict in each case.
ZEUS
Well, what do you think, Hermes? Shall we open
a session.of court for them, or do you wish we should
announce it for next year ?
1 Iliad 2,3, 
2 What these are becomes clear later (p. 109).

<pb n="93"/>

HERMES
No, indeed ; let us open it now.
ZEUS
Do so. Fly down and proclaim that there will be
a session of court under the following regulations.
All who have entered suit are to come to the Areopagus to-day; at that place Justice is to empanel
juries for them out of the entire body of Athenians,
the number of jurymen to depend upon the penalty
involved ; and if anyone thinks that his hearing has
been unjust, he is to be allowed to appeal to me and
have the case tried afresh, just as if it had not been
tried at all. (Zo Justice) Daughter, take your place
beside the Dread Goddesses,1 empanel the juries and
have an eye on the trials.

@

JUSTICE
Back to earth once more, to be driven off by them
and to flee from the world again because I cannot
stand being laughed at by Injustice ?
ZEUS
You must be of good hope. Certainly by now the
philosophers have persuaded them to regard you
more highly than Injustice; especially the son of
Sophroniscus,2 who praised just dealing to the skies
and declared it the greatest of blessings.
JUSTICE
Truly the very man you mention profited greatly
by his talk about me! He was handed over to the
Eleven, thrown into prison, and drank hemlock, poor
fellow, before he had even paid that cock to

<pb n="95"/>

Asclepius ;1 so much the better of the argument had
his accusers, whose philosophy was directly opposed
to his, and favoured Injustice.

@

ZEUS
The people were still unfamiliar with the teachings of philosophy at that time, and there were few
that pursued it, so it was natural that the juries
inclined towards Anytus and Meletus. But at
present, do not you see how many short cloaks and
staves and wallets there are? On all sides there are
long beards, and books in the left hand, and everybody preaches in favour of you; the public walks
are full of people assembling in companies and in
battalions, and there is nobody who does not want to
be thought a scion of Virtue. In fact, many, giving
up the trades that they had before, rush after the
wallet and the cloak, tan their bodies in the sun to
Ethiopian hue, make themselves extemporaneous
philosophers out of cobblers or carpenters, and go 
about praising you and your virtue. Consequently,
in the words of the proverb, it would be easier for a
man to fall in a boat without hitting a plank than
for your eye to miss a philosopher wherever it looks.

@

JUSTICE
Yes, but those very men frighten me, Zeus, by
quarrelling with each other and showing unfairness
even in their discussions of me. It is rumoured,
too, that while most of them claim kinship with me
in words, when it comes to facts they do not even
open their house to me at all, but make it plain that
they will lock me out if ever I come to their door ;
for they made Injustice their bosom friend long ago.
1 His last words were: “Crito, we owe a cock to
Asclepius. Do pay it without fail.” (End of Phaedo).

<pb n="97"/>

ZEUS
They are not all bad, my daughter, and it is
enough if you find some that are good. But go now,
so that a few cases, at least, may be heard to-day.

@


HERMES
Let us set out in this direction, Justice, straight for
Sunium, not far from the foot of Hymettus, to the left
of Parnes, where you see those two heights1; you
have probably forgotten the way long since. But why
are you crying and taking it hard? Don't be afraid:
things are no longer the same in life. All those
Scirons and Pinebenders and Busirises and Phalarises
whom you used to fear in former days are dead, and
now Wisdom and the Academy and the Porch are
in full sway, seek for you everywhere, and hold
conversations about you, in open-mouthed expectation that, from some quarter or other, you may
perhaps come flying down to them once more.
JUSTICE
Well, Hermes, you are the only person who can
tell me the truth, inasmuch as you associate with
them a great deal, passing your days with them in
the athletic clubs and in the market-place; for you
are the god of the market, as well as being crier in
the meetings of the assembly. What sort’of people
are they, and is it possible for me to abide among
them?
HERMES
To be sure; I should not be treating you fairly if
I did not tell you, since you are my sister. Most of

and Justice are coming down from above, and from seaward

Olympus or Ida.

them have been helped not a little by philosophy:
for if it goes no further, at least regard for their
cloth makes them more circumspect in sinning.
However, you will come upon a few rascals among
them—I must tell the truth, I suppose—and some who
are partly wise and partly foolish. You see, when
Wisdom took them in hand and dyed them over, all
those who thoroughly absorbed the dye were made
entirely serviceable, without any intermixture of
other hues, and they are quite ready to receive you ;
while those who because of their ingrained filth
were not deeply penetrated by the colouring matter
of the dyestuff are better than the rest, to be sure,
but unfinished products, half-white, blemished, and
spotted like the pard. And there are some who
have only touched the kettle on the outside with
a finger-tip and smeared on some of the soot, yet
think that they too are well enough dyed over.
You, however, will of course pass your time with
the best of them.

@

But in the course of our talk we are already drawing near to Attica, so let us leave Sunium on our
right, and now let us glide down to the Acropolis.
Now that we have alighted, you sit down here
on the Areopagus somewhere, facing the Pnyx, and
wait until I give out the proclamation from Zeus.
If I climb the Acropolis it will be easier for me to
summon everybody from that point of vantage for
the voice.
JUSTICE
Don’t go, Hermes, until you have told me who
comes here, the person with the horns and the
shepherd’s pipe and the hairy legs.

<pb n="101"/>

HERMES
What! Don’t you know Pan, the most bacchanalian of the servants of Dionysus? He formerly lived
on Parthenion,1 but at the time of the approach of
Datis by sea and the landing of the barbarians at
Marathon, he came unasked to fight on the side of
the Athenians ; and since then, accepting this cavern
under the Acropolis, a little above the Pelasgicon,2
he lives in it, paying the usual tax as a resident
alien. Very likely he has seen us near and is coming
up to greet us.

frolicsome of all satyrs, and at Athens the most
bellicose !

In spite of that, they come up only two or three
times a year, pick out and sacrifice in my honour
a he-goat with a powerful goatish smell, and then
feast on the meat, making me a mere witness of
their good cheer and paying their respects to me
only with their noise. However, their laughter and
fun afford me some amusement.

JUSTICE
In general, Pan, have they been improved in
virtue by the philosophers ?
PAN
What do you mean by philosophers? Those
gloomy fellows, flocking together, with beards like
mine, who talk so much?
JUSTICE
To be sure.
PAN
I do not know at all what they mean and_I do not
understand their wisdom, for I am a mountaineer
and I have not studied those clever, citified, technical
terms, Justice. How could a literary man or a philosopher possibly come from Arcadia? My wisdom
does not go beyond the flute and the pipes ; for the
rest I am a goatherd, a dancer, and if need bea
fighter. However, I hear them bawling continually
and talking about “virtue” (whatever that means)
and “ideas” and “nature” and “things incorporeal,”
terms that are to me unknown and outlandish. They
begin their discussions peaceably, but as the conference proceeds they raise their voices to a high
falsetto, so that, what with their excessive straining
and their endeavour to talk at the same time, their

<pb n="105"/>

faces get red, their necks get swollen, and their veins
stand out like those of flute-players when they try to
blow into a closed flute. In fact, they spoil their
arguments, confuse the original subject of inquiry,
and then, after abusing one another, most of them,
they go away wiping the sweat off their foreheads
with their bent fingers; and the man that is most
loud-mouthed and impudent and leaves last when they
break up is considered to have the best of it. However, the common people admire them, especially
those who have nothing more pressing to do, and
stand there enchanted by their impudence and their
shouting. For my part, I considered them impostors
in consequence of all this, and was annoyed at the
resemblance in beard. But perhaps there was something beneficial to the common weal in their shouting
and some good sprang from those technical terms
of theirs—I can’t say. However, if I am to tell the
truth without any reserve—for I dwell on a look-out,
as you see—I have often seen many of them in the
dark of the evening—

@
JUSTICE
Hush, Pan ; didn’t it seem to you that Hermes is
making a proclamation ?
PAN
Why, yes.
HERMES
Oyez, oyez! Under the blessing of Heaven, we
shall hold a session of court to-day, the seventh of
Elaphebolion.1 All who have entered suits are to come
to the Areopagus, where Justice will empanel the juries
1 The seventh of Elaphebolion was not far from the first
of April.

and be present in person at the trials. The jurors
will be drawn from the entire body of Athenians ;
the pay will be three obols a case, and the number
of jurors will be in accordance with the charge. All
those who have entered suits but have died before
they came to trial are to be sent back to earth by
Aeacus. If anyone thinks he has had an unjust
hearing, he is to appeal the case, and the appeal will
be to Zeus.
PAN
Heavens, what a hubbub! What a shout they
raised, Justice, and how eagerly they are gathering
at a run, dragging each other up the hill, straight for
the Areopagus ! Hermes, too, is here already, so busy
yourselves with the cases, empanel your juries and
give your verdicts as usual; I am going back to the
cave to pipe one of the passionate melodies with ©
which I am in the habit of provoking Echo. I am
sick of trials and speeches, for I hear the pleaders on
the Areopagus every day.

orders are carried out in silence, and the juries are all in
readiness when the first case is called, which is not until she
has filled the docket for the day (§ 15).
2 Polemo, intemperate in his youth, went to a lecture by
Xenocrates to create a disturbance, but was converted to
philosophy by what he heard. He succeeded Xenocrates as
ead of the Academy (Diog. L. iv. 1 ff.).
3 Dionyaius the Convert was a pupil of Zeno, but became
a Cyrenaic, “being converted to pleasure ; for sore eyes gave
him so much trouble that he could not bring himself to

Why, these are of the same nature, and the complaint, although recent, is very like those for which
we have already provided juries, so that it ought to
be tried along with them.

School.

to hinder its being done anonymously.

JUSTICE
Look here, are we really to try cases from over the
border here in Athens, on the Areopagus? They
ought to have been tried on the other side of the
Euphrates. However, draw eleven jurors, the same
to sit for both cases.

in jury-fees.

She says that she cannot plead her case because her
tongue is tied with drink and she is afraid of getting

laughed at in court. She can hardly stand, as you
see.
JUSTICE
Then let her have an advocate appear, one of these
public pleaders. There are plenty of them ready to
split their lungs for three obols !
HERMES
But not one will care to espouse the cause of
Intemperance, not openly, at any rate. However,
this request of hers seems reasonable.
JUSTICE
What request?
HERMES
“The Academy,” she says, “is always ready to
argue on both sides and trains herself to be able to
speak eloquently both pro and con. Therefore let
her plead first for me, and then after that she will
plead for herself.”
JUSTICE
That is unprecedented. Nevertheless, make both
speeches, Academy, since it is easy for you.

@

ACADEMY
Listen first, gentlemen of the jury, to the plea of
Intemperance, as the water now runs for her.
The poor creature has been treated with the
greatest injustice by me, the Academy. She has
been robbed of the only friendly and faithful slave
she had, who thought none of her orders unbecoming,
Polemo yonder, who used to go roistering through
the middle of the square in broad day, who kept
a music-girl’and had himself sung to from morning
to night, who was always drunk and debauched and

<pb n="117"/>

had garlands of flowers on his head. That this: is
true, all the Athenians will testify ; for they never
saw Polemosober. But when the unhappy man went
rollicking to the Academy's door, as he used to go to
everybody's, she claimed him as her slave, snatched
him out of the hands of Intemperance by main
strength, and took him into her house. Then she
forced him to drink water, taught him to keep sober,
stripped off his garlands: and when he ought to have
been drinking at table, she made him study intricate,
gloomy terms, full of profound thought. So, instead
of the flush that formerly glowed upon him, the
poor man has grown pale, and his body is shrivelled ;
he has forgotten all his songs, and he sometimes sits
without food or drink till the middle of the evening,
talking the kind of balderdash that I, the Academy,
teach people to talk unendingly. What is more, he
even abuses Intemperance at my instigation and says
any number of unpleasant things about her.
I have said about all that there is to say for
Intemperance. Now I will speak for myself, and
from this point let the water run for me.
JUSTICE
What in the world will she say in reply to that?
Anyhow, pour in the same amount for her in turn.

@

ACADEMY
Heard casually, gentlemen of the jury, the plea
which the advocate has made in behalf of Intemperance is quite plausible, but if you give an unprejudiced
hearing to my plea also, you will find out that I have
done her no wrong at all.
This man Polemo, who, she « says, is her servant,
was not naturally bad or inclined to Intemperance,

<pb n="119"/>

but had a nature like mine. But while he was still
young and impressionable she preémpted him, with
the assistance of Pleasure, who usually helps her, and
corrupted the poor fellow, surrendering him unconditionally to dissipation and to light women, so
that he had not the slightest remnant of shame. In
fact, what she thoughf€ was said on her behalf a
moment ago, you should consider said on my behalf.
The poor fellow went about from early to late with
garlands on his head, flushed with wine, attended by
music right through the public square, never sober,
making roisterous calls upon everybody, a disgrace to
his ancestors and to the whole city and a laughing-stock to strangers.</p>

<p>
But when he came to my house, it chanced that,
as usual, the doors were wide open and I was
discoursing about virtue and temperance to such of
my friends as were there. Coming in upon us with
his flute and his garlands, first of all he began to shout
and tried to break up our meeting by disturbing it
with his noise. But we paid no attention to him, and
as he was not entirely sodden with Intemperance,
little by little he grew sober under the influence of
our discourses, took off his garlands, silenced his
flute-player, became ashamed of his purple mantle,
and, awaking, as it were, from profound sleep, saw his
own condition and condemned his past life. The flush
that came from Intemperance faded and vanished,
and he flushed for shame at what he was doing. At
length he abandoned her then and there, and took up
with me, not because I either invited or constrained
him, as this person says, but voluntarily, because he
believed the conditions here were better.

Please summon him now, that you may see how he
has fared at my hands.... Taking this man,
gentlemen of the jury, when he was in a ridiculous
plight, unable either to talk or to stand on account
of his potations, I converted him and sobered him
and made him from a slave into a well-behaved,
temperate man, very valuable to the Greeks; and he
himself is grateful to me for it, as are also his
relatives on his account.
I have done. It is for you now to consider which
of us it was better for him to associate with.

speak, I am confident that my plea will be.far more
just than hers.</p>

<p>
As a matter of fact, the present charge is that by
getting herself up in this courtesan style she
beguiled my lover, Dionysius, a respectable man until
then, by the seductiveness of her appearance, and
drew him to herself. Furthermore, the suit which
your predecessors decided between the Academy and
Intemperance was the twin-sister of the present suit.
For the point at issue now is whether we should
live like swine with our noses to the ground in the
enjoyment of pleasure, without a single noble
thought, or whether, considering what is enjoyable —
secondary to what is right, we should follow
philosophy in a free spirit like free men, neither
fearing pain as invincible nor giving preference to
pleasure in a servile spirit and seeking happiness in
honey and in figs. By holding out such bait to silly
people and by making a bogey. out of pain,' my
opponent wins over the greater part of them, and
this poor man is one; she made him run away from
me by keeping an eye upon him until he was ill, for
while he was well he would never have accepted her
arguments.</p>

<p>
After all, why should I be indignant at her? Forsooth, she does not even let the gods alone, but
_slanders their management of afffirs! If you are
wise, then, you will give her a sentence for impiety
also. I hear, too, that she is not even prepared to
plead in person, but will have Epicurus appear as her
illustrating the point that Cicero makes in the T'uscwlans

Heracles and your own1 Theseus would have been if
they had allied themselves to Pleasure and had
shirked pain and toil. Nothing would hinder the
earth from being full of wrong-doing if they had
not toiled painfully.</p>

<p>
This is all I have to say, for I am not at all fond
of long speeches. But if she should consent to let
me put questions and to give a brief reply to each, it
would very soon be evident that she amounts to
nothing. However, remember your oath and vote in
accordance with it now, putting no faith in Epicurus,
who says that the gods take no note of what happens
among us.
JUSTICE
Stand aside. Epicurus, speak for Pleasure.

@

EPICURUS
I shall not address you at length, gentlemen of the
jury, for I myself do not need many words.
If Pleasure had used charms or philtres to constrain Dionysius, whom Stoa claims to be her lover,
to desert Stoa and to centre his regard upon her, she
might fairly have been held a sorceress and might
have been found guilty of using undue influence upon
the lovers of others. But suppose a free man in a
free city, unstopped by the laws, hating the tedium
of life with her and thinking that the happiness
which comes, she says, as the consummation of pain
is stuff and nonsense, made his escape from her
thorny, labyrinthine reasonings and ran away to
Pleasure of his own free will, cutting the meshes of

<pb n="127"/>

her logic as if they weré bonds, because he had the
spirit of a human being, not of a clod, and thought
pain painful, as indeed it is, and pleasure pleasant,
in that case would it have been right to bar him out,
plunging him head over ears into a sea of pain when
he was swimming from a wreck to a haven and
yearned for calm water—to put the poor fellow at the
mercy of her dilemmas in spite of the fact that he
was seeking asylum with Pleasure like a suppliant at
the Altar of Mercy—in order that he might climb
“the steep” with copious sweat, cast eyes upon
that famous Virtue,1 and then, after toiling painfully
his whole life long, be happy when life is over?</p>

<p>
Who should be considered a better judge than this
man himself, who knew the teachings of Stoa if ever
a man did, and formerly thought that only what was
right was good, but now has learnt that pain is bad,
and so has chosen what he has determined to be the
better? He saw, no doubt, that her set make a
great deal of talk about fortitude and endurance
of pain, but privately pay court to Pleasure; that
they are bold as brass in the lecture-room, but live
under the laws of Pleasure at home; that they
are ashamed, of course, to let themselves be seen
“lowering their pitch” and playing false to their
tenets, but suffer the tortures of Tantalus, poor
fellows, so that wherever they think they will be unobserved and can transgress their laws with safety,
they eagerly glut themselves with pleasure. In fact,
if they should be given the ring of Gyges, so that
they could put it on and be unseen, or the Cap of
Darkness, without a doubt they would bid good-bye

to pain for ever and would go crowding after
Pleasure, one and all, imitating Dionysius who, until
he was ill, expected to get some benefit from their
discourses about fortitude, but when he encountered
suffering and illness, and pain came closer home to
him, he perceived that his body was contradicting
Stoa and maintaining the opposite side. So he put
more trust in it than in her set, decided that he was
‘aman, with the body of a man, and thenceforward
treated it otherwise than as if it were a statue, well.

to prove that pleasure and pain are alike “immaterial,” and
neither “approved” nor “disapproved,” because they neither
help nor hinder the effort to attain Virtue.

because they are self-evident and require no proof, were all
hypothetical or disjunctive syllogisms ; examples are: (1)
“if it is day, it is light ; it is light, —> it is day”; (2) “if it
is day, it is light ; it is dark, —> it is not day”; (3) “Plato
is not both dead and alive; he is dead,  —> he is not alive” ;

After all, it was only recently that the writs were

complaint in the way that I have preferred and
chosen. I cannot come to the same conclusion when
I contemplate my own experiences and the speeches
that I hear, for the speeches that he will make to
you will be as like as can be to mine, but his
actions, as you shall see, have gone so far that
measures must be taken to prevent my experiencing
worse injury at his hands1 . . . But not to prolong
my introduction when the water has been running
freely this long time, I will begin my complaint.

@

When this man was a mere boy, gentlemen of the
jury, still speaking with a foreign accent and I might
almost say wearing a caftan in the Syrian style, I
found him still wandering about in Ionia, not
knowing what to do with himself; so I took him in
hand and gave him an education. As it seemed to
me that he was an apt pupil and paid strict attention
to me—for he was subservient to me in those days
and paid court to me and admired none but me—I
turned my back upon all the others who were suing
for my hand, although they were rich and goodlooking and of splendid ancestry, and plighted myself
to this ingrate, who was poor and insignificant and
young, bringing him a considerable dowry consisting
in many marvellous speeches. Then, after we were
married, I got him irregularly registered among my
own clansmen and made him a citizen, so that those who had failed to secure my hand in marriage choked
with envy. When he decided to go travelling in
order to show how happily married he was, I did not

desert him even then, but trailed up and down after
him everywhere and made him famous and renowned
by giving him finery and dressing him out. On our
travels in Greece and in Ionia I do not lay so much
emphasis ; but when he took a fancy to go to Italy,
I crossed the Adriatic with him, and at length I
journeyed with him as far as Gaul, where I made
him rich.</p>

<p>
For a long time he took my advice in everything
and lived with me constantly, never spending a
single night away from home: 

@

but when he had laid
in plenty of the sinews of war and thought that he
was well off for reputation, he became supercilious
and vain and neglected me, or rather deserted
me completely. Having conceived an inordinate
affection for that bearded man in the mantle,
Dialogue, who is said to be the son of Philosophy
and is older than he is, he lives with him. Showing
no sense of shame, he has curtailed the freedom and
the range of my speeches and has confined himself
to brief, disjointed questions: and instead of saying
whatever he wishes in a powerful voice, he fits
together and spells out short paragraphs, for which
he cannot get hearty praise or great applause from
his hearers, but only a smile, or a restrained gesture
of the hand, an inclination of the head, or a sigh to
point his periods. That is the sort of thing this
gallant gentleman fell in love with, despising me!
They say, too, that he is not at peace with this
favourite, either, but insults him in the same way.

<pb n="141"/>
@
Is he not, then, ungrateful and subject to punishment under the laws that concern desertion, inasmuch
as he so disgracefully abandoned his lawful wife,
from whom he received so much and through whom
he is famous, and sought a new arrangement, now
of all times, when I alone am admired and claimed
as patroness by everyone? For my part I hold out
against all those who court me, and when they
knock at my door and call my name at the top
of their lungs, I have no desire either to open or to
reply, for I see that they bring with them nothing
but their voices. But this man even then does not
come back to me: no, he keeps his eyes upon his
favourite. Ye gods, what good does he expect to
get from him, knowing that he has nothing but his
short cloak ?
I have finished, gentlemen of the jury. But I beg
you, if he wishes to make his defence in my style
of speaking, do not permit that, for it -would be
unkind to turn my own weapon against me; let
him defend himself, if he can, in the style of his
favourite, Dialogue.
HERMES
That is unreasonable. It is not possible, Oratory,
for him, all by himself, to make his defence after
Dialogue’s manner. Let him make a speech as
you did.

indignant at the thought of my using a long
speech when I acquired my power of speaking from
her, I shall not say much to you, but shall simply
answer the main points of her complaint and then

<pb n="143"/>

leave it to you to weigh the whole question. In all
that she told about me she told the truth. She
gave me an education and went abroad with me and
had me enfranchized as a Greek, and on this
account, at least, I am grateful to her for marrying
me. Why I left her and took to my friend here,
Dialogue, listen, gentlemen of the jury, and you
shall hear; and do not imagine that I am telling
any falsehood for the sake of advantage.

@

Seeing that she was no longer modest and did not
continue to clothe herself in the respectable way
that she did once when Demosthenes took her to
wife, but made herself up, arranged her hair like a
courtesan, put on rouge, and darkened her eyes
underneath, I became suspicious at once and secretly
took note where she directed her glances. I pass
over everything else, but every night our street was
full of maudlin lovers coming to serenade her,
knocking at the door, and sometimes even
venturing to force an entrance in disorderly fashion.
She herself laughed and enjoyed these performances,
and generally, when she heard them singing lovesongs in a hoarse voice, she either peeped over the
edge of the roof or else even slyly opened the
windows, thinking that I would not notice it, and
then. wantoned and intrigued with them. I could
not stand this, and as I did not think it best to
bring an action for divorce against her on the ground
of adultery, I went to Dialogue, who lived near by,
and requested him to take me in.

For my part, gentlemen of the jury, I should prefer

matter a little at a time, as is my wont. Nevertheless I will make my complaint in the way that is
customary in courts of law, although I am completely
uninformed and inexperienced in such matters. Please
consider this my introduction.
The wrongs done me and the insults put upon me
by this man are these. I was formerly dignified, and
pondered upon the gods and nature and the cycle of
the universe, treading the air1 high up above the
1 In the Clouds of Aristophanes (225) Socrates says: “I
tread the air and contemplate the sun.”

<pb n="147"/>

clouds where “great Zeus in heaven driving his
winged car”1 sweeps on; but he dragged me down
when I was already soaring above the zenith. and
mounting on “heaven’s back,”2 and broke my wings,
putting me on the same level as the common herd.
Moreover, he took away from me the respectable
tragic mask that I had, and put another upon me that
is comic, satyr-like, and almost ridiculous. Then he
unceremoniously permed me up with Jest and Satire
and Cynicism and Eupolis and Aristophanes, terrible
men for mocking all that is holy and scoffing at all
that is right. At last he even dug up and thrust in
upon me Menippus, a prehistoric dog,3 with a very
loud bark, it seems, and sharp fangs, a really dreadful
dog who bites unexpectedly because he grins when
he bites.
Have I not been dreadfully maltreated, when I no
longer occupy my proper réle but play the comedian
and the buffoon and act out extraordinary plots for
him? What is most monstrous of all, I have been

have looked for anything else in the world sooner than
that Dialogue should say such things about. me.
When I took him in hand, he was still dour, as
most people thought, and had been reduced to a
skeleton through continual questions. In that guise
he seemed awe-inspiring, to be sure, but not in
any way attractive or agreeable to the public. So
first of all I got him into the way of walking on the
ground like a human being; afterwards by washing
off all his accumulated grime and forcing him to
smile, I made him more agreeable to those who saw
him: and on top of all that, I paired him with
Comedy, and in this way too procured him great
favour from his hearers, who formerly feared his
prickles and avoided taking hold of him as if he
were a sea-urchin.</p>

<p>
I know, however, what hurts him most. It is
that I do not sit and quibble with him about those
obscure, subtle themes of his, like “whether the soul
is immortal,” and “when God made the world, how
many pints of pure, changeless substance he poured
into the vessel in which he concocted the universe,”1
and “whether rhetoric is the false counterpart of a
subdivision of political science, the fourth form of
parasitic occupation.”2 Somehow he delights in
dissecting such problems, just as people like to scratch
where it itches. Reflection is sweet to him, and he
sets great store by himself if they say that not everyone can grasp his penetrating speculations about
“ideas.”</p>

<p>
That is what he expects of me, naturally ; and he
demands those wings of his and gazes on high without

it goes, he cannot complain, I am sure, that I have
stripped him of that Greek mantle and shifted him
into a foreign one, even though I myself am considered foreign. Indeed I should be doing wrong to
transgress in that way against him. and to steal away
his native costume.

In view of what the dolts do at their sacrifices and
their feasts and processions in honour of the gods,
what they pray for and vow, and what opinions they
hold about the gods, I doubt if anyone is so gloomy
and woe-begone that he will not laugh to see the
idiocy of their actions. Indeed, long before he
laughs, I think, he will ask himself whether he
should call them devout or, on the _ contrary,
irreligious and pestilent, inasmuch as they have
taken it for granted that the gods are so low and
mean as to stand in need of men and to enjoy being
flattered and to get angry when they are slighted.</p>

<p>
Anyhow, the Aetolian incidents—the hardships of
the Calydonians, all the violent deaths, and the dis-
solution of Meleager—were all due, they say, to
Artemis, who held a grudge because she had not
been included in Oeneus’ invitation to his sacrifice ;
so deeply was she impressed by the superiority of
his victims! Methinks I can see her in Heaven
then, left all by herself when the other gods and
goddesses had gone to the house of Oeneus, fussing
and scolding about being left out of such a feast!

So nothing, it seems, that they do is done without
compensation. They sell men their blessings, and one
can buy from them health, it may be, for a calf,
wealth for four oxen, a royal throne for a hundred,
a safe return from Troy to Pylos for nine bulls, and
a fair voyage from Aulis to Troy for a_king’s
daughter! Hecuba, you know, purchased temporary
immunity for Troy from Athena for twelve oxen and
a frock. One may imagine, too, that they have many
things on sale for the price of a cock or a wreath or

Chryses knew this, I suppose, being a priest and an —
old man and wise in the ways of the gods ; so when
he came away from Agamemnon unsuccessful, it was
just as if he had loaned his good works to Apollo;
he took him to task, demanded his due, and all
but insulted him, saying: “My good Apollo, I
have often dressed your temple with wreaths when
it lacked them before, and have burned in your
honour all those thighs of bulls and goats upon your .altars, but you neglect me when I[ am in such straits
and take no account of your benefactor.”1 
Consequently, he so discomfited Apollo by his talk that he

plague, even to their mules and dogs.

Having once alluded to Apollo, I wish to mention
something else that gifted men say about him, not
his misfortunes in love, such as the slaying of
Hyacinthus and the superciliousness of Daphne, but
that when he was found guilty of killing the Cyclopes
and was banished from Heaven on account of it, he
was sent to earth to try the lot of a mortal. On this
occasion he actually became a serf in Thessaly under
Admetus and in Phrygia under Laomedon, where, to
be sure, he was not alone, but had Poseidon with
him ; and both of them were so poor that they had
to make bricks and work upon the wall;1 what is
more, they did not even get full pay from the
Phrygian, who owed them, it is said, a balance of
more than thirty Trojan drachmas !

Is it not true that the poets gravely tell these
tales about the gods, and others, too, far more
hallowed than these, about Hephaestus, Prometheus,
Cronus, Rhea and almost the whole family of Zeus?
Yet, in beginning their poems, they invite the
Muses to join their song! Inspired, no doubt, by
the Muses, they sing that as soon as Cronus had
castrated his father Heaven, he became king there
and devoured his own children, like the Argive
Thyestes in later time; that Zeus, stolen away by
Rhea, who put the stone in his place, and abandoned
in Crete, was nursed by a nanny-goat (just as
1 Of Troy.

<pb n="161"/>

Telephus was nursed by a doe and the Persian, Cyrus
the Elder, by a bitch) and then drove his father out,
threw him into prison, and held the sovereignty
himself; that, in addition to many other wives, he at
last married his sister, following the laws of the
Persians and the Assyrians ; that, being passionate
and prone to the pleasures of love, he soon filled
Heaven with children, some of whom he got by his
equals in station and some illegitimately of mortal,
earthly stock, now turning into gold, this gallant
squire, now into a bull or a swan or an eagle, and in
short, showing himself more changeable than even
Proteus; and that Athena was the only one to be
born of his head, conceived at the very root of his
brain, for as to Dionysus, they say, Zeus took, him
prematurely from his mother while she was still
ablaze, implanted him hastily in his own thigh, and
cut him out when labour came on.

@
Their rhapsodies about Hera are of similar tenor, 
that without intercourse with her husband she
became the mother of a wind-child, Hephaestus, who,
however, is not in great luck, but works at the blacksmith’s trade over a fire, living in smoke most of the
time and covered with cinders, as is natural with a
forge-tender; moreover, he is. not even straightlimbed, as he was lamed py his fall when Zeus threw
him out of Heaven. In fact, if the Lemnians had
not obligingly caught him while he was still in the
air, we should have had our Hephaestus killed just
like Astyanax when he fell from the battlements.1
1 The notion that the Lemnians caught Hephaestus as he
fell is Lucian’s own contribution. He expects his audience
to be aware that he is giving them a sly misinterpretation of
Homer’s ἄφαρ κομίσαντο πεσόντα (Iliad, 1, 594).

<pb n="163"/>

But Hephaestus came off quite well beside Prometheus. Who does not know what happened to him
because he was too philanthropic? Taking him to
Scythia, Zeus pegged him out on the Caucasus and
posted an eagle at his side to peck at his liver every
day.
@

Prometheus, then, received a sentence and served
it out, but what about Rhea ? One must surely speak
of this also. Does not she misconduct herself and
behave dreadfully? Although she is an old woman,
past her best years, the mother of so many gods,
nevertheless she still has a love affair with a boy and
is jealous, and she takes Attis about with her behind
her lions, in spite of the fact that he cannot be of
any use to her now. So how can one find fault with
Aphrodite for being unfaithful to her husband, or
with Selene for going down to visit Endymion time
and again in the middle of her journey?

@

Come, dismissing this topic, let us go up to Heaven
itself, soaring up poet-fashion by the same route as
Homer and Hesiod, and let us see how they have
arranged things on high. That it is bronze on the
outside we learned from Homer, who anticipated us
in saying so. But when one climbs over the edge,
puts up one’s head a little way into the world above,
and really gets up on the “back,”1 the light is
brighter, the sun is clearer, the stars are shinier,
it is day everywhere, and the ground is of gold.
As you go in, the Hours live in the first house, for
they are the warders of the gate; then come Iris
and Hermes, who are attendants and messengers of
Zeus ; next, there is the smithy of Hephaestus, filled
with works of art of every kind, and after that,
1 Plato, Phaedrus 247 B. Cf. p. 147.

<pb n="165"/>

the houses of the gods and the palace of Zeus, all
very handsomely built by Hephaestus. 

@
“The gods,
assembled in the house of Zeus”1—it is in order,
I take it, to elevate one’s diction when one is on
high—look off at the earth and gaze about in every
direction, leaning down to see if they can see fire
being lighted anywhere, or steam drifting up to
them “about the smoke entwined.”2 If anybody
sacrifices, they all have a feast, opening their mouths
for the smoke and drinking the blood that is spilt
at the altars, just like flies; but if they dine at
home, their meal is nectar and ambrosia. In days of
old, men used to dine and drink with them—Ixion
and Tantalus—but as they behaved shockingly and
talked too much, they are still undergoing punishment to this day, and there is now no admission
for human beings to Heaven, which is strictly
private.
@

That is the way the gods live, and as a result, the
practices of men in the matter of divine worship are
harmonious and consistent with all that. First they
fenced off groves, dedicated mountains, consecrated
birds and assigned plants to each god. Then they
divided them up, and now worship them by nations
and claim them as fellow-countrymen ; the Delphians
claim Apollo, and so do. the Delians, the Athenians
Athena (in fact, she proves her kinship by her name),
the Argives Hera, the Mygdonians Rhea, the
Paphians Aphrodite. As for the Cretans, they not
only say that Zeus was born and brought up among
them, but even point out his tomb. We were mistaken all this while, then, in thinking that thunder
1 Iliad 4, 1.
2 Iliad 1, 317.

<pb n="167"/>

and rain and everything else comes from Zeus ; if we
had but known it, he has been dead and buried in
Crete this long time!

@

Then too they erect temples, in order that the
gods may not be houseless and hearthless, of course ;
and they fashion images in their likeness, sending for
a Praxiteles or a Polycleitus or a Phidias, who have
caught sight of them somewhere and represent Zeus
as a bearded man, Apollo as a perennial boy, Hermes
with his first moustache, Poseidon with sea-blue hair
and Athena with green eyes! In spite of all, those
who enter the temple think that what they behold is
not now ivory from India nor gold mined in Thrace,
but the very son of Cronus and Rhea, transported to
earth by Phidias and bidden to be overlord of deserted Pisa, thinking himself lucky if he gets a
sacrifice once in four long years as an incident to
the Olympic games.
@

When they have established altars and formulae
and lustral rites, they present their sacrifices, the
farmer an ox from the plough, the shepherd a lamb,
the goatherd a goat, someone else incense or a cake ;
the poor man, however, propitiates the god by Just
kissing his own hand.1 But those who offer victims
(to come back to them) deck the animal with garlands, after finding out far in advance whether it is
perfect or not, in order that they may not kill something that is ef no use to them; then they bring it to
the altar and slaughter it under the god’s eyes, while
it bellows plaintively—making, we must suppose,
auspicious sounds, and fluting low music to accompany the sacrifice! Who would not suppose that
1 Cf. Saltat. 17.

<pb n="169"/>

the gods like to see all this? And although the
notice says that no one is to be allowed within the
holy-water who has not clean hands, the priest
himself stands there all bloody, just like the Cyclops
of old, cutting up the victim, removing the entrails,
plucking out the heart, pouring the blood about the
altar, and doing everything possible in the way of
piety. To crown it all, he lights a fire and puts upon
it the goat, skin and all, and the sheep, wool and all ;
and the smoke, divine and holy, mounts upward and
gradually dissipates into Heaven itself.</p>

<p>
The Scythians, indeed, reject all the sacrificial
animals and think them too mean; they actually
offer men to Artemis and by so doing gratify the
goddess !
@

These practices are all very well, no doubt, and
also those of the Assyrians and those of the Phrygians
and Lydians; but if you go to Egypt, then, ah! then
you will see much that is venerable and truly in
keeping with Heaven—Zeus with the head of a ram,
good Hermes with the head of a dog, Pan completely metamorphosed into a goat, some other god
into an ibis, another into a crocodile, another into a
monkey !

<pb n="171"/>

on the eve of the war, the revolt of the giants, the
gods were panic-stricken and came to Egypt, thinking
that surely there they could hide from their enemies ;
and then one of them in his terror entered into a
goat, another into. a ram, and others into other
beasts or birds; so of course the gods still keep the
forms they took then. All this, naturally, is on
record in the temples, having been committed to
writing more than ten thousand years ago!

@

Sacrifices are the same there as with us, except
that they mourn over the victim, standing about it
and beating their breasts after it has been slain. In
some cases they even bury it after simply cutting its
throat.</p>

<p>
And if Apis, the greatest of their gods, dies, who
is there who thinks so much of his hair that he does
not shave it off and baldly show his mourning on
his head, even if he has the purple tress of Nisus?1
But Apis is a god out of the herd, chosen to succeed
the former Apis on the ground that he is far more
handsome and majestic than the run of cattle !</p>

<p>
Actions and beliefs like these on the part of the
public seem to me to require, not someone to censure them, but a Heracleitus or a Democritus, the
one to laugh at their ignorance, the other to bewail
their folly.
1 Nisus, king of Megara, had something in common with
Samson, for as long as the purple tress remained where it
belonged, his city was safe. Ovid (Metam. 8, 1-151) tells
how his daughter robbed him of it, and became Scylla.

Truly, what you are now doing is the reverse ot
what you are aiming to do. You expect to get a
reputation for learning by zealously buying up the
finest books, but the thing goes by opposites and in
a way becomes proof of your ignorance. Indeed,
you do not buy the finest ; you rely upon men who
bestow their praise hit-and-miss, you are a godsend to the people that tell such lies about books,
and a treasure-trove ready to hand to those who
traffic in them. Why, how can you tell what books
are old and highly valuable, and what are worthless
and simply in wretched repair1— unless you judge
them by the extent to which they are eaten into and
cut up, calling the book-worms into counsel to settle
the question ? As to their correctness and freedom
from mistakes, what judgement have you, and what
is it worth ?

Yet suppose I grant you that you have selected the
very éditions de luxe that were prepared by Callinus
or by the famous Atticus with the utmost care.2

2 Both Atticus and Callinus are mentioned again as scribes
in this piece (24) ; Callinus is not elsewhere mentioned, but
Atticus is supposed to be the “publisher” of the Atticiana,
editions which had great repute in antiquity. It is hardly
likely that he is Cicero’s friend.

What good, you strange person, will it do you to own
them, when you do not understand their beauty and
will never make use of it one whit more than a blind
man would enjoy beauty in favourites? To be sure you
look at your books with your eyes open and quite as
much as you like, and you read some of them aloud
with great fluency, keeping your eyes in advance of
your lips; but I do not consider that enough, unless
you know the merits and defects of each passage in
their contents, unless you understand what every
sentence means, how to construe the words, what
expressions have been accurately turned by the
writer in accordance with the canon of good use, and
what are false, illegitimate, and counterfeit.

Come now, do you maintain that without instruction you know as much as we? How can you,
unless, like the shepherd of old,1 you once received a
branch of laurel from the Muses? Helicon, which the
goddesses are said to haunt, you never even heard of,
I take it, and your haunts in your boyhood were not
the same as ours. That you should even mention
the Muses is impious. They would not have shrunk
from showing themselves to a shepherd, a hardbitten, hairy man displaying rich tan on his body,
but as for the like of you—in the name of your lady
of Lebanon2 dispense me for the present from giving
a full description of you in plain language !—they
would never have deigned, I am sure, to come near
you, but instead of giving you laurel they would have
scourged you with myrtle or sprays of mallow and
would have made you keep your distance from those

No matter how shameless you are and how
courageous in such matters, you would never dare to
say that you have had an education, or that you ever
troubled yourself to associate intimately with books,
or that So-and-so was your teacher and you went to
school with So-and-so.

You expect to make up for
all that now by one single expedient—by getting
many books. On that theory, collect and keep all
those manuscripts of Demosthenes that the orator
wrote with his own hand, and those of Thucydides
that were found to have been copied, likewise by
Demosthenes, eight times over, and even all the
books that Sulla sent from Athens to Italy.1 What
would you gain by it in the way of learning, even if
you should put them under your pillow and sleep
on them or should glue them together and walk
about dressed in them? “A monkey is always a
monkey,” says the proverb, “even if he has birthtokens of gold.”2 Although you have a book in
your hand and read all the time, you do not understand a single thing that you read, but you are like
the donkey that listens to the lyre and wags his ears.</p>

If possessing books made their owner learned, they
would indeed be a possession of great price, and only
rich men like you would have them, since you could
buy them at auction, as it were, outbidding us poor

men. In that case, however, who could rival the
dealers and booksellers for learning, who possess and
sell so many books? But if you care to look into
the matter, you will see that they are not much
superior to you in that point; they are barbarous of
speech and obtuse in mind like you—just what one
would expect people to be who have no conception
of what is good and bad. Yet you have only two or
three books which they themselves have sold you,
while they handle books night and day.

What good,
then, does it do you to buy them—unless you think
that even the book-cases are learned because they
contain so many of the works of the ancients !</p>

Answer me this question, if you will—or better,
as you are unable to answer, nod or shake your
head inreply. If a man who did not know how to
play the flute should buy the instrument of Timotheus
or that of Ismenias,1 for which [smenias paid seven
talents in Corinth, would that make him able to play,
or would it do him no good to own it since he did
not know how to use it as a musician would? You
did well to shake your head. Even if he obtained the
flute of Marsyas or Olympus, he could not play without previous instruction. And what if a man should
get the bow of Heracles without being a Philoctetes
so as to be able to draw it and shoot straight ? What
do you think about him? That he would make any
showing worthy of an archer? You shake your head
at this, too. So, of course, with a man who does not
know how to steer, and one who has not practised

assent to this? Take my advice, now, and assent to
this also; if an ignorant man like you should buy
many books, would he not give rise to gibes at himself for his ignorance? Why do you shrink from
assenting to this also? To do so is a clear giveaway, I maintain, and everybody who sees it at once

Not long ago there was a rich man in Asia, both of
whose feet had been amputated in consequence of
an accident; they were frozen, I gather, when he
had to make a journey through snow. Well, this of
course was pitiable, and to remedy the mischance he
had had wooden feet made for him, which he used to
lace on, and in that way made shift to walk, leaning
upon his servants as he did so, But he did one thing
that was ridiculous: he used always to buy very
handsome sandals of the latest cut and went to the
utmost trouble in regard to them, in order that his
timber toes might be adorned with the most beautiful footwear! Now are not you doing just the same
thing? Is it not true that although you have a

the rest of the book, for none of it applies to you ;
but he has a description of a man making a speech,
an utterly ridiculous fellow, warped and deformed
in body.1 Now then, if that man, Thersites, should
get the armour of Achilles, do you suppose that he
would thereby at once become both handsome and
strong ; that he would leap the river, redden its stream
with Trojan gore, and kill Hector—yes, and before
Hector, kill Lycaon and Asteropaeus—when he cannot even carry the “ash tree” 
on his shoulders?2
You will hardly say so. No, he would make himself
a laughing-stock, limping under the shield, falling on
his face beneath the weight of it, showing those
squint eyes of his under the helmet every time he
looked up, making the corselet buckle up with the
hump on his back, trailing the greaves on the ground
—disgracing, in short, both the maker of the arms
and their proper owner. Do not you see that the
same thing happens in your case, when the roll that
you hold in your hands is very beautiful, with a slipcover of purple vellum and a gilt knob, but in
reading it you barbarize its language, spoil its beauty
and warp its meaning? Men of learning laugh at
you, while the toadies who live with you praise you

another and laugh!

I should like to tell you of an incident that took
place at Delphi. A man of Tarentum, Evangelus
by name, a person of some distinction in Tarentum,
desired to obtain a victory in the Pythian games. As
far as the athletic competition was concerned, at the
very outset that seemed to him to be impossible, as
1 Iliad 2,212.
2 Cf, Iliad 19, 387 fi

<pb n="187"/>

he was not well endowed by nature either for
strength or for speed; but in playing the lyre and
singing he became convinced that he would win
easily, thanks to detestable fellows whom he had
about him, who applauded and shouted whenever he
made the slightest sound in striking up. So he came
to Delphi resplendent in every way; in particular,
he had provided himself with a gold-embroidered
robe and a very beautiful laurel-wreath of gold,
which for berries had emeralds as large as berries.
The lyre itself was something extraordinary for
beauty and costliness, all of pure gold, ornamented
with graven gems and many-coloured jewels, with
the Muses and Apollo and Orpheus represented
upon it in relief—a great marvel to all who saw it.1

@

When the day of the competition at last came,
there were three of them, and Evangelus drew
second place on the programme. So, after Thespis _
of Thebes had made a good showing, he came in all
ablaze with gold and emeralds and beryls and sapphires. The purple of his robe also became him
well, gleaming beside the gold. With all this he
bedazzled the audience in advance and filled his
hearers with wonderful expectations; but when at
Jength he had to sing and play whether he would or
no, he struck up a discordant, jarring prelude, breaking three strings at once by coming down upon the
lyre harder than he ought, and began to sing ‘in an
unmusical, thin voice, so that a burst of laughter
came from the whole audience, and the judges of the
competition, indignant at his presumption, scourged
him and turned him out of the theatre. Then indeed
1 Compare the version of this story given in the Rhetorica
ad Herennium 4, 47.

<pb n="189"/>

that precious simpleton1 Evangelus cut a comical
figure with his tears as he was chivvied across the
stage by the scourgers, his legs all bloody from their
whips, gathering up the gems of the lyre—for they
had dropped out when it shared his flogging.

@

After a moment’s delay, a man named Eumelus,
from Elis, came on, who had an old lyre, fitted with
wooden pegs, and a costume that, including the
wreath, was hardly worth ten drachmas; but as he
sang well and played skilfully, he had the best of it
and was proclaimed victor, so that he could laugh at
Evangelus for the empty display that he had made
with his lyre and his gems. Indeed, the story goes
that he said to him: “Evangelus, you wear golden
laurel, being rich; but I am poor and I wear the
laurel of Delphi! ‘However, you got at least this
much by your outfit: you are going away not only
unpitied for your defeat but hated into the bargain
because of this inartistic lavishness of yours.” There
you have your own living image in Evangelus, except
that you are not at all put out by the laughter of
the audience. 1
@

It would not be out of place to tell you another
story about something that happened in Lesbos
long ago. They say that when the women of Thrace
tore Orpheus to pieces, his head and his lyre fell
into the Hebrus, and were carried out into the
Aegean Sea; and that the head floated along on the
lyre, singing a dirge (so the story goes) over Orpheus,
1 The word χρυσοῦς, applied to a person, means “simpleton” (Lapsus 1). Here, of course, it also has a punning turn.

<pb n="191"/>

while the lyre itself gave out sweet sounds as the
winds struck the strings. In that manner they came
ashore at Lesbos to the sound of music, and the
people there took them up, burying the head where
their temple of Dionysus now stands and hanging
up the lyre in the temple of Apollo, where it was
long preserved. 

@

In after time, however, Neanthus,
the son of Pittacus the tyrant, heard how the lyre
charmed animals and plants and stones, and made
music even after the death of Orpheus without anyone’s touching it; so he fell in love with the thing,
‘tampered with the priest, and by means of a generous
bribe prevailed upon him to substitute another similar
lyre, and give him the one of Orpheus. After
securing it, he did not think it safe to play it in the
city by day, but went out into the suburbs at night
with it under his cloak, and then, taking it in hand,
struck and jangled the strings, untrained and unmusical
lad that he was, expecting that under his touch the
lyre would make wonderful music with which he
could charm and enchant everybody, and indeed that
he would become immortal, inheriting the musical
genius of Orpheus. At length the dogs (there were
many of them there), brought together by the noise,
tore him to pieces; so his fate, at least, was like
that of Orpheus, and only the dogs answered his
call. By that it became very apparent that it was
not the lyre which had wrought the spell, but the
skill and the singing of Orpheus, the only distinctive
gifts that he had from his mother; while the lyre
was just a piece of property, no better than any
other stringed instrument.

<pb n="193"/>
@
But why do I talk to you of Orpheus and Neanthus, when even in our own time there was and still
is, I think, a man who paid three thousand drachmas
for the earthenware lamp of Epictetus the Stoic:
He thought, I suppose, that if he should read by —
that lamp at night, he would forthwith acquire the
wisdom of Epictetus in his dreams and would be just
like that marvellous old man. 

@
And only a day or
two ago another man paid a talent for the staff which
Proteus the Cynic laid aside before leaping into the
fire ;1 and he keeps this treasure and displays it just
as the Tegeans do the skin of the Calydonian boar,
the Thebans the bones of Geryon, and the Memphites the tresses of Isis. Yet the original owner
of this marvellous possession surpassed even you
yourself in ignorance and indecency. You see what
a wretched state the collector is in: in all conscience
he needs a staff—on his pate.

They say that Dionysius2 used to write tragedy in
a very feeble and ridiculous style, so that Philoxenus3
was often thrown into the quarries on account of it,
not being able to control his laughter. Well, when
he discovered that he was being laughed at, he took
great pains to procure the wax-tablets on which
Aeschylus used to write, thinking that he too would
be inspired and possessed with divine frenzy in virtue
of the tablets. But for all that, what he wrote on
those very tablets was far more ridiculous than what
he had written before : for example,

oil of cedar, putting slip-covers on them, and fitting

some profit from them? Ah yes, already you have

or historian or poet it was by, and you, knowing from
the title, should easily answer that question; and if
then—for such topics often spin themselves out to
some length in conversation—he should either commend or criticise something in its contents, and you
should be at a loss and have nothing to say? Would
you not then pray for the earth to open and swallow
you for getting yourself into trouble like Bellerophon
by carrying your book about?1

When Demetrius, the Cynic, while in Corinth, saw
an ignorant fellow reading a beautiful book (it was
the Bacchae of Euripides, I dare say, and he was at
the place where the messenger reports the fate of
Pentheus and the deed of Agave),2 he snatched it
away and tore it up, saying: “It is better for
Pentheus to be torn to tatters by me once for all
than by you repeatedly.”</p>

Though I am continually asking myself the
question, I have never yet been able to discover why
you have shown so much zeal in the purchase of
books. Nobody who knows you in the least would
think that you do it on account of their helpfulness
or use, any more than a bald man would buy a comb,
or a blind man a mirror, or a deaf-mute a flute-player,
or an eunuch a concubine, or a landsman an oar, or a
seaman a plough. But perhaps you regard the matter
as a display of wealth and wish to show everyone
that out of your vast surplus you spepd money even
for things of no use to you? Come now, as far as I
know—and I too am a Syrian3—if you had not

smuggled yourself into that old man’s will with all
speed, you would be starving to death by now, and
would be putting up your books at auction! 

@

The
only remaining reason is that you have been convinced by your toadies that you are not only handsome and charming but a scholar and an orator and
a writer without peer, and you buy the books to
prove their praises true. They say that you hold
forth to them at dinner, and that they, like stranded
frogs, make a clamour because they are thirsty, or
else they get nothing to drink if they do not burst
themselves shouting.</p>

<p>
To be sure, you are somehow very easy to lead by
the nose, and believe them in everything ; for once
you were even persuaded that you resembled a
certain royal person in looks, like the false Alexander, the false Philip (the fuller), the false Nero in
our grandfathers’ time, and whoever else has been
put down under the title “false.”1 

@

And what
wonder that you, a silly, ignorant fellow, were thus
imposed upon and appeared in public holding your
head high and imitating the gait and dress and
glance of the man whom you delighted to make
yourself resemble ? Even Pyrrhus of Epirus, a marvellous man in other ways, was once, they say, so
spoiled by toadies after the self-same fashion that he
believed he was like the famous Alexander. Yet (to
borrow a phrase from the musicians) the discrepancy
1 Balas, in the second century B.c., claimed to be the
brother of Antiochus V. Eupator on account of a strong
resemblance in looks, and took the name of Alexander. At
about the same time, after the defeat of Perses, Andriscus of
Adramyttium, a fuller, claimed the name of Philip. The
false Nero cropped up some twenty years after Nero’s death,
and probably in the East, as he had strong support from
the Parthians, who refused to surrender him to Rome.

was a matter of two octaves; for I have seen the
portrait of Pyrrhus. But in spite of that he had
acquired the conviction that he was a perfect replica
of Alexander’s beauty. To be sure, I have been uncomplimentary to Pyrrhus in comparing you with him
in this matter, but what followed would be quite in
character with you. When Pyrrhus was in this state
of mind and had this conviction about himself, everyone without exception concurred with him and
humoured him until an old foreign woman in Larissa
told him the truth and cured him of drivelling.
Pyrrhus showed her portraits of Philip, Perdiccas,
Alexander, Cassander and other kings, and asked her
whom he resembled, quite certain that she would fix
upon Alexander ; but, after delaying a good while,
she said, “Batrachion, the cook’: and as a matter
of fact there was in Larissa a cook called Batrachion
who resembled Pyrrhus.

@

As for you, I cannot say which of the profligates
that hang about the actors in the pantomimes you
resemble; I do know very well, however, that
everyone thinks you are still downright daft over
that likeness. It is no wonder, then, since you are
such a failure at likenesses, that you want to make
yourself resemble men of learning, believing those
who praise you so.</p>

<p>
But why do I talk beside the point? The reason
for your craze about books is patent, even if I in my
blindness failed to see it long ago. It is a bright
idea on your part (you think so, anyhow), and.you
base no slight expectations upon the thing in case
the emperor, who is a scholar and holds learning
in especial esteem, should find out about it; if he
should hear that you are buying books and making

<pb n="203"/>

a large collection, you think you will soon get all you
want from him. 

@

But do you suppose, you rotter,
that he is so steeped in mandragora as to hear that
and yet not know how you pass your time during the
day, what your drinking bouts are like, how you
spend your nights, and in whose company? Do not
you know that a monarch has many eyes and ears?
And your doings are so conspicuous that even the
blind and the deaf may know of them; for if you
but speak, if you but bathe in public—or, if you
choose, don’t even do that—if your servants but
bathe in public, do you not think that all your
nocturnal arcana will be known at once? Answer
me this question: if Bassus, that literary man who
belonged to your following, or Battalus the fluteplayer, or the cinaedus Hemitheon of Sybaris,
who wrote those wonderful regulations for you,
which say that you must use cosmetics and depilatories and so forth—if one of those fellows should
to-day walk about with a lion’s skin on his back and
a club in his hand, what do you suppose those who
saw him would think? That he was Heracles? Not
unless they were gravel-blind; for there are a
thousand things in their appearance that would give
the lie to their costume; the gait, the glance, the
voice, the thin neck, the white lead and mastich and
rouge that you beautify yourselves with ; in short, to
quote the proverb, it would be easier to conceal five
elephants under your arm than a single cinaedus.
Then if the lion’s skin would not have hidden such
as they, do you suppose that you will be undetected

your sort will betray and reveal you.
@

You are completely unaware, it seems to me, that
good expectations are not to be sought from the
booksellers but derived from one’s self and one’s
daily life. Do you expect to find public advocates
and character-witnesses in the scribes Atticus and
Callinus? No: you will find them heartless fellows,
bent upon ruining you, if the gods so will it, and
reducing you to the uttermost depths of poverty.
Even now you ought to come to your senses, sell
these books to some learned man, and your new
house along with them, and then pay the slave
dealers at least a part of the large sums you owe
them.
@
For mark this, you have had a tremendous passion
for two things, the acquisition of expensive books
and the purchase of well-grown, vigorous slaves, and
you are showing great zeal and persistence in the
thing; but being poor, you cannot adequately
manage both. See now what a precious thing
advice is! I urge you to drop what does not
concern you, cultivate your other weakness, and
buy those menials of yours, so that your household
may not be depleted and you may not for that
reason have to send out for free men, who, if they
do not get all they want, can safely go away and
tell what you do after your wine. For instance, only
the other day a vile fellow told a most disgraceful
story about you when he came away, and even
showed marks. I can prove by those who were there
at the time that I was indignant and came near
giving him a thrashing in my anger on your behalf,

corroborate his evidence and they all told the same

yourself at home in great security; for who could
persuade you now to change your ways? When a
dog has once learned to gnaw leather, he cannot
stop.1 

@

The other way is easier, not to buy books any
longer. You are well enough educated ; you have
learning to spare ; you have all the works of antiquity
almost at the tip of your tongue; you know not only
all history but all the arts of literary composition, its
merits and defects, and how to use an Attic vocabulary ; your many books have made you wondrous
wise, consummate in learning. There is no reason
why I should not have my fun with you, since you
like to be gulled!

@

As you have so many books, I should like to ask
you what you like best to read ? Plato? Antisthenes?
Archilochus ? Hipponax? Or do you scorn them and
incline to occupy yourself with the orators? Tell
me, do you read the speech of Aeschines against
Timarchus? No doubt you know it all and understand everything in it, but have you dipped into
Aristophanes and Eupolis? Have you read the
Baptae, the whole play?2 Then did it have no
effect upon you, and did you not blush when you saw
the point of it? Indeed, a man may well wonder
above all what the state of your soul is when you

open them. When do you do your reading? In the
daytime ? Nobody ever saw you doing it. - At night,
then? When you have already given instructions
to your henchmen, or before you have talked with
them? Come, in the name of Cotys, never again
dare to do such a thing.

Leave the books alone
and attend to your own affairs exclusively. Yet you
ought not to do that, either; you ought to be put
to shame by Phaedra in Euripides, who is indignant
at women and says:

But if you have made up your mind to cleave to
the same infirmity at all costs, go ahead: buy books,
keep them at home under lock and key, and enjoy
the fame of your treasures—that is enough for you.
But never lay hands on them or read them or sully
with your tongue the prose and poetry of the
ancients, that has done you no harm.</p>

<p>

I know that in all this I am wasting words, and, as
the proverb has it, trying to scrub an Ethiop white.
You will buy them and make no use of them and
get yourself laughed at by men of learning who are
satisfied with the gain that they derive, not from the
beauty of books or their expensiveness, but from the
language and thought of their author. 

@

You expect
to palliate and conceal your ignorance by getting
a reputation for this, and to daze people by the
number of your books, unaware that you are doing
the same as the most ignorant physicians, who get
themselves ivory pill-boxes and silver cupping-glasses
and gold-inlaid scalpels ; when the time comes to use

something still more comical. Consider the barbers
and you will observe that the master-craftsmen
among them have only a razor and a pair of shears
and a suitable mirror, while the unskilled, amateurish
fellows put on view a multitude of shears and huge
mirrors ; but for all that, they cannot keep their
ignorance from being found out. In fact, what
happens to them is as comical as can be—people
have their hair cut next door and then go to
their mirrors to brush it.

So it is with you: you
might, to be sure, lend your books to someone else
who wants them, but you cannot use them yourself.
But you never lent a book to anyone; you act like
the dog in the manger, who neither eats the grain
herself nor lets the horse eat it, who can.</p>

<head>THE DREAM OR LUCIAN’S CAREER<note><p>The Dream contains no hint that a lecture is to follow it,
but its brevity, its structure—a parable followed by its
application—and the intimacy of its tone show that it is an
introduction similar to Dionysus and Amber. Read certainly
in Syria, and almost certainly in Lucian’s native city of
Samosata, it would seem to have been composed on his first
return to Syria, after the visit to Gaul that made him rich
and famous ; probably not long after it, for his return home
is quite likely to have come soon after his departure from
Gaul. It reads, too, as if it were written in the first flush
of success, before his fortieth year.</p>
<p>Since it gives us a glimpse of his early history, and professes to tell us how he chose his career, it makes a good
introduction to his works. For that reason it was put first
in the early editions, and has found a place in a great many
school readers, so that none of his writings is better known.
The amount of autobiography in it is not great. Lucian
names no names, which might have given us valuable information as to his race, and he says nothing about his father
except that he was not well off in the world. That his
mother’s father and brothers were sculptors, that he evinced
his inheritance of the gift by his cleverness in modelling, and
that he was therefore apprenticed to his uncle to learn the
trade—all this is inherently probable, and  interesting
because it accounts for the seeing eye that made his penpictures so realistic. As to the dream, and his deliberate
choice of a literary career on account of it, that is surely
fiction. From what he does not say here, from what Oratory
lets drop in the Double Indtctment—that she found him
wandering up and down Ionia, all but wearing native garb—
we may guess that distaste for the sculptor’s rade led
him to run away from home without any very definite
notion where he was going or what he should do, and that
the dream, plainly inspired less by a thrashing than by the
famous allegory of the sophist Prodicus, Heracles at the
Crossways (Xenophon, Memorabilia 2, 1, 21), came to him in
later years, while he meditated what he should say to those
at home upon his return to them.</p></note></head>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="1"><p>
No sooner had I left off school, being then well
on in my teens, than my father and his friends
began to discuss what he should have me taught
next. Most of them thought that higher education
required great labour, much time, considerable
expense, and conspicuous social position, while our
circumstances were but moderate and demanded .
speedy relief; but that if I were to learn one of
the handicrafts, in the first place I myself would
immediately receive my support from the trade
instead of continuing to share the family table at
my age; besides, at no distant day I would delight
my father by bringing home my earnings regularly.

@

The next topic for discussion was opened by
raising the question, which of the trades was best,
easiest to learn, suitable for a man of free birth,
required an outfit that was easy to come by, and
offered an income that was sufficient. Each praised
a different trade, according to his own judgement or
experience ; but my father looked at my uncle (for
among the company was my uncle on my mother’s
side, who had the reputation of being an excellent.
sculptor) and said: “It isn’t right that any other

<pb n="217"/>

trade should have the preference while you are by.
Come, take this lad in hand’—with a gesture
toward me—“and teach him to be a good stone-cutter, mason, and sculptor, for he is capable of it,
since, as you know, he has a natural gift for it.”’
He drew this inference from the way in which I
had played with wax; for whenever my teachers
dismissed me I would scrape the wax from my
tablets and model cattle or horses or even men, and’
they were true to life, my father thought. I used
to get thrashings from my teachers on account of
them, but at that time they brought me praise for
my cleverness, and good hopes were entertained of
me, on the ground that I would soon learn the trade,
to judge from that modelling.
@

So, as soon as it seemed to be a suitable day to
begin a trade, I was turned over to my uncle, and I
was not greatly displeased with the arrangement, I
assure you; on the contrary, I thought it involved
interesting play of a sort, and a chance to show off
to my schoolmates if I should turn out to be carving
gods and fashioning little figures for myself and for
those I liked best. Then came the first step and
the usual experience of beginners. My uncle gave
me a chisel and told me to strike a light blow on a
slab that lay at hand, adding the trite quotation:
“Well begun, half done.” But in my inexperience
I struck too hard; the slab broke, and in a gust of
anger he seized a stick that lay close by and put me
through an initiation of no gentle or encouraging
sort, so that tears were the overture to my apprenticeship.
@
I ran away from the place and came home sobbing
continuously, with my eyes abrim with tears. I told

<pb n="219"/>

about the stick, showed the welts and charged my
uncle with great cruelty, adding that he did it out of
jealousy, for fear that I should get ahead of him in
his trade. My mother comforted me and roundly
abused her brother, but when night came on, I fell
asleep, still tearful and thinking of the stick.
@
Up to this point my story has been humorous and
childish, but what you shall hear next, gentlemen,
is not to be made light of; it deserves a very
receptive audience. The fact is that, to use the
words of Homer,

<cit>
<quote>
    <l>a god-sent vision appeared unto me in my slumber
Out of immortal night,</l>
</quote>
<bibl>Iliad 2, 56.</bibl>
</cit>


so vivid as not to fall short of reality in any way.
Indeed, even after all this time, the figures that I
saw continue to abide in my eyes and the words that
I heard in my ears, so plain was it all.
@
Two women, taking me by the hands, were each
trying to drag me toward herself with might and
main ; in fact, they nearly pulled me to pieces in
their rivalry. Now one of them would get the
better of it and almost have me altogether, and now
I would be in the hands of the other. They
shouted at each other, too, one of them saying,
‘He is mine, and you want to get him!” and the
other: “It is no good your claiming what belongs
to someone else.” One was like a workman, masculine, with unkempt hair, hands full of callous
places, clothing tucked up, and a heavy layer of

<pb n="221"/>

warble-dust upon her, just as my uncle looked when
he cut stone. The other, however, was very fair of
face, dignified in her appearance, and nice in her
dress.</p>

<p>
At length they allowed me to decide which of
them I wanted to be with. The first to state her
case was the hard-favoured, masculine one.
@
“Dear boy, I am the trade of Sculpture which
you began to learn yesterday, of kin to you and
related by descent ; for your grandfather”—and she
gave the name of my mother’s father—“was a
sculptor, and so are both your uncles, who are very
famous through me. If you are willing to keep
clear of this woman’s silly nonsense” —with a gesture
toward the other—“and to come and live with me,
you will be generously kept and will have powerful
shoulders, and you will be a stranger to jealousy of
any sort; besides you will never go abroad, leaving
your native country and your kinsfolk, and it will
not be for mere words, either, that everyone will
praise you.

@
“Do not be disgusted at my humble figure and
my soiled clothing, for this is the way in which
Phidias began, who revealed Zeus, and Polycleitus,
who made Hera, Myron, whom men praise, and
Praxiteles, at whom they marvel. Indeed, these men
receive homage second only to the gods. If you
become one of them, will you not yourself be
famous in the sight of all mankind, make your

<pb n="223"/>

father envied, and cause your native land to be
admired ?”</p>

<p>
Sculpture said all this, and even more than this,
with a great deal of stumbling and bad grammar,
talking very hurriedly and trying to convince me:
I do not remember it all, however, for most of it has
escaped my memory by this time.</p>

<p>
When she stopped, the other began after this
fashion :
@

“My child, I am Education, with whom you are
already acquainted and familiar, even if you have
not yet completed your experience of me. What
it shall profit you to become a sculptor, this
woman has told you; you will be nothing but
a labourer, toiling with your body and putting in it
your entire hope of a livelihood, personally inconspicuous, getting meagre and_ illiberal returns,
humble-witted, an insignificant figure in public,
neither sought by your friends nor feared by your
enemies nor envied by your fellow-citizens—nothing
but just a labourer, one of the swarming rabble, ever
cringing to the man above you and courting the man
who can use his tongue, leading a hare’s life, and
counting as a godsend to anyone stronger. Even
if you should become a Phidias or a Polycleitus and
should create many marvellous works, everyone
would praise your craftsmanship, to be sure, but
none of those who saw you, if he were sensible,
would pray to be like you; for no matter what you
might be, you would be considered a mechanic, a
man who has naught but his hands, a man who lives
by his hands.
@

“If you follow my advice, first of all I shall show
you many works of men of old, tell you their

wondrous deeds and words, and make you conversant
with almost all knowledge, and I shall ornament your
soul, which concerns you most, with many noble
adornments—temperance, justice, piety, kindliness,
reasonableness, understanding, steadfastness, love of
all that is beautiful, ardour towards all that is sublime ;
for these are the truly flawless jewels of the soul.
Nothing that came to pass of old will escape you;

and admired by men_ preeminent in lineage and in

pointed to her own, and she was very splendidly
dressed—“and will be deemed worthy of office and

some men become immortal. I shall bring this to pass


<pb n="227"/>

with you; for though you yourself depart from life, you
will never cease associating with men of education and
conversing with men of eminence. You know whose
son Demosthenes was, and how great I made him.
You know that Aeschines was the son of a tambourine girl, but for all that, Philip paid court to him
for my sake. And Socrates himself was brought upunder the tutelage of our friend Sculpture, but as
soon as he understood what was better he ran away
from her and joined my colours ; and you have heard
how his praises are sung by everyone.
@
“On the other hand, if you turn your back upon
these men so great and noble, upon glorious deeds
and sublime words, upon a dignified appearance,
upon honour, esteem, praise, precedence, power and
offices, upon fame for eloquence and felicitations for
wit, then you will put on a filthy tunic, assume a
servile appearance, and hold bars and gravers and
sledges and chisels in your hands, with your back bent
over your work; you will be a groundling, with groundling ambitions, altogether humble ; you will never lift
your head, or conceive a single manly or liberal
thought, and although you will plan to make your
works well-balanced and well-shapen, you will not
show any concern to make yourself well-balanced and
sightly ; on the contrary, you will make yourself a
thing of less value than a block of stone.”

@

While these words were still on her lips, without
waiting for her to finish what she was saying, I stood
up and declared myself. Abandoning the ugly


<pb n="229"/>

working-woman, I went over to Education with a
right good will, especially when the stick entered
my mind and the fact that it had laid many a blow
upon me at the very outset the day before. When
I abandoned Sculpture, at first she was indignant
and struck her hands together and ground her
teeth ; but at length, like Niobe in the story, she
grew rigid and turned to stone. Her fate was
strange, but do not be incredulous, for dreams work
miracles.

@
The other fixed her eyes upon me and said: “I
will therefore repay you for the justice that you have
done in judging this issue rightly : come at once and
mount this car”—pointing to a car with winged
horses resembling Pegasus—“in order that you may
know what you would have missed if you had not
come with me.” When I had mounted she plied whip
and reins, and I was carried up into the heights and
went from the East to the very West, surveying
cities and nations and peoples, sowing something
broadcast over the earth like Triptolemus. I do not
now remember what it was that I sowed; only that
men, looking up from below, applauded, and all those
above whom I passed in my flight sped me on my way
with words of praise.
@
After all this had been shown to me and I to the
men who applauded, she brought me back again, no
longer dressed in the same clothing that I wore when
I began the flight ; I dreamed that I came back in
princely purple. Finding my father standing and
waiting, she pointed him out my clothing and the

<pb n="231"/>

guise in which I had returned, and even reminded
him gently of the plans that they had narrowly
escaped making for me.</p>

<p>
That is the dream which I remember having had
when I wasa slip of a lad; it was due, I suppose, to
my agitation on account of the fear inspired by the
thrashing.

@
Even as I speaking, “Heracles!!” someone
said, “what a long and tiresome dream!” Then
someone else broke in: “A winter dream, when the
nights are longest ; or perhaps it is itself a product
of three nights, like Heracles!1 What got into him
to tell us this idle tale and to speak of a night of his
childhood and dreams that are ancient and superannuated ?_ It is flat to spin pointless yarns. Surely
he doesn't take us for interpreters of dreams?” No,
my friend; and Xenophon, too, when he told one
time. how he dreamed that a bolt of lightning,
striking his father’s house, set it afire, and all the
rest of it—you know it—did not do so because he
wanted the dream interpreted, nor yet because he
had made up his mind to talk nonsense, particularly
in time of war and in a desperate state of affairs,
with the enemy on every side; no, the story had a
certain usefulness.2
@18

So it was with me, and I told you this dream in
order that those who are young may take the better
direction and cleave to education, above all if poverty

nights,” because Zeus tripled the length of the night which
he spent with Alcmene. See Dual. of the Gods 14 (vulg. 10).

a later dream (4, 3, 7), evidently thinks that it was told to
the soldiers to hearten them, but this is not the case. Xenophon was unable to interpret it until after the event, and did

is making any one of them faint-hearted and inclining him toward the worse, to the detriment of a
noble nature. He will be strengthened, I am very
sure, by hearing the tale, if he takes me as an
adequate example, reflecting what I was when
aspired to all that is finest and set my heart on
education, showing no weakness in the face of my
poverty at that time, and what I am now, on my
return to you—if nothing more, at least quite as
highly thought of as any sculptor.

<head>THE PARASITE TYCHIADES<note><p>Ludwig Radermacher has shown that The Parasite owes
its being to the age-long war of words between philosophy
and rhetoric, and should be read in the hght of controversial tracts such as the Rhetoric of Philodemus. Ever
since the time of Plato and Isocrates, the two systems
of education had been fighting for pupils, and philosophy
had found it well worth her while to test the pretensions of
her rival by investigating the nature and value of rhetoric.
As usual, her schools did not agree in their results. The
Stoics found rhetoric fruitful in her promise if cultivated
under proper management; but most of the other schools
would have naught of her. The leading voice of the opposition was that of Critolaus, the Peripatetic, who, debating
against Diogenes the Stoic, tested rhetoric by the Stoic definition of an "art,” and demonstrated to his own satisfaction
that it was none.</p>
<p>The author of the Parasite makes fun of the question, still
very much alive in his time, and of both parties to it by
arguing that Parasitic is an art by the terms of the Stoic
definition, and a better one than either rhetoric or philosophy.
No other pursuit could have served his turn better than that
of the parasite, who made a business of sponging, who, along
with the cook, had been a standing butt of the New Comedy,
and now had become the rival of the philosopher and the
rhetorician for the favour of rich patrons.</p>
<p>The author of this clever comparison had the same standpoint as Lucian with reference to philosophy and rhetoric :
he knows Lucian’s writings ; and the name of Tychiades is
one of Lucian’s masks. He is either Lucian himself or a conscious imitator. But the vocabulary, syntax, and style are
so dissimilar as to seem another’s, and even the humour has
a different quality, for instance; “Aristotle only made a
beginning in Parasitic, as in every other art!” Possibly
Lucian wrote the piece in his extreme old age ; but to my
mind it is more likely to be the work of someone else. It
is certainly prior to the Ungrammatical Man, which satirizes
many words and expressions that occur in it. The text
has come down to us through a single channel, and is exceptionally corrupt.</p></note></head>

TYCHIADES
Why in the world is it, Simon, that while other
men, both slave and free, each know some art by
which they are of use to themselves and to someone
else, you apparently have no work which would
enable you to make any profit yourself or give away
anything to anybody else?
SIMON
What do you mean by that question, Tychiades ?
I do not understand. Try to put it more clearly.
TYCHIADES
Is there any art that you happen to know?
Music, for instance? °
SIMON
No, indeed.
TYCHIADES
Well, medicine ?
SIMON
Not that, either.
TYCHIADES
Geometry, then?
SIMON
Not by any means.

<pb n="239"/>


Well, rhetoric? For as to philosophy, you are as
remote from that as vice itself is!
SIMON
Indeed, even more so, if possible. So don’t suppose you have touched me with that taunt, as if I did
not know it. I admit that I am vicious, and worse
than you think!
TYCHIADES
Quite so. Well, it may be that although you have
not learned those arts because of their magnitude and
difficulty, you have learned one of the vulgar arts
like carpentry or shoemaking; you are not so well
off in every way as not to need even such an art.
SIMON
You are right, Tychiades ; but I am not acquainted
with any of these either.
TYCHIADES
What other art, then?
SIMON
What other? A fine one, I think. If you knew
about it, I believe you would speak highly of it too.
In practice, I claim to be successful at it already,
but whether you will find me so in theory also I
can't say.
TYCHIADES
What is it?
SIMON
I do not feel that I have yet thoroughly mastered
the literature on that subject. So for the present

<pb n="241"/>

you may know that I possess an art and need not be
dissatisfied with me on that score ; some other day
you shall hear what art it is.
TYCHIADES
But I can’t wait.
SIMON
The nature of the art will perhaps seem extraordinary when you hear it.
TYCHIADES
Tr aly, that is just why I am keen to know about it.
SIMON
‘Some other day, Tychiades.
TYCHIADES
Oh, no! Tell me now—unless you are ashamed !
SIMON
Parasitic.
@
TYCHIADES
Really, would anyone who was not insane call that
an art, Simon?
SIMON
I do; and if you think I am insane, think also
that my insanity is the reason for my not knowing any other art and acquit me of your charges at
once. They say, you know, that this malign spirit,
cruel in all else to those whom she inhabits, at least
secures them remission of their sins, like a schoolmaster or a tutor, by taking the blame for them upon
herself. ~
TYCHIADES
Well then, Simon, Parasitic is an art ?

<pb n="243"/>

SIMON
Indeed it is, and I am a craftsman in it.1
TYCHIADES
Then you are a parasite ?
SIMON
That was a cruel thrust, Tychiades !
TYCHIADES
But do not you blush to call yourself a parasite ?
SIMON
Not at all; I should be ashamed not to speak it out.
TYCHIADES
Then, by Zeus, when we wish to tell about you to
someone who does not know you, when he wants to
find out about you, of course we shall be correct in
referring to you as “the parasite”?
SIMON
Far more correct in referring to me so than in
referring to Phidias as a sculptor, for I take quite as
much joy in my art as Phidias did in his Zeus.
TYCHIADES
I say, here is a point; as I think of it, a gale of
laughter has come over me!
SIMON
What is it?
TYCHIADES
What if we should address you in due form at the
top of our letters as “Simon the Parasite”!
1 In the word δημιουργός there is an allusion to the definition of Rhetoric as Πειθοῦς δημιουργός.


<pb n="245"/>


SIMON
Why, you would do me greater pleasure than
you would Dion by addressing him as “the Philosopher.”1

@
TYCHIADES
Well, how it pleases you to be styled matters little
or nothing to me; but you must consider the general
absurdity of it.
SIMON
What absurdity, I should like to know?
TYCHIADES
If we are to list this among the other arts, so that
when anybody enquires what art it is, we shall say
“Parasitic,” to correspond with Music and Rhetoric.2
SIMON
For my part, Tychiades, I should call this an art
far more than any other. If you care to listen, I
think I can tell you why, although, as I just said, I
am not entirely prepared for it.
TYCHIADES It will make no difference at all if you say little,
as long as that little is true.
SIMON
Come now, first of all, if it please you, let us consider what an art is in general; for in that way we
can go on to the individual] arts and see if they truly
come under that head.
1 Dion of Syracuse, the friend of Plato.
2 The examples in the Greek are “Grammar and Medicine,”
but it was necessary to choose English examples which
retained the Greek ending.

<pb n="247"/>

TYCHIADES
What on earth is an art, then? Surely you know.
SIMON
To be sure.
TYCHIADES
Then do not hesitate to tell, if you do know.
@
SIMON
An art, I remember to have heard a learned man
say,1 is a complex of knowledges exercised in combination to some end useful to the world.
TYCHIADES
He was quite right in what he said, and you in
your recollection of it.
SIMON
If Parasitic satisfies this definition completely, what
other conclusion could there be than that it is an art?
TYCHIADES
It would be an art, of course, if it should really be
like that.
SIMON
Now then, let us apply to Parasitic the individual
characteristics of an art and see whether it is in
harmony with them or whether its theory, like a
good-for-nothing pot when you try its ring, sounds
cracked.2 Every art, then, must be a complex of
1 The particular learned man who said it first is not known
to us. It is the orthodox Stoic definition, quoted repeatedly
by Sextus Empiricus. Cf. Quint. 2,17, 41: ille ab omnibus
fere probatus finis ... artem constare ex perceptionibus consentientibus et coexercitatis ad finem utilem vitae.
2 Just so Critolaus had tested rhetoric and found it wanting : see Philodemus, Rhetoric 2; Sextus, Agatnet the Rhetortcrans; and Quintilian 2, 17.

<pb n="249"/>

knowledges ; and of these, in the case of the para
site, first of all there is testing and deciding who
would be suitable to support him, and whom he could
begin to cultivate without being sorry for it later.
Or do we care to maintain that assayers possess an
art because they know how to distinguish between
coins that are counterfeit and those that are not, but
parasites discriminate without art between men that
are counterfeit and those that are good, even though
men are not distinguishable at once, like coins?
Wise Euripides criticizes this very point when he
Says:

<cit>
<quote>
    <l>In men, no mark whereby to tell the knave</l>
<l>Did ever yet upon his body grow.</l>
</quote>
<bibl>Euripides, Medea 518.</bibl>
</cit>

This makes the parasite’s art even greater, since it is
better than divination at distinguishing and recognising things so obscure and hidden.
@
As for knowing how to talk appropriately and to
act in such a way as to become intimate and show
himself extremely devoted to his patron, do not
you think that this shows intelligence and highlydeveloped knowledge?
TYCHIADES
Yes, indeed.
SIMON
And at banquets, to go away with more than anybody else, enjoying greater favour than those who do
not possess the same art—-do you think that can
be managed without some degree of theory and
wisdom ?

<pb n="251"/>

TYCHIADES
Not by any means.
SIMON
What about knowing the merits and defects of
bake-stuffs and made dishes? Does that seem to you
matter for an untrained man’s bumptious inquisitiveness? Yet excellent Plato says: 

<cit>
<quote>
   When a man is
about to partake of a banquet, if he be not versed
in the art of cookery, his opinion of the feast in
preparation is something deficient in weight.
</quote>
<bibl>Plato, Theaetetus 178D.</bibl>
</cit>


@

That Parasitic is based not only on knowledge,
but on exercised knowledge, you may readily assure
yourself from this fact: the knowledges that belong
to the other arts often remain unexercised for days
and nights and months and years, and yet the arts
are not lost to those who possess them ; but if the .
parasite’s knowledge is not in exercise daily, not
only the art, I take it, but the artist himself, is lost
thereby !
@

And as to its being “directed to some end. useful
to the world,” it would be crazy, don’t you think,
to investigate that point. I, for my part, cannot
discover that anything in the world is more useful
than eating and drinking, and in fact without them
it is impossible to live at all !
TYCHIADES
Quite so.

@

SIMON
Again, Parasitic is not the same sort of thing as
beauty and strength, so as to be considered a gift,.
like them, rather than an art.1

1 Again a thrust at Rhetoric, which some considered “vis
tantum” ; cf. Quintilian 2, 15, 2.

<pb n="253"/>

TYCHIADES
You are right.
SIMON
But on the other hand, it is not want of art; for
want of art never achieves anything for its possessor.1
For example, if you should put yourself in command
of a ship at sea in a storm without knowing how to
steer, should you come safely through ?
TYCHIADES
Not by any means.
SIMON
How about a man who should take horses in hand
without knowing how to drive?
TYCHIADES
He would not come through, either.
SIMON
Why, pray, except because he does not possess the
art by which he would be able to save himself?
TYCHIADES
To be sure.
SIMON
Then the parasite would not be saved by Parasitic
if it were want of art?
TY CHIADES
True.
SIMON
Then it is art that saves him, and not want of art ?
TYCHIADES
Quite so.
1 Rhetoric is a want of art: cf. § 27, and Quint. 2, 15, 2.

<pb n="255"/>

SIMON
Then Parasitic is an art ?
TYCHIADES
It is, apparently.
SIMON
I assure you I know of many instances when good
helmsmen have been wrecked and expert drivers
thrown from their seats, and some had _ broken
bones, while others were completely done for; but
nobody can cite any such mishap in the case of a
parasite.
Then if Parasitic is not want of art and not a
gift, but a complex of knowledges exercised in combination, evidently we have reached an agreement
to-day that it is an art.
@
TYCHIADES
As far as I can judge from what has been said.
But wait a bit: give us a first-class definition of
Parasitic.
SIMON
Right. It seems to me that the definition might
best be expressed’ thus: Parasitic is that art which
is concerned with food and drink and what must be
said and done to obtain them, and its end is pleasure.
TYCHIADES
That, to my mind, is a tip-top definition of your
art; but look out that you do not get into conflict
with some of the philosophers over the end.1
1 With the Epicureans, who claimed the same summum
bonum, and the Stoics, who rejected it. The Stoics are met
tirst, with the argument that not virtue but Parasitic is the
consummation of happiness. The sense of réAos shifts
slightly, to prepare for its use in the citation from Homer.

<pb n="257"/>

SIMON
It will be quite sufficient if I can show that happiness and Parasitic have the same end, and that
will be plain from this: 
@

wise Homer, admiring the
life of a parasite on the ground that it alone is blessed
and enviable, says:
<cit>
<quote>
<l>I for my own part hold that there is no end more delightful</l>
<l>Than when cheerfulness reigneth supreme over all of the people ;</l>
<l>Banqueters down the long halls give ear to the bard as he singeth,</l>
<l>Sitting in regular order, and by each man is a table</l>
<l>Laden with bread and with meat; while the server from out of the great bowl</l>
<l>Dippeth the mead, and beareth and poureth it into the beakers.</l></quote>
<bibl>Odyssey 9, 5 ff.</bibl>
</cit>


And as if this were not enough to express his
admiration, he makes his own opinion more evident,
rightly saying :—
<cit>
<quote>
<l>This is a thing that to me in my heart doth seem very goodly.</l>
</quote>
<bibl>Odyssey 9, 11.</bibl>
</cit>


From what he says, he counts nothing else happy
but to be a parasite. And it was no ordinary man
to whom he ascribed these words, but the wisest of
them all. After all, if Odysseus had wished to commend the Stoic end, he could have said so when
he brought Philoctetes back from Lemnos, when he
sacked Troy, when he checked the Greeks in their
flight, when he entered Troy after flogging himself
and putting on wretched Stoic rags; but on those


<pb n="259"/>

occasions he did not call that a more delightful end !
Moreover, after he had entered into the Epicurean
life once more in Calypso’s isle, when he had it in
his power to live in idleness and luxury, to dally
with the daughter of Atlas, and to enjoy every
pleasurable emotion, even then he did not call that
end more delightful, but the life of a parasite, who
at that time was called a banqueter. What does he
say, then? It is worth while to cite his verses once
more, for there is nothing like hearing them said over
and over: “banqueters sitting in regular order,” and:

<quote>
<l part="F">by each man is a table</l>
<l part="I">Laden with bread and with meat.</l>
</quote>

@

As to Epicurus, quite shamelessly filching the end
of Parasitic, he makes it the end of his conception
of happiness. That the thing is plagiarism, and that
pleasure does not concern Epicurus at all, but does
concern the parasite, you can assure yourself from
this line of reasoning. I for'my part consider that
pleasure is first of all the freedom of the flesh from
discomfort, and secondly, not having the spirit full
of turbulence and commotion. Now then, each of
these things is attained by the parasite, but neither
by Epicurus. For with his inquiries about the shape
of the earth, the infinitude of the universe, the magnitude of the sun, distances in space, primal elements,
and whether the gods exist or not, and with his continual strife and bickering with certain persons about
the end itself, he is involved not only in the troubles

<pb n="261"/>

of man but in those of the universe. The parasite,
however, thinking that everything is all right and
thoroughly convinced it would not be any better if
it were other than as it is, eats and sleeps in great
peace and comfort, with nothing of that sort annoying him, flat on his back, with his arms and legs
flung out, like Odysseus sailing home from Scheria.1

@
Again, it is not only in this way that pleasure
is foreign to Kpicurus, but in another way. This
Epicurus, whoever the learned gentleman is, either
has or has not his daily bread. Now if he has not,
it is not a question of living a life of pleasure; he
will not even live! But if he has, he gets it either
from his own larder or that of someone else. Now
if he gets his daily bread from someone else, he is a
parasite and not what he calls himself; but if he
gets it from his own larder, he will not lead a life of
pleasure.
TYCHIADES
Why not?
SIMON
If he gets his daily bread from his own larder,
many are the unpleasantnesses which must needs
attend such a life, Tychiades! Just see how many!
A man who intends to shape his life by pleasure
should satisfy all the desires that arise in him. What
do you say to that?
TYCHIADES
I agree with you.
SIMON
Therefore the man of vast means no doubt has
the opportunity of doing so, while the man of
little or no means has not; consequently a poor
1 Cf. Odyssey 13, 79, and 92.

<pb n="263"/>

man cannot become an adept or attain the end, that
is to say, pleasure. Even the rich man, however, .
who through his wealth ministers lavishly to his ©
desires, cannot attain that. Why? Because quite
inevitably, when a man spends his money, he becomes
involved in many an unpleasantness, at one moment
quarrelling with his cook for preparing the meat
badly—or else if he does not quarrel, eating poor
food on that account and coming short of his
pleasure—and the next moment quarrelling with
the man who manages his household affairs, if he
does not manage them well. Is not that so?
TYCHIADES
Yes, by Zeus, I agree with you.
SIMON
Now Epicurus is likely to have all this happen to
him, so that he will never reach the end. But the
parasite has no cook with whom to lose his temper,
nor lands nor house nor money over the loss of
which to be vexed, so that he alone can eat and
drink without being annoyed by any of the matters
which inevitably annoy the rich.
@

That Parasitic is an art has been well enough
demonstrated by means of this argument and the
others. It remains to show that it is the best art,
and not simply this, but first that it excels all the
other arts put together, and then that it excels each
of them individually.</p>

<p>
It excels all put together for this reason. Every
art has to be prefaced by study, hardships, fear and

<pb n="265"/>

floggings, from which everyone would pray to be
delivered. But this art alone, it seems, can be
learned without hardships. Who ever went home
from a dinner in tears, as we see.some going home
from their schools? Who ever set out for a dinner
looking gloomy, like those who go to school? I
promise you, the parasite goes to dinner of his own
accord, with a right good will to exercise his art,
while those who are learning the other arts hate
them so much that some run away from home on
account of them !</p>

<p>
Again, should you not note that when pupils make
progress in those arts, their fathers and mothers give
them as special rewards what they give the parasite
every day? ‘“By Zeus, the boy has written nicely,”
they say; “give him something to eat!”’ “He has
not written correctly; don’t give him anything!”
So highly is the thing esteemed, both as a reward
and by way of punishment.

@

Again, the other arts attain to this end late,
reaping their harvest of pleasure only after their
apprenticeship; for “the road to them leadeth
uphill’ and is long.1 Parasitic alone of them all
derives profit from the art immediately, in the
apprenticeship itself, and no sooner does it begin
than it is at its end.</p>

<p>
Moreover, the other arts, not merely in certain
cases but in every case, have come into existence to
provide support and nothing else, while the parasite
has his support immediately, as soon as he enters
upon his art. Do not you see that while the farmer
1 The quotation is from Hesiod, Works and Days 290, and
refers to the road that leads to virtue. The scholasticus, the
grey-headed student, was a familiar figure; see Lucian’s
Hermotimus.

<pb n="267"/>

does not farm for the sake of farming, nor the builder
build for the sake of building, the parasite does not
aim at something different; his work and its object
are one and the same thing.
@

Everybody knows, too, that those who ply the rest
of the arts drudge all the time except one or two
days a month which they celebrate as holidays,1 and
are said to have their good time then. But the
parasite celebrates thirty holidays a month, for he
thinks that every day belongs to the gods.
@

Furthermore, those who wish to be successful in
the other arts eat little and drink little, like invalids, and it is impossible to learn them while one
is rejoicing the inner man with plenty of food and
plenty of wine.
@

The other arts, moreover, cannot be of use to their
possessor without tools, for it is impossible to pipe
without a pipe or to strum without a lyre or to ride
without a horse ; but this one is so genial and presents so little difficulty to the artisan that even one
who has no tools can follow it.
@

And we pay, it is likely, for our lessons in the
other arts, but get paid in this one. 

@
Besides, the
other arts have teachers, but Parasitic has none;
like the Art of Poetry according to the definition
of Socrates, it comes by some divine dispensation.2

@
Reflect, too, that we cannot exercise the other arts
1 The manuscripts add: “and the cities too hold some
feasts once a year and others once a month.”
2 Plato, Ion 534 B-c.

<pb n="269"/>

while on a journey or a voyage, but this one can
be plied both on the road and at sea.
@

TYCHIADES
Quite true.
SIMON
Moreover, Tychiades, it seems to me that the other
arts stand in need of this one, but this one does not
stand in need of any other.1
TYCHIADES
But, I say, don’t you think that people who take
what belongs to someone else do wrong ?
SIMON
Certainly.
TYCHIADES
How is it, then, that the parasite is the only one
that does not do wrong in taking what belongs to
someone else?

@

SIMON
I can’t say !2— Again, in the other arts the first
steps are shabby and insignificant, but in Parasitic
the first step is a very fine one, for friendship, that
oft-lauded word, is nothing else, you will find, than
the first step in Parasitic.
TYCHIADES
What do you mean?
SIMON
That nobody invites an enemy or an unknown
person to dinner; not even a slight acquaintance. A
1 This point is not dwelt upon here because the author
proposes to use it with great effect later at the expense of
philosophy (§$ 31 ff.).
2 Fritzsche gives the two questions to Simon and the
answers to Tychiades, at the expense of a little rewriting.
Perhaps he is right, but it is rather too bad to lose the
humorous effect of the “I can’t say” in the mouth of
Simon, followed by the change of subject.

<pb n="271"/>

man must first, I take it, become a friend in order to
share another's bow] and board, and the mystic rites
of this art. Anyhow, I have often heard people say :
“How much of a friend is he, when he has neither
eaten nor drunk with us?”’ That is of course because they think that only one who has shared their
meat and drink is a trusty friend.
@
That in truth it is the most royal of the arts, you
can infer from this fact above all: men work at the
rest of them not only with discomfort and sweat
but actually sitting or standing, just as if they were
slaves to the arts, while the parasite plies his art
lying down, like a king!
@
What need is there, in speaking of his felicity, to
mention that he alone, according to wise Homer,
“neither planteth a plant with his hands nor
plougheth, but all, without sowing or ploughing,” 1
supply him with pasture?

@
Again, there is nothing to hinder a rhetorician or
a geometer or a blacksmith from working at his
trade whether he is a knave or a fool, but nobody
can be a parasite who is either a knave or a fool.
TYCHIADES
Goodness! What a fine thing you make out
Parasitic to be! I myself already want to be a
parasite, I think, rather than what I am.
@
SIMON
Well, that it excels all put together, I think I
1 Odyssey 9, 108-109.

<pb n="273"/>

have demonstrated. Come now, let us see how it
excels each individually. To compare it with the
vulgar arts is silly, and, in a way, more appropriate
to someone who is trying to belittle its dignity. We
must prove that it excels the finest and greatest
of them. It is universally admitted that rhetoric and
philosophy, which some people even make out to be
sciences because of their nobility, are the greatest.
Therefore, if I should prove that Parasitic is far
superior to these, obviously it will appear preeminent
among the other arts, like Nausicaa among her
handmaidens.1
@
It excels both rhetoric and philosophy, in the first
place in its objective reality ; for it has this, and they
have not. We do not hold one and the same view
about rhetoric; some of us call it an art, some a
want of art, others a depraved art, and others something else. So too with philosophy, which is not
uniform and consistent ; for Epicurus has on opinion
about things, the Stoics another, the Academics
another, the Peripatetics another; in brief, everybody claims that philosophy is something different,
and up to now, at all events, it cannot be said either
that the same men control opinion or that their art
is one. By this it is clear what conclusion remains to
be drawn. I maintain that there can be no art at all
which has not objective reality. For how else can you
1 Odyssey 6, 102-109.


<pb n="275"/>

explain it that arithmetic is one and the same, and
twice two is four not only here but in Persia, and
all its doctrines are in tune not only in Greece but
in strange lands, yet we see many different philosophies, all of them out of tune both in their beginnings and in their ends ?
TYCHIADES
You are right: they say philosophy is one, but
they themselves make it many.
@
SIMON
As far as the other arts are concerned, if there
should be some discord in them, one might pass it
over, thinking it excusable, since they are subordinate and their knowledges are not exempt from
change. But who could endure that philosophy
should not be one, and in better tune with itself
than a musical instrument? Well now, philosophy
is not one, for I see that it is infinitely many; yet
it cannot be many, for wisdom is one.
@
The same can be said, too, of the objective reality
of rhetoric. When all do not express the same views
about one subject, but there is a battle royal of contradictory declarations, that is the greatest proot
that the subject of which there is not a single definite conception does not exist at all ; for to enquire
whether it is this rather than that, and never to agree

<pb n="277"/>

that it is one, does away with the very existence of
the subject that is questioned.
@
This is not the case, however, with Parasitic.
Both among Greeks and among foreigners it is one
and uniform and consistent, and nobody can say that
it is practised in one way by this set of men and in
another by that set. Nor are there, it seems, among
parasites any sects like the Stoics or the Epicureans,
holding different doctrines; no, there is concord
among them all, and agreement in their works and
in their end. So to my thinking Parasitic may well
be, in this respect at least, actually wisdom.

@
TYCHIADES
It seems to me that you have put al] this very well.
But how do you prove that philosophy is inferior to
your art in other ways?
SIMON
Well, it must first be mentioned that no parasite
ever fell in love with philosophy ; but it is on record
that philosophersin great number have been fond of
Parasitic, and even to-day they love it!
TYCHIADES
Why, what philosophers can you mention that
have been eager to play parasite ?
SIMON
What philosophers, Tychiades? Though you know
them yourself, you pretend not to, and try to pull

<pb n="279"/>

the wool over my eyes, as if it brought them
disgrace instead of honour !
TYCHIADES
No, by Zeus, Simon ; I am very much at a loss as
to whom you can find to mention.
SIMON
My dear fellow, you seem to be unfamiliar with
their biographers, as otherwise you would certainly
be able to recognize whom I mean.
TYCHIADES
Well, anyhow, by Heracles, I long to find out now
who they are.
SIMON
I shall give you a list of them, and they are not
the riff-raff, but in my opinion the best, and those
whom you would least expect. 

@

Aeschines the
Socratic, the man who wrote the long and witty
dialogues, once went to Sicily, taking them with
him, in the hope that through them he might be
able to get acquainted with Dionysius the tyrant;
and after he had read his “Miltiades”’ and was
considered to have made a hit, he made himself at
home in Sicily from then on, playing parasite to the
tyrant and bidding adieu to the haunts of Socrates.
@

And what about Aristippus of Cyrene? Is he not
in your opinion one of the philosophers of distinction ?
TYCHIADES
Very much so.
SIMON
But he too lived in Syracuse at about the same
time, playing parasite to Dionysius. In fact, of all

<pb n="281"/>

the parasites he was in highest favour with him, —
being, to be sure, somewhat more gifted for the art
than the rest of them, so that Dionysius sent his
cooks to him every day, to learn something from
him.</p>

<p>
Aristippus, indeed, appears to have been a worthy
ornament to the art ;

@
 but your most noble Plato also
came to Sicily for this purpose, and after being
parasite to the tyrant only a few days, was turned
out of his place as parasite on account of ineptitude.
Then, after going back to Athens and working hard
and preparing himself, he cruised once more to
Sicily on a second venture, and again, after only a —
few days of dining, was turned out on account of
stupidity ; and this “Sicilian disaster” of Plato’s is
considered equal to that of Nicias.
TYCHIADES
Why, who tells about this, Simon ?
@
SIMON
A great many; among them, Aristoxenus the
musician, who deserves great consideration.1
That Euripides was parasite to Archelaus until he
died, and Anaxarchus to Alexander, you surely
know. 

@
As to Aristotle, he only made a beginning
in Parasitic, as in every other art.
@
I have shown that, as I said, philosophers have
been eager to play parasite; but nobody can
instance a parasite who has cared to practise philosophy.
1 The MSS. add: “and he himself was parasite to
Neleus.” Both were pupils of Aristotle. Aristoxenus wrote
a life of Plato, which was used by Diogenes Laertius.

<pb n="283"/>
@
Furthermore, if happiness lies in not hungering
or thirsting or shivering, nobody has this in his
power except the parasite. Consequently you can
find many cold and hungry philosophers, but never
a parasite; otherwise he would not be a parasite,
but an unfortunate beggar fellow, resembling a
philosopher.
@
TYCHIADES
You have been sufficiently explicit on that score.
But how do you prove that Parasitic excels
philosophy and rhetoric in other respects ?
SIMON
There are seasons, my dear fellow, in the life of
man, seasons of peace, I take it, and again seasons
of war. Well, in those seasons it is absolutely inevitable that the arts and those who possess them
should show what they are. First, if you please, let
us consider the season of war, and what class of men
would be above all most useful to themselves individually and to the state in general.

TYCHIADES
What a searching test of manhood you are
announcing! I have long been laughing inwardly
to think how a philosopher would look in comparison
with a parasite.
@
SIMON
Then in order to prevent you from wondering too
much and also from thinking it a laughing matter,
let us imagine that right here in our city
proclamation has been made that the enemy has
unexpectedly invaded the country; that it is

<pb n="285"/>

necessary to take the field against them and not
allow the farm-lands outside the walls to be laid
waste, that the commander has called to the colours
all those of military age, and that of course
everybody is going, including certain philosophers
and rhetoricians and parasites. First, then, let us
strip them to the skin; for those who are going to
put on armour must first take off their clothes.
Now inspect your men, sir, one by one, and give
them a physical examination. Some of them you
can see to be thin and pale through privation, shuddering, and as limp as if they had already been
wounded. Surely it would be ridiculous to say that
fighting, hand-to-hand combat, pushing, dust, and.
wounds can be borne by men like these, who need
something to brace them up! 

@

Pass on, and now see
how the parasite looks! In the first place, is he not
generous in his proportions and pleasing in his
complexion, neither dark nor fair of skin; for the
one befits a woman, and the other a slave; and
besides, has he not a spirited look, with a fiery
glance like mine, high and bloodshot? It is not
becoming, you know, to go into battle with a
timorous and womanish eye. Would not such a man
make a fine soldier in life and a fine corpse if he
should die ?1

@
But what is the good of guessing about all this,
when we have historical examples? To put it
briefly, in war, of all the rhetoricians and_philosophers that ever were, some have not dared to go
outside the walls at all, and if any one of them ever
took the field under compulsion, he deserted his
post, I maintain, and beat a retreat.
1 Cf. Tyrtaeus 8, 29-30, and § 55.

<pb n="287"/>

TYCHIADES
What assertions, all surprising and none moderate !
But say your say, nevertheless.
SIMON
Among the followers of rhetoric, Isocrates not only
never went to war but never even went to court,
through cowardice, I assume, as that is why he could
not even keep his voice.1 And did not Demades
and Aeschines and Philocrates, through fright,
directly upon the declaration of war against Philip,
betray their city and themselves to Philip and
continually direct public affairs at Athens in the
interest of that man, who was waging war upon the
Athenians at that time, if ever a man was; and
he was their friend. Moreover, Hyperides and
Demosthenes and Lycurgus, who put up a more
courageous front and were always making an uproar
and abusing Philip in the assemblies—what on earth
did they do that was valiant in the war with him?
Hyperides and Lycurgus did not even take the
field—why, they did not even dare to show their
heads just outside the gates, but safe within the
walls, they sat at home as if the city were already
besieged, framing trivial motions and petty resolutions! And as for the topmost of them, the
man who was continually talking in the assembly
about “Philip, the scoundrel from Macedon, where
one could never even buy a decent slave!” 2 he did
1 Every schoolboy knew—such was the interest in rhetoric—
that Isocrates did not practise in the courts because his voice
was too weak. The author pretends to think that its weakness must have been due to fright, and that therefore he was
a terrible coward.

<pb n="289"/>

venture to join the advance into Boeotia, but before
the armies joined battle and began to fight at close
quarters he threw away his shield and fled!1 Has
nobody ever told you that before? It is very well
known, not only to the Athenians, but to the people
of Thrace and Scythia, where that vagabond came
from.2

@

TYCHIADES
I know all that. They were orators, however, who
cultivated speech-making, not virtue. What have
you to say about the philosophers? Surely you are
not able to censure them as you did the others.
SIMON
They in turn, Tychiades, though they talk every
day about courage and wear the word virtue smooth,
will be found far more cowardly and effeminate than
the orators. Look at it from this standpoint. Inthe
first place, there is nobody that can mention a
philosopher who died in battle ; either they did not
enter the service at all, or if they did, every one of
them ran away. Antisthenes, Diogenes, Crates, Zeno,
Plato, Aeschines, Aristotle, and all that motley array
never even saw a line of battle. The only one who
had the courage to go out for the battle at Delium,
their wise Socrates, fled the field, fleeing for cover all
the way from Parnes to the gymnasium of Taureas.3
1 The story that Demosthenes played the coward at
Chaeronea was spread by his political enemies Aeschines
(3, 244; 253) and Pytheas (Plut. Demosth. 20); see also
Gellius 17, 21.
2 Cleobule, the mother of Demosthenes, was said to be
Scythian on her mother’s side (Aesch. 3, 171).
3 As a matter of fact Socrates displayed conspicuous valour
in the retreat from Delium. (Plato, Laches 181 B). The
allusion to the gymnasium of Taureas rests upon a hazy recollection of the opening of the Charmides, where Socrates
says that he visited it on the morning after his return from
Pole Furthermore, there were no Spartan troops at
Delium.


<pb n="291"/>

He thought it far nicer to sit and philander with
boys and propound petty sophistries to anyone who
should come along than to fight with a Spartan
soldier.
TYCHIADES
My excellent friend, I have already heard this
from others, who certainly did not wish to ridicule
or libel them; so I do not in the least think that
you are belying them out of partiality to your own
art. 
@

But if you are now willing, tell what the
parasite is like in war, and whether anybody at all
among the ancient heroes is said to have been a
parasite.1
SIMON
Why, my dear friend, no one is so unfamiliar with
Homer, even if he is completely unlettered, as not to
know that in him the noblest of the heroes are
parasites! The famous Nestor, from whose tongue
speech flowed like honey, was parasite to the king’
himself; and neither Achilles, who seemed and was
the finest in physique, nor Diomed nor Ajax was so
lauded and admired by Agamemnon as Nestor. He
does not pray to have ten of Ajax or ten of Achilles,
but says that he would long ago have taken Troy if
he had had ten soldiers like that parasite, old as he
was.2 Idomeneus, too, the son of Zeus, is similarly
spoken of as parasite to Agamemnon.3
1 The first orators were found in Homer; notably Odysseus,
Nestor, Menelaus. Alsothe beginnings of philosophy (Philod. 2, frg. xxi). So the first parasites should be found there.
2 Iliad 2, 371-374. 
3 Iliad 4, 257-263.

<pb n="293"/>
@
TYCHIADES
Of course I myself know all this, but I do not
think that I yet see how the two men were parasites
to Agamemnon.
SIMON
Remember, my friend, those lines that Agamemnon
himself addresses to Idomeneus.
TYCHIADES
What lines?
SIMON

<cit>
<quote>
    <l part="F">Your beaker has always</l>
    <l>Stood full, even as mine, to be drunk when the spirit should move you.</l>
</quote>

</cit>

For in saying there that the beaker “always stood
full,’ he did not mean that Idomeneus’ cup stood full
under all circumstances, even when he fought or
when he slept, but that he alone was privileged to
eat with the king all the days of his life, unlike
the rest of the soldiers, who were invited only on
certain days.
As for Ajax, when he had fought gloriously in

Homer says, and by way of
special honour, he was at last counted worthy of
sharing the king’s table. But Idomeneus and Nestor
dined with the king daily, as he himself says.
Nestor, indeed, in my opinion was the most workmanlike and efficient parasite among the kings; he
began the art, not in the time of Agamemnon, but
away back in the time of Caeneus and Exadius,1
1  Two generations earlier ; Iliad 1, 250, 264.

<pb n="295"/>

and by all appearances would never have stopped
practising it if Agamemnon had not been killed.
TYCHIADES
He was a doughty parasite, I grant you. Try to
name some more, if you know of any.

@

SIMON
What, Tychiades, was not Patroclus parasite to
Achilles, and that too although he was quite as fine
a young man, both in spirit and in physique, as any
of the other Greeks? For my part I think I am
right in concluding from his deeds that he was not
even inferior to Achilles himself. When Hector
broached the gates and was fighting within them
beside the ships, it was he that thrust him out and
extinguished the ship of Protesilaus, which was
already in flames. Yet the fighters who manned
that ship were not the most cowardly of all: they
were the sons of Telamon, Ajax and Teucer, one of
whom was a good spearman, the other a good archer.
And he slew many of the barbarians, among them
Sarpedon, the son of Zeus, this parasite of Achilles!
In his death too, he was not to be compared with the
others. Achilles slew Hector, man to man, and Paris ©
slew Achilles himself, but it needed a god and two
men to slay the parasite.1 And in dying, the words
that he uttered were not like those of noble Hector,
who humbled himself before Achilles and besought
that his body be given back to his family ; no, they
1 Apollo, Hector, and Euphorbus, Hector’s squire 7 Iliad
16, 849-850.

were the sort of words that a parasite would naturally
utter. What were they, do you ask?

TYCHIADES
Enough said as to that; but try to show that
Patroclus was not the friend but ‘the parasite of
Achilles.
SIMON
I shall cite you Patroclus himself, Tychiades,
saying that he was a parasite.
TYCHIADES
That is a surprising statement.
SIMON
Listen then to the lines themselves:

<cit>
<quote>
    <l>Let my bones not lie at a distance from thine, O Achilles :</l>
    <l>Let them be close to your side, as I lived in the house of our kindred.</l>

    <l>Kept me with kindliest care, and gave me the name of thy servant.</l>
</quote>
<bibl>Iliad 23, 89.</bibl>

That is, he maintained him as a parasite. If he
had wanted to call Patroclus a friend, he would not
have given him the name of servant, for Patroclus
was a freeman. Whom, then, does he mean by
 
  


<pb n="299"/>

servants, if not either friends or slaves? Parasites,
evidently. In the same way he calls Meriones too a
servant of Idomeneus,1</p>

<p>
Observe also tliat in the same passage it is not
Idomeneus, the son of Zeus, whom he thinks fit to
call “unyielding in battle,” but Meriones, his
parasite.2

@

Again, was not Aristogeiton, who was a man of
the people and a pauper, as Thucydides says, parasite
to Harmodius?3 Was he not his lover also? Naturally
parasites are lovers of those who support them.
Well, this parasite restored the city of Athens to
freedom when she was in bondage to a tyrant, and
now his statue stands in bronze in the public square
along with that of his favourite.</p>

<p>
Certainly these men, who were of such distinction,
were very doughty parasites.

@

What is your own inference as to the character of
the parasite in war? In the first place, does he not
get his breakfast before he leaves his quarters to fall
in, just as Odysseus thinks it right to do? Under no
other circumstances, he says, is it possible to continue
fighting in battle even if one should be obliged to
begin fighting at the very break of day.4 While the
other soldiers in affright are adjusting their helmets
with great pains, or putting on their breastplates, or
quaking in sheer anticipation of the horrors of war,
the parasite eats with a very cheerful visage; and
directly after marching out he begins to fight in the first line. The man who supports him is posted in
the second line, behind the parasite, who covers
1 Iliad 13, 246.
2 Iliad 13, 295.
3 Thucydides 6, 54,2. 
4 Iliad 19, 160-163.

<pb n="301"/>

him with his shield as Ajax covered Teucer, and
when missiles are flying exposes himself to protect
his patron; for he prefers to save his patron rather
than himself.

@

If a parasite should actually fall in battle, certainly
neither captain nor private soldier would be ashamed
of his huge body, elegantly reclining as at an elegant
banquet. Indeed it would be worth one’s while to
look at a philosopher’s body lying beside it, lean,
squalid, with a long beard, a sickly creature dead
before the battle! Who would not despise this city
if he saw that her targeteers were such wretches?
Who, when he saw pale, long-haired varlets lying
on the field, would not suppose that the city for
lack of reserves had freed for service the malefactors
in her prison?
That is how parasites compare with rhetoricians
and philosophers in war.

@

 In peace, it seems to me,
Parasitic excels philosophy as greatly as peace itself
excels war.
First, if you please, let us consider the strongholds
of peace.
TYCHIADES
I do not understand what that means, but let us
consider it all the same.
SIMON
Well, I should say that market-places, law-courts,
athletic fields, gymnasia, hunting-parties and dinners
were a city’s strongholds.

<pb n="303"/>

TYCHIADES
To be sure.
SIMON
The parasite does not appear in the market-place
or the courts because, I take it, all these points are
more appropriate to swindlers, ‘and because nothing
that is done in them is good form; but he frequents
the athletic fields, the gymnasia, and the dinners,
and ornaments them beyond all others. On the
athletic field what philosopher or rhetorician, once
he has taken his clothes off, is fit to be compared
with a parasite’s physique? What one of them
when seen in the gymnasium is not actually a
disgrace to the place? In the wilds, too, none of
them could withstand the charge of a beast; the
parasite, however, awaits their attack and receives it
easily, having learned to despise them at dinners ;
and neither stag nor bristling boar affrights him, but
if the boar whets his tusks for him, the parasite
whets his own for the boar! After a hare he is as
keen as a hound. And at a dinner, who could
compete with a parasite either in making sport or in
eating? Who would make the guests merrier? He
with his songs and jokes, or a fellow who lies there
without a smile, in a short cloak, with his eyes upon
the ground, as if he had come to a funeral and not
to a banquet? In my opinion, a philosopher at a
banquet is much the same thing as a dog in a bathhouse !

@

Come now, let us dismiss these topics and forthwith turn to the parasite’s way of living, considering
at the same time and comparing with it that of
the others.</p>

<p>
In the first place, you can see that the parasite

<pb n="305"/>

always despises reputation and does not care at
all what people think about him, but you will find
that rhetoricians and philosophers, not merely here
and there but everywhere, are harassed by selfesteem and reputation—yes, not only by reputation,
but what is worse than that, by money! The parasite feels greater contempt for silver than one would
feel even for the pebbles on the beach, and does not
think gold one whit better than fire. The rhetoricians, however, and what is more shocking, those
who claim to be philosophers, are so wretchedly
affected by it that among the philosophers who are .
most famous at present—for why should we speak
of the rhetoricians ?—one was convicted of taking
a bribe when he served on a jury, and another
demands pay from the emperor as a private tutor ;
he is not ashamed that in his old age he resides
in a foreign land on this account and works for
wages like an Indian or Scythian prisoner of war
—not even ashamed of the name that he gets
by it.1

@

You will find too that they are subject to other
passions as well as these, such as distress, anger,
jealousy, and all manner of desires. The parasite is
far from all this; he does not become angry because
he is long-suffering, and also because he has nothing
to get angry at; and if he should become indignant
at any time, his temper does not give rise to any
unpleasantness or gloom, but rather to laughter, and
makes the company merry. He is least of all subject
1 The allusion is uncertain. The emperor is probably
Marcus Aurelius ; if so, the philosopher may be Sextus of
Chaeronea, or the Apollonius whom Lucian mentions in
Demonax 31.

<pb n="307"/>

to distress, as his art supplies him gratuitously with
the advantage of having nothing to be distressed
about. For he has neither money nor house nor
servant nor wife nor children, over which, if they go
to ruin, it is inevitable that their possessor should —
be distressed. And he has no desires, either for
reputation or money, or even for a_ beautiful
favourite.

@

TYCHIADES
But, Simon, at least he is likely to be distressed by
lack of food.
SIMON
You fail to understand, Tychiades, that a priori:
one who lacks food is not a parasite. A brave man
is not brave if he lacks bravery, nor is a sensible man
sensible if he lacks sense. On any other supposition .
the parasite would not exist ; and the subject of our
investigation is an existent, not a non-existent
parasite. If the brave man is brave for no other
reason than because he has bravery at his command,
and the sensible man because he has sense at his
command, so, too, the parasite is a parasite because
he has food at his command ; consequently, if this
be denied him, we shall be studying some other sort
of man instead of a parasite.
TYCHIADES
Then a parasite will never lack food ?
SIMON
So it appears ; therefore he cannot be distressed,
either by that or by anything else whatsoever.
3°97
<pb n="309"/>
@
Moreover, all the philosophers and rhetoricians, to
a man, are particularly timid. At all events you will
find that most of them appear in public with a staff
—of course they would not have armed themselves
if they were not afraid—-and that they lock their
doors very securely for fear that someone might plot
against them at night. The parasite, however,
casually closes the door of his lodgings, just to prevent it from being opened by the wind, and when a
sound comes at night, he is no more disturbed than
as if it had not come, and when he goes through unfrequented country he travels without a sword; for .
he does not fear anything anywhere. But I have
often seen philosophers armed with bows and arrows
when there was nothing to fear; and as for staves,
they carry them even when they go to the bath and
to luncheon.

@


Again, nobody could accuse a parasite of adultery
or assault or larceny or any other offence at all, since
a man of that character would be no parasite; he
wrongs himself. Therefore if he should commit
adultery, for instance, along with the offence he
acquires the name that goes withit. Just as a good
man who behaves badly thereby acquires the name
of bad instead of good, so, I take it, if the parasite
commits any offence, he loses his identity and becomes identified with his offence. But not only are
we ourselves aware of such offences on the part of
rhetoricians and philosophers committed without
3°9
<pb n="311"/>

number in our times, but we also possess records of
their misdeeds left behind in books. And there are
speeches in defence of Socrates, Aeschines, Hyperides,
Demosthenes, and very nearly the majority of orators
and sages, whereas there is no speech in defence of a
parasite, and nobody can cite a suit that has been
brought against a parasite.

@

Granted that the life of a parasite is better than
that of a rhetorician or a philosopher, is his death
worse? Quite to the contrary, it is happier by far.
We know that most, if not all, of the philosophers
died as wretchedly as they had lived; some died by
poison, as a result of judicial sentence, after they had
been convicted of the greatest crimes; some had
their bodies completely consumed by fire; some
wasted away through retention of urine; some died
in exile.1 But in the case of a parasite no one can
cite any such death—nothing but the happy, happy
death of a man who has eaten and drunk; and any
one of them who is thought to have died by violence:
died of indigestion.

@

TYCHIADES
You have satisfactorily championed the cause of
the parasite against the philosophers. Next try to
explain whether he is a good and useful acquisition to
his supporter ; for to me it seems that the rich play
the part of benefactors and philanthropists in supporting them, and that this is dishonourable to the
man who receives support.
SIMON
How silly df you, Tychiades, not to be able to
1 Socrates ;. Empedocles (sod. Peregrinns Proteus) ; Epicurus; Aristotle.

<pb n="313"/>

realise that a rich man, even if he has the wealth of
Gyges, is poor if he eats alone ; that if he takes the
gir without a parasite in his company he is considered
a pauper, and that just as a soldier without-arms, or
a mantle without a purple border, or a horse without trappings is held in less esteem, so a rich man
without a parasite appears low and cheap. Truly,
he is an ornament to the rich man, but the rich
man is never an ornament to the parasite. 

@

Furthermore, it is no disgrace to him to be the rich man’s
parasite, as you imply, evidently assuming that
he is the inferior and the other a superior;
since surely it is profitable for the rich man to
support the parasite, seeing that, besides having him
as an ornament, he derives great security from his
service as bodyguard. In battle nobody would readily
attack the rich man while he saw the other standing
by, and in fact no one could die by poison who had a_
parasite ; for who would dare to make an attempt on
a man when a parasite tastes his meat and drink first ? 
So the rich man not only is ornamented but is
actually saved from the greatest: perils by the
parasite, who faces every danger on account of his
affection, and will not suffer the rich man to eat
alone, but chooses even to die from eating with him.

requires very little effort, now that we too are inclined to
believe in supernatural manifestations. To be sure, the
other world manifested itself to men in those days through
somewhat different channels ; but the phenomena, then as
now, were considered extremely well authenticated, and were
credited by men of high standing. Take but one example,
the younger Pliny. In a famous letter, which should be
read in full (7, 27), he asks Licinius Sura for his opinion
about phantasmatu, citing as well vouched for by others
the story of Curtius Rufus (told also by Tacitus: Annals
11, 21) and that of the haunted house, which we find in
Lucian, and then relating two invidents that happened in
his own family: in both cases a boy dreamed that his hair
was being cut, and awoke in the morning to find it lying on
the pillow beside him. Pliny does not seek a rationalistic
explanation in the pranks of pages; he takes the incidents
very seriously, and surely does not expect either Sura or
the general public to do otherwise. Eucrates is Pliny’s
spiritual grandson.</p>
<p>Lucian’s auditors, too, were credulous, and whether they
fully believed such tales or not, anyhow they were eager to
listen to them. Lucian for his part was uncommonly eager
to repeat them because he was quite aware that he could do
it very well. Was he to be debarred from that privilege
simply because he did not believe in them? Not he! He
could kill two birds with a single lucky ‘stone, for he could
tell what his audience craved to hear, and at the same time
he and they could laugh at those who liked to tell and hear
such stories. The inclusiveness of the satire is clearly shown
in its last words. Both Tychiades and Philocles confess that
they have been bitten with the prevailing mania.</p></note></head>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="1"><p>

Can you tell me, Philocles, what in the world it is
that makes many men so fond of lying that they
delight in telling preposterous tales themselves and
listen with especial attention to those who spin yarns
of that sort?
PHILOCLES
There are many reasons, Tychiades, which constrain
men occasionally to tell falsehoods with an eye to
the usefulness of it.
TYCHIADES
That has nothing to do with the case, as the phrase
is, for I did not ask about men who lie for advantage.
They are pardonable—yes, even praiseworthy, some
of them, who have deceived national enemies or for
safety’s sake have used this kind of expedient in
extremities, as Odysseus often did in seeking to win
his own life and the return of his comrades.1 No,
my dear sir, I am speaking of those men who put
sheer useless lying far ahead of truth, liking the
thing and whiling away their time at it without any
valid excuse. I want to know about these men, to
what end they do this.

@
PHILOCLES
Have you really noted any such men anywhere in
whom this passion for lying is ingrained ?
TYCHIADES
Yes, there are many such men.
PHILOCLES
What other reason, then, than folly may they be
said to have for telling untruths, since they choose
the worst course instead of the best? —
TYCHIADES
That too has nothing to do with the case, Philocles,
for I could show you many men otherwise sensible
and remarkable for their intelligence who have somehow become infected with this plague and are lovers
of lying, so that it irks me when such men, excellent
in every way, yet delight in deceiving themselves
and their associates. Those of olden time should be
known to you before I mention them— Herodotus,
and Ctesias of Cnidus, and before them the poets,
including Homer himself—men of renown, who made
use of the written lie, so that they not only deceived
those who listened to them then, but transmitted the
falsehood from generation to generation even down
to us, conserved in the choicest of diction and rhythm.
For my part it. often occurs to me to blush for them
when they tell of the castration of Uranus, and the
fetters of Prometheus, and the revolt of the Giants,
and the whole sorry show in Hades, and how Zeus
turned into a bull or a swan on account of a loveaffair, and how some woman changed into a bird or a

<pb n="325"/>

bear; yes, andof Pegasi, Chimaerae, Gorgons, Cyclopes,
and so forth—very strange and wonderful fables, fit
to enthrall the souls of children who still dread
Mormo and Lamia.
@

Yet as far as the poets are concerned, perhaps the
case is not so bad; but is it not ridiculous that even
cities and whole peoples tell lies unanimously and
officially ? The Cretans exhibit the tomb of Zeus and
are not ashamed of it, and the Athenians assert that
Erichthonius sprang from the earth and that the first
men came up out of the soil of Attica like vegetables ;
but at that their story is much more dignified than
that of the Thebans, who relate that ““Sown Men”
grew up from serpents’ teeth. If any man, however,
does not think that these silly stories are true, but
sanely puts them to the proof and holds that only a
Coroebus or a Margites1 can believe either that
Triptolemus drove through the air behind winged
serpents, or that Pan came from Arcadia to Marathon
to take a hand in the battle, or that Oreithyia was
carried off by Boreas, they consider that man a sacrilegious fool for doubting facts so evident and genuine ;
to such an extent does falsehood prevail.

@

PHILOCLES
Well, as far as the poets are concerned, Tychiades,
and the cities too, they may properly be pardoned.
The poets flavour their writings with the delectability
that the fable yields, a most seductive thing, which
they need above all else for the benefit of their
readers ; and the Athenians, Thebans and others, if
1 Coroebus is known as a typical fool only from this
passage, and the scholion upon it, which attributes to him a
story told elsewhere of Margites, the hero of the dost mockepic ascribed to Homer.

any there be, make their countries more impressive
by such means. In fact, if these fabulous tales
should be taken away from Greece, there would be
nothing to prevent the guides there from starving to
death, as the foreigners would not care to hear the
truth, even gratis! On the other hand, those who
have no such motive and yet delight in lying may
properly be thought utterly ridiculous.

@
TYCHIADES
You are quite right in what you say. For example,
I come to you from Eucrates the magnificent, having
listened to a great lot of incredible yarns; to put it
more accurately, I took myself off in the midst of
the conversation because I could not stand the
exaggeration of the thing: they drove me out as if
they had been the Furies by telling quantities of
extraordinary miracles.
PHILOCLES
But, Tychiades, Eucrates is a trustworthy person,
and nobody could ever believe that he, with such a
long beard, a man of sixty, and a great devotee of
philosophy too, would abide even to hear someone
else tell a lie in his presence, let alone venturing to
do anything of that sort himself.
TYCHIADES
Why, my dear fellow, you do not know what sort
of statements he made, and how he confirmed them,
and how he actually swore to most of them, taking
oath upon his children, so that as I gazed at him all
sorts of ideas came into my head, now that he was
insane and out of his right mind, now that he was
only a fraud, after all, and I had failed, in all these

<pb n="329"/>

years, to notice that his lion’s skin covered a silly
ape; so extravagant were the stories that he told.
PHILOCLES
What were they, Tychiades, in the name of Hestia?1
I should like to know what sort of quackery he has
been screening behind that great beard.

@
TYCHIADES
I used to visit. him previously, Philocles, whenever I had a good deal of leisure; and to-day, when I
wanted to find Leontichus, a close friend of mine, as
you know, and was told by his boy that he had gone
off to the house of Eucrates in the early morning to
pay him a call because he was ill, I went there for
two reasons, both to find Leontichus and to see
Eucrates, for I had not known that he was ill.</p>

<p>
I did not find Leontichus there, for he had just
gone out a little while before, they said ; but I found
plenty of others, among whom there was Cleodemus
the Peripatetic, and Deinomachus the Stoic, and Ion
—you know the one that thinks he ought to be
admired for his mastery of Plato’s doctrines as the
only person who has accurately sensed the man’s
meaning and can expound it to the rest of the world.
You see what sort of men I am naming to you, allwise and all-virtuous, the very fore-front of each
school, every one venerable, almost terrible, to look
at. In addition, the physician Antigonus was there,
called in, I suppose, by reason of the illness. Eucrates
seemed to be feeling better already, and the ailment
was of a chronic character; he had had another attack
of rheumatism in his feet. 
1 The oath amounts to “In the name of friendship.”

<pb n="331"/>
</p>

<p>
He bade me sit by him on the couch, letting his
voice drop a little to the tone of an invalid when he
saw me, although as I was coming in I heard him
shouting and vigorously pressing some point or other.
I took very good care not to touch his feet, and
after making the customary excuses that I did not
know he was ill and that when I learned of it I
came in hot haste, sat down beside him.
@
It so happened that the company had already, I
think, talked at some length about his ailment and
were then discussing it further; they were each
suggesting certain remedies, moreover. At any rate
Cleodemus said : “Well then, if you take up from the
ground in your left hand the tooth of the weasel
which has been killed in the way I have already
described and wrap it up in the skin of a lion just
flayed, and then bind it about your legs, the pain
ceases instantly.”

</p>

<p>
“Not in a lion’s skin, I was told,” said Deinomachus, “but that of a hind still immature and
unmated ; and the thing is more plausible that way,
for the hind is fleet and her strength lies especially
in her legs. The lion is brave, of course, and his fat
and his right fore-paw and the stiff bristles of his
whiskers are very potent if one knew how to use
them with the incantation appropriate to each ; but
for curing the feet he is not at all promising.”
</p>

<p>
“I myself,” said Cleodemus, “was of that opinion
formerly, that it ought to be the skin of a hind
because the hind is fleet ; but recently a man from

<pb n="333"/>

Libya, well informed in such things, taught me
better, saying that lions were fleeter than deer.
‘No fear!’ said he: ‘They even chase and catch
them!’”

@
The company applauded, in the belief that the
Libyan was right in what he said. But I said, “Do
you really think that certain incantations put a stop to
this sort of thing, or external applications, when the
trouble has its seat within?” They laughed at my
remark andclearly held meconvicted of great stupidity
if I did not know the most obvious things, of which
nobody in his right mind would maintain that they
were not so. The doctor Antigonus, however,
seemed to me to be pleased with my question, for
he had been overlooked a long time, I suppose,
when he wanted to aid Eucrates in a professional —
way by advising him to abstain from wine, adopt a
vegetarian diet, and in general to “lower his pitch.”

</p>

<p>
But Cleodemus, with a faint smile, said: ‘“What
is that, Tychiades? Do you consider it incredible
that any alleviations of ailments are effected by
such means?” “TI do,’ said I, “not being altogether full of drivel, so as to believe that external
remedies which have nothing to do with the internal
causes of the ailments, applied as you say in combination with set phrases and _ hocus-pocus of
some sort, are efficacious and bring on the cure.
That could never happen, not even if you should
wrap sixteen entire weasels in the skin of the Nemean
lion; in fact I have often seen the lion himself
limping in pain with his skin intact upon him!”

@
“You are a mere layman, you see,’ said Deinomachus, “and you have not made it a point to learn

<pb n="335"/>

how such things agree with ailments when they are
applied. I do not suppose you would accept even
the most obvious instances—periodic fevers driven
off, snakes charmed, swellings cured, and whatever
else even old wives do. But if all that takes
place, why in the world will you not believe that
this takes place by similar means?”
</p>

<p>
“You are reasoning from false premises, Deinomachus,” I replied, “and, as the saying goes, driving.
out one nail with another; for it is not clear that
precisely what you are speaking of takes place by
the aid of any such power. If, then, you do not
first convince me by logical proof that it takes place
in this way naturally, because the fever or the inflammation is afraid of a holy name or a foreign phrase
and so takes flight from the swelling, your stories
still remain old wives’ fables.”

@10

“It seems to me,” said Deinomachus, “that when
you talk like that you do not believe in the gods,
either, since you do not think that cures can be
effected through holy names.’ “Don’t say that, my
dear sir!” I replied. “Even though the gods exist,
there is nothing to prevent that sort of thing from
being false just the same. For my part, I revere the
gods and I see their cures and all the good that
they do by restoring the sick to health with drugs
and doctoring. In fact, Asclepius himself and his
sons ministered to the sick by laying on healing
drugs, not by fastening on lions’ skins and weasels.”1

@
“Never mind him,” said Ion, “and I will tell you
1 Iliad 4, 218; 11, 830.

<pb n="337"/>

a wonderful story. I was still a young lad, about
fourteen years old, when someone came and told
my father that Midas the vine-dresser, ordinarily a
strong and industrious servant, had been bitten by
a viper toward midday and was lying down, with his
leg already in a state of mortification. While he
was tying up the runners and twining them about
the poles, the creature had crawled up and bitten
him on the great toe; then it had quickly gone
down again into its hole, and he was groaning in
mortal anguish.

</p>

<p>
“As this report was being maile, we saw Midas
himself being brought up on a litter by his fellowslaves, all swollen and livid, with a clammy skin and
but little breath left in him. Naturally my father
was distressed, but a friend who was there said
to him: ‘Cheer up: I will at once go and get you
a Babylonian, one of the so-called Chaldeans, who
will cure the fellow.’ Not to make a long story of
it, the Babylonian came and brought Midas back
to life, driving the poison out of his body by a
spell, and also binding upon his foot a fragment
which he broke from the tombstone of a dead
maiden. 
</p>

<p>
“Perhaps this is nothing out of the common:
although Midas himself picked up the litter on
which he had been carried and went off to the farm,
so potent was the spell and the fragment of the
tombstone. 

@
But the Babylonian did other things that
were truly miraculous. Going to the farm in the early
morning, he repeated seven sacred names out of an
old book, purified the place with sulphur and torches,
going about. it three times, and called out all the


<pb n="339"/>

reptiles that there were inside the boundaries. They
came as if they were being drawn in response to the
spell, snakes in great numbers, asps, vipers, horned
snakes, darters, common toads, and puff-toads; one
old python, however, was missing, who on account
of his age, I suppose, could not creep out and so
failed to comply with the command. The magician
said that not all were there, and electing one of the
snakes messenger, the youngest, sent him after the
python, who presently came too. When they were
assembled, the Babylonian blew on them and they
were all instantly burned up by the blast, and we
were amazed.”

@
“Tell me, Ion,” said I, “did the messenger snake,
the young one, give his arm to the python, who you
say was aged, or did the python have a stick and
lean on it?”</p>

<p>
“You are joking,” said Cleodemus: “I myself
was formerly more incredulous than you in regard to
such things, for I thought it in no way possible that
they could happen; but when first I saw the foreign
stranger fly—he came from the land of the Hyperboreans, he said—, I believed and was conquered
after long resistance. What was I to do when I saw
him soar through the air in broad daylight and walk
on the water and go through fire slowly on foot?”
“Did you see that?’ said I—“the Hyperborean
flying, or stepping on the water?” “Certainly,”
said he, “with brogues on his feet such as people of
that country commonly wear. As for the trivial

<pb n="341"/>

feats, what is the use of telling all that he performed,
sending Cupids after people, bringing up supernatural beings, calling mouldy corpses to life, making
Hecate herself appear in plain sight, and pulling
down the moon? 

@

But after all, I will tell you what I
saw him do in the house of Glaucias, son of Alexicles.</p>

<p>
“Immediately after Glaucias’ father died and he
acquired the property, he fell in love with Chrysis,
the wife of Demeas. I was in his employ as his
tutor in philosophy, and if that love-affair had not
kept him too busy, he would have known all the
teachings of the Peripatetic school, for even at
eighteen he was solving fallacies and had completed
the course of lectures on natural philosophy.1 At
his wit’s end, however, with his love-affair, he told
me the whole story; and as was natural, since I was
his tutor, I brought him that Hyperborean magician
at a fee of four minas down (it was necessary to pay
something in advance towards the cost of the victims)
and sixteen if he should obtain Chrysis. The man
waited for the moon to wax, as it is then, for the
most part, that such rites are performed ; and after
digging a pit in an open court of the house, at about
midnight he first summoned up for us Alexicles,
Glaucias’ father, who had died seven months before.
The old gentleman was indignant over the love-affair .
and flew into a passion, but at length he permitted
him to go on with it after all. Next he brought up
Hecate, who fetched Cerberus with her, and he drew
down the moon, a many-shaped spectacle, appearing
differently at different times; for at first she
exhibited the form of a woman, then she turned into
a handsome bull, and then she looked like a puppy.
1 Aristotle’s Physics.

<pb n="343"/>

Finally, the Hyperborean made a little Cupid out of
Clay and said: ‘Go and fetch Chrysis.’ The clay took
wing, and before long Chrysis stood on the threshold
knocking at the door, came in and embraced Glaucias
as if she loved him furiously, and remained with him
until we heard the cocks crowing. Then the moon
flew up to the sky, Hecate plunged beneath the earth,
the other phantasms disappeared, and we sent Chrysis
home at just about dawn. 

@
If you had seen that,
Tychiades, you would no longer have doubted that
there is much good in spells.”</p>

<p>
“Quite so,” said I, “I should have believed if I
had seen it, but as things are I may perhaps be
pardoned if I am not able to see as clearly as you.
However, I know the Chrysis whom you speak of, an
amorous dame and an accessible one, and I do not
see why you needed the clay messenger and the
Hyperborean magician and the moon in person to
fetch her, when for twenty drachmas she could have
been brought to the Hyperboreans! The woman
is very susceptible to that spell, and her case is the
opposite to that of ghosts; if they hear a chink of
bronze or iron, they take flight, so you say, but as
for her, if silver chinks anywhere, she goes toward
the sound. Besides, I am surprised at the magician
himself, if he was able to have the love of the
richest women and get whole talents from them, and
yet made Glaucias fascinating, penny-wise that he is,
for four minas.”’

“You act ridiculously,” said Ion, “to doubt everything.

For my part, I should like to ask you what
you say to those who free possessed men from their
terrors by exorcising the spirits so manifestly. I
need not discuss this: everyone knows about the
Syrian from Palestine, the adept in it,1 how many he.
takes in hand who fall down in the light of the moon
and roll their eyes and fill their mouths with foam ;
nevertheless, he restores them to health and sends
them, away normal in mind, delivering them from
their straits for a large fee. When he stands beside
them as they lie there and asks: ‘Whence came
you into his body?’ the patient himself is silent,
but the spirit answers in Greek or in the language of
whatever foreign country he comes from, telling how
and whence he entered into the man; whereupon, by
adjuring the spirit and if he does not obey, threatening him, he drives him out. Indeed, I actually saw one
coming out, black and smoky in colour.” “It is
nothing much,” I remarked, “for you, Ion, to see
that kind of sight, when even the ‘ forms’? that the
father of your school, Plato, points out are plain to
you, a hazy object of vision to the rest of us, whose
eyes are weak.”
@
“Why, is Ion the only one who has seen that kind
of sight?” said Eucrates. “Have not many others
encountered spirits, some at night and some by day?
For myself, I have seen such things, not merely once
but almost hundreds of times. At first I was
disturbed by them, but now, of course, because of

their familiarity, I do not consider that I am seeing
anything out of the way, especially since the Arab
gave me the ring made of iron from crosses and
taught me the spell of many names. But perhaps
you will doubt me also, Tychiades.” “How could I
doubt Eucrates, the son of Deinon,” said I, “alearned
and an uncommonly independent gentleman, expressing his opinions in his own home, with complete 
liberty?” 

@
“Anyhow,” said Eucrates, “the affair of
the statue was observed every night by everybody
in the house, boys, young men and old men, and
you could hear about it not only from me but from
all our people.”” “Statue!” said I, ‘what do you
mean?”</p>

<p>
“Have you not observed on coming in,’ said he,
“avery fine statue set up in the hall, the work of
Demetrius, the maker of portrait-statues ?” “Do
you mean the discus-thrower,”’ said I, “the one bent
over in the position of the throw, with his head
turned back toward the hand that holds the discus,
with one leg slightly bent, looking as if he would
spring up all at once with the cast?” “Not that
one,” said he, “for that is one of Myron’s works, the
discus-thrower you speak of. Neither do I mean the
one beside it, the one binding his head with the
fillet, the handsome Jad, for that is Polycleitus’ work.
Never mind those to the right as you come in, among
which stand the tyrant-slayers, modelled’ by Critius
and Nesiotes; but if you noticed one beside the
fountain, pot-bellied, bald on the forehead, half
bared by the hang of his cloak, with some of the
hairs of his beard wind-blown and his veins prominent,
the image of a real man, that is the one I mean;

he is thought to be Pellichus, the Corinthian
general.”1

@

“Yes,” I said, “I saw one to the right of the spout,
wearing fillets and withered wreaths, his breast
covered with gilt leaves.” “I myself puton the gilt
leaves,’ said Eucrates, “when he cured me of the
ague that was torturing me to death every other day.”
“Really, is our excellent Pellichus a doctor also?”
said I. “Do not mock,” Eucrates replied, “or before
long the man will punish you. I know what virtue
there is in this statue that you make fun of. Don’t
you suppose that he can send fevers upon whomsoever
he will, since it is possible for him to send them
away?” “May the manikin be gracious and
kindly,” said I, “since he is so manful. But what
else does everyone in the house see him doing ?”</p>

“As soon as night comes,” he said, “he gets down
from the pedestal on which he stands and goes all
about the house; we all encounter him, sometimes
singing, and he has never harmed anybody. One has
but to turn aside, and he passes without molesting in
any way those who saw him. Upon my word, he
often takes baths and disports himself all night, so
that the water can be heard splashing.” 

“See here,

with that of Simon by the same Demetrius of Alopece, which
is mentioned in Aristophanes. It is surprisingly realistic
for so early a period. Furtwangler thought the description
inaccurate, but the statue may have been the work of some
later Demetrius. Certainly its identification as a portrait of
Pellichus was conjectural (δοκεῖ).

“See here, Tychiades,”
said he, “‘perhaps you will be sorry for your joke
later on.



 I know what happened to the man who
stole the obols that we offer him on the first of each
month.” “It ought to have been something very
dreadful,” said Ion, “since he committed a sacrilege.
How was he punished, Eucrates? I should like to
hear about it, no matter how much Tychiades here
is going to doubt it.”</p>

<p>
“A number of obols,” he said, “were lying at his
feet, and some other small coins of silver had been
stuck to his thigh with wax, and leaves of silver,
votive offerings or payment for a cure from one or
another of those who through him had ceased to be
subject to fever. We had a plaguy Libyan servant,
a groom; the fellow undertook to steal and did steal
everything that was there, at night, after waiting
until the statue had descended. But as soon as
Pellichus came back and discovered that he had been
robbed, mark how he punished and exposed the
Libyan! The unhappy man ran about the hall the
whole night long unable to get out, just as if he had
been thrown into a labyrinth, until finally he was
caught in possession of the stolen property when
daycame. He got a sound thrashing then, on being
caught, and he did not long survive the incident,
dying a rogue’s death from being flogged, he said,
every night, so that welts showed on his body the

next day. In view of this, Tychiades, mock Pellichus
and think me as senile as if I were a contemporary
of Minos!” “Well, Eucrates,” I said, “as long as
bronze is bronze and the work a product of Demetrius
of Alopece, who makes men, not gods, I shall never
be afraid of the statue of Pellichus, whom I should
not have feared very much even when he was alive
if he threatened me.”

Thereupon Antigonus, the physician, said, “I
myself, Eucrates, have a bronze Hippocrates about
eighteen inches high. As soon as the light is
out, he goes all about the house making noises,
turning out the vials, mixing up the medicines, and
overturning the mortar, particularly when we are
behindhand with the sacrifice which we make to
him every year.” “Has it gone so far,’ said I,
“that even Hippocrates the physician demands
sacrifice in his honour and gets angry if he is not
feasted on unblemished victims at the proper season ?
He ought to be well content if anyone should
bring food to his tomb or pour him a libation of
milk and honey or put a wreath about his gravestone !”

“Let me tell you,” said Eucrates, “—this, I assure
you, is supported by witnesses—what I saw five

the year; passing through the farm at midday, I left
the labourers gathering the grapes and went off by
myself into the wood, thinking about something in

woman half a furlong in height, a gigantic bugaboo!
For my part I was thinking in the meantime: “They
associate with young men to make them wise and
are admired by many, but what are they themselves?
Only their grey hair and their beard distinguishes
them from infants, and for the rest of it, even infants
are not so amenable to falsehood.” 

@
Deinomachus,
for instance, said: “Tell me, Eucrates, the dogs of
the goddess—how big were they ?”
“Taller than Indian elephants,” he replied ;
“black, like them, with a shaggy coat of filthy,
tangled hair.— Well, at sight of her I stopped, at
the same time turning the gem that the Arab gave
me to the inside of my finger, and Hecate, stamping


<pb n="357"/>

on the ground with her serpent foot, made a
tremendous chasm, as deep as Tartarus; then after
a little she leaped into it and was gone. I plucked up
courage and looked over, taking hold of a tree that
grew close by, in order that I might not get a dizzy
turn and fall into it headlong. Then I saw everything in Hades, the River of Blazing Fire, and the
Lake, and Cerberus, and the dead, well enough to
recognise some of them. My father, for instance, I
saw distinctly, still wearing the same clothes in
which we buried him.”</p>

“What were the souls doing, Eucrates?”’ said Ion.
“What else would they be doing,” he said, “except
lying upon the asphodel to while away the time, along
with their friends and kinsmen by tribes and clans ?”’
“Now let the Epicureans go on contradicting holy
Plato,” said Ion, “and his doctrine about the souls!
But you did not see Socrates himself and Plato among
the dead?” “Socrates I saw,” he replied, “and
even him not for certain but by guess, because he
was bald and pot-bellied ; Plato I could not recognise,
for one must tell the truth to friends, I take it.
</p>

<p>
“No sooner had I seen everything sufficiently well
than the chasm came together and closed up; and
some of the servants who were seeking me, Pyrrhias
here among them, came upon the scene before the
chasm had completely closed. Tell them, Pyrrhias,
whether I am speaking the truth or not.” “Yes,
by Heaven,” said Pyrrhias, “and I heard barking,
too, through the chasm and a gleam of fire was

<pb n="359"/>

shining, from the torch, I suppose.’ I had to laugh
when the witness, to give good measure, threw in
the barking and the fire!

@25
Cleodemus, however, said, “These sights that
you saw are not novel and unseen by anyone else,
for I myself when I was taken sick not long ago
witnessed something similar. Antigonus here visited
and attended me. It was the seventh day, and the
fever was like a calenture of the most raging type.
Leaving me by myself and shutting the door, they
all were waiting outside ; for you had given orders to
that: effect, Antigonus, on the chance that I might
fall asleep. Well, at that time there appeared at my
side while I lay awake a very handsome young man,
wearing a white cloak ; then, raising me to my feet,
he led me through a chasm to Hades, as I realised
at once when I saw Tantalus and Ixion and Tityus
and Sisyphus. Why should I tell you all the details?
But when I came to the court—Aeacus and Charon
and the Fates and the Furies were there—a person
resembling a king (Pluto, I suppose) sat reading off
the names of those about to die because their lease
of life chanced to have already expired. The young
man speedily set me before him; but Pluto was
angry and said to my guide: ‘ His thread is not yet
‘fully spun, so let him be off, and bring me the
blacksmith Demylus, for he is living beyond the
spindle.’ I hastened back with a joyful heart, and
from that time was free from fever ; but I told everyone that Demylus would die. He lived next door
to us, and himself had some illness, according to
report. And after a little while we heard the
wailing of his mourners.”

<pb n="361"/>
@
“What is there surprising in that?” said
Antigonus: “I know a man who came to life more
than twenty days after his burial, having attended
the fellow both before his death and after he came
to life.’ “How was it,” said I, “that in twenty
days the body neither corrupted nor simply wasted
away from inanition? Unless it was an Epimenides1
whom you attended.”

@
While we were exchanging these words the sons
of Eucrates came in upon us from the palaestra, one
already of age, the other about fifteen years old, and
after greeting us sat down upon the couch beside
their father ; a chair was brought in forme. Then,
as if reminded by the sight of his sons, Eucrates
said: “As surely as I hope that these boys will be a
joy to me”—and he laid his hand upon them—
“what I am about to tell you, Tychiades, is true.
Everyone knows how I loved their mother, my wife
of blessed memory ; I made it plain by what I did
for her not only while she was alive but even when
she died, for I burned on the pyre with her all the
ornaments and the clothing that she liked while she
lived. On the seventh day after her death I was
lying here on the couch, just as I am now, consoling
my grief; for I was peacefully reading Plato’s book
about the soul. While I was thus engaged,
Demaenete herself in person came in upon me and
sat down beside me, just as Eucratides here is sitting
now”—with a gesture toward the younger of his
sons, who at once shuddered in a very boyish way ;
he had already been pale for some time over the
story. ‘“When I saw her,” Eucrates continued, “I

thereabouts.

<pb n="363"/>

caught her in my arms with a cry of grief and began
to weep. She would not permit me to cry, however,
but began to find fault with me because, although I
had given her everything else, I had not burned one
of her gilt sandals, which, she said, was under the
chest, where it had been thrown aside. That was
why we did not find it and burned only the one.
We were continuing our conversation when a cursed
toy dog that was under the couch, a Maltese, barked,
and she vanished at his barking. The sandal, however, was found under the chest and was burned
afterwards. 
@
“Is it right, Tychiades, to doubt these apparitions
any longer, when they are distinctly seen and a
matter of daily occurrence?” “No, by Heaven,”
I said: “those who doubt and are so disrespectful
toward truth deserve to be spanked like children,
with a gilt sandal!”
@
At this juncture Arignotus the Pythagorean came
in, the man with the long hair and the majestic
face—you know the one who is renowned for wisdom,
whom they call holy. As I caught sight of him, I
drew a breath of relief, thinking : “There now, a
broadaxe has come to hand to use against their
lies. The wise man will stop their mouths when
they tell such prodigious yarns.” I thought that
Fortune had trundled him in to me like a deus ex
machina, as the phrase is. But when Cleodemus
had made room for him and he was seated, he first
asked about the illness, and when Eucrates told him
‘that it was already less troublesome, said : “What
were you debating among yourselves? As I came

<pb n="365"/>

in, I overheard you, and it seemed to me that you
were on the point of giving a fine turn to the conversation !”</p>

<p>
“We are only trying to persuade this man of
adamant,” said Eucrates, pointing at me, “to believe
that spirits and phantoms exist, and that souls of
dead men go about above ground and appear to
whomsoever they will.” I flushed and lowered my ©
eyes out of reverence for Arignotus. ‘“Perhaps,
Eucrates,” he said, “Tychiades means that only the
ghosts of those who died by violence walk, for example, if a man hanged himself, or had his head cut
off, or was crucified, or departed life in some similar
way; and that those of men who died a natural
death do not. If that is what he means, we cannot
altogether reject what he says.” “No, by Heaven,”
replied Deinomachus, “he thinks that such things do
not exist at all and are not seen in bodily form.”

@30

“What is that you say?” said Arignotus, with a
sour look at me. “Do you think that none of
these things happen, although everybody, I may say,
sees them?’ “Plead in my defence,” said I,“if I
do not believe in them, that I am the only one of all
who does not see them; if I saw them, I should believe in them, of course, just as you do.” “Come,”
said he, “if ever you go to Corinth, ask where the
house of Eubatides is, and when it is pointed out to
you beside Cornel Grove, enter it and say to the doorman Tibius that you should like to see where the

<pb n="367"/>

Pythagorean Arignotus exhumed the spirit and
drove it away, making the house habitable from
that time on.
@
“What was that, Arignotus? asked Eucrates.
“It was uninhabitable,” he replied, “for a long time
because of terrors; whenever anyone took up his
abode in it, he fled in panic at once, chased out by a
fearful, terrifying phantom. So it was falling in and
the roof was tumbling down, and there was nobody
at all who had the courage to enter it.</p>

<p>
When I heard all this, I took my books—I have a
great number of Egyptian works about such matters—
and went into the house at bed-time, although my
host tried to'dissuade me and all but held me when
he learned where I was going—into misfortune with .
my eyes open, he thought. But taking a lamp I went
in alone; in the largest room I put down the light
and was reading peacefully, seated on the ground,
when the spirit appeared, thinking that he was
setting upon a man of the common sort and expecting to affright me as he had the others; he was
squalid and long-haired and blacker than the dark.
Standing over me, he made attempts upon me,
attacking me from all sides to see if he could get
the best of me anywhere, and turning now into a
dog, now into a bull or a lion. But I brought into
play my most frightful imprecation, speaking the’
Egyptian language, pent him up in a certain corner
of a dark room, and laid him. Then, having observed
where he went down, I slept for the rest of the
night.</p>

<p>
“In the morning, when everybody had given up
hope and expected to find me dead like the others,

<pb n="369"/>

I came forth to the surprise of all and went to
Eubatides with the good tidings that he could now
inhabit his house, which was purged and free from
terrors. So, taking him along and many of the
others too—they went wit us because the thing was
so amazing—I led them to the place where I had seen
that the spirit had gone down and told them to take
picks and shovels and dig. When they.did so, there
was found buried about six feet deep a mouldering
body of which only the bones lay together in order.
We exhumed and buried it; and the house from
that time ceased to be troubled by the phantoms.”
@
When Arignotus, a man of superhuman wisdom,
revered by all, told this story, there was no longer
any one of those present who did not hold me
convicted of gross folly if I doubted such things,
especially as the narrator was Arignotus. Nevertheless I did not blench either at his long hair or at
the reputation which encompassed him, but said: 
“What is this, Arignotus? Were you, Truth’s only
hope, just like the rest—full of moonshine and vain
imaginings? Indeed the saying has come true: our
pot of gold has turned out to be nothing but coals.”
</p>

<p>
“Come now,” said Arignotus, “if you put no trust
either in me or in Deinomachus or Cleodemus here
or in Eucrates himself, tell whom you consider more
trustworthy in such matters that maintains the opposite view to ours.” A very wonderful man,” said I,
“that Democritus who came from Abdera, who surely


<pb n="371"/>

was thoroughly convinced that nothing of this kind
can exist. He shut himself up in a tomb outside the
gates, and constantly wrote and composed there by
night and by day. Some of the young fellows, wishing to annoy and alarm him, dressed themselves up
like dead men in black robes and masks patterned
after skulls, encircled him and danced round and
round, in quick time, leaping into the air. Yet he
neither feared their travesty nor looked up at them at
all, but as he wrote said: ‘Stop your foolery!’ So
firmly did he believe that souls are nothing after
they have gone out of their bodies.”</p>

<p>
“That,” said Eucrates, “amounts to your saying
that Democritus, too, was a foolish man, if he really
thought so. 

@
But I will tell you another incident
derived from my own experience, not from hearsay. Perhaps even you, Tychiades, when you have
heard it, may be convinced of the truth of the
story.</p>

<p>
“When I was living in Egypt during my youth
(my father had sent me travelling for the purpose of
completing my education), I took it into my head to
sail up to Koptos and go from there to the statue of
Memnon in order to hear it sound that marvellous
salutation to the rising sun. Well, what I heard
from it was not a meaningless voice, as in the
general experience of common people ; Memnon
himself actually opened his mouth and delivered me
an oracle in seven verses, and if it were not too much
of a digression, I would have repeated the very
verses for you. 

@

But on the voyage up, there
chanced to be sailing with us a man from Memphis,
one of the scribes ot the temple, wonderfully

<pb n="373"/>

learned, familiar with all the culture of the
Egyptians. He was said to have lived underground
for twenty-three years in their sanctuaries, learning
magic from Isis.”</p>

<p>
“You mean Pancrates,” said Arignotus, “my
own teacher, a holy man, clean shaven, in white
linen, always deep in thought, speaking imperfect
Greek, tall, flat-nosed, with protruding lips and
thinnish legs.” ‘That self-'same Pancrates,’ he
replied: “and at first I did not know who he was,
but when I saw him working all sorts of wonders
whenever we anchored the boat, particularly riding
on crocodiles and swimming in company with the
beasts, while they fawned and wagged their tails, I
recognised that he was a holy man, and by degrees,
through my friendly behaviour, I became his
companion and associate, so that he shared all his
secret knowledge with me.</p>

<p>
“At last he persuaded me to leave all my servants
behind in Memphis and to go with him quite alone,
for we should not lack people to wait upon us; and
thereafter we got on in that way. 

@

But whenever we
came to a stopping-place, the man would take either
the bar of the door or the broom or even the pestle,
put clothes upon it, say a certain spell over it, and
make it walk, appearing to everyone else to be a man.
It would go off and draw water and buy provisions
and prepare meals and in every way deftly serve and
wait upon us. Then, when he was through with its

<pb n="375"/>

services, he would again make the broom a broom or
the pestle a pestle by saying another spell over it.</p>

<p>
“Though I was very keen to learn this from him,
I could not do so, for he was jealous, although most
ready to oblige in everything else. But one day I
secretly overheard the spell—it was just three
syllables—by taking my stand in a dark place. He
went off to the square after telling the pestle what it
had to do, 

@

and on the next day, while he was
transacting some business in the square, I took the
pestle, dressed it up in the same way, said the
syllables over it, and told it to carry water. When
it had filled and brought in the jar, I said, ‘Stop!
don’t carry any more water : be a pestle again!’ But
it would not obey me now: it kept straight on
carrying until it filled the house with water for us by
pouring it in! At my wit’s end over the thing, for
I feared that Pancrates might come back and be
angry, as was indeed the case, I took an axe and cut
the pestle in two ; but each part took a jar and began
to carry water, with the result that instead of one
servant I had now two. Meanwhile Pancrates
appeared on the scene, and comprehending what
had happened, turned them into wood again, just as
they were before the spell, and then for his own
part left me to my own devices without warning,
taking himself off out of sight somewhere.”</p>

<p>
“Then you still know how to turn the pestle into
a man?” said Deinomachus. “Yes,’ said he:
“only half way, however, for I cannot bring it back
to its original form if it once becomes a water-
375,
<pb n="377"/>

carrier, but we shall be obliged to let the house be
flooded with the water that is poured in!” 
@
“Will you never stop telling such buncombe, old
men as you are?” said I. “If you will not, at
least for the sake of these lads put your amazing
and fearful tales off to some other time, so that they
may not be filled up with terrors and strange
figments before we realise it. You ought to be easy
with them and not accustom them to hear things
like this which will abide with them and annoy them 
their lives long and will make them afraid of every
sound by filling them with all sorts of superstition.”
@
“Thank you,’ said Eucrates, “for putting me in
‘mind of superstition by mentioning it. What is
your opinion, Tychiades, about that sort of thing—
I mean oracles, prophecies, outcries of men under
divine possession, voices heard from inner shrines, or
verses uttered by a maiden who foretells the future?
Of course you doubt that sort of thing also? For
my own part, I say nothing of the fact that I have a
holy ring with an image of Apollo Pythius engraved
on the seal, and that this Apollo speaks to me:
you might think that I was bragging about myself
beyond belief. I should like, however, to tell you
all what I heard from Amphilochus in Mallus,1 when
the hero conversed with me in broad day and
advised me about my affairs, and what I myself saw,
and then in due order what I saw at Pergamon and .
what I heard at Patara.
1 A famous shrine in Cilicia. “After the death of his
father Amphiaraus and his disappearance at Thebes, he
(Amphilochus) was exiled from his own country and went to
Cilicia, where he fared quite well, for he, like his father,
foretold the future to the Cilicians and neceived two obols
for each oracle.” — Alexander 19.

<pb n="379"/>
</p>

<p>
“When I was on my way home from Egypt I
heard that this shrine in Mallus was very famous and
very trathful, and that it responded clearly, answering word for word whatever one wrote in his tablet
and turned over to the prophet. So I thought that it
would be well to give the oracle a trial in passing and
ask the god for some advice about the future—”

@
While Eucrates was still saying these words, since
I could see how the business would turn out and that
the cock-and-bull story about oracles upon which he
was embarking would not be short, I left him sailing
from Egypt to Mallus, not choosing to oppose everyone all alone: I was aware, too, that they were put
out at my being there to criticise their lies. “I am
going away,” I said, “to look up Leontichus, for I
want to speak to him about something. As for you,
since you do not think that human experiences afford
you a sufficient field, go ahead and call in the gods
themselves to help you out in your romancing.”
With that I went out. They were glad to have a
free hand, and continued, of course, to feast and to
gorge themselves with lies.</p>

<p>
There you have it, Philocles! After hearing all
that at the house of Eucrates I am going about like
a man who has drunk sweet must, with a swollen
belly, craving an emetic. I should be glad if I
could anywhere buy at a high price a dose of forgetfulness, so that the memory of what I heard may not
stay with me and work me some harm. In fact, I
think I see apparitions and spirits and Hecates!

<pb n="381"/>
@40
PHILOCLES
Your story has had the same enjoyable effect upon
me, Tychiades. They say, you know, that not only
those who are bitten by mad dogs go mad and fear
water, but if a man who has been bitten bites anyone
else, his bite has the same effect as the dog’s, and the
other man has the same fears. It is likely, therefore,
that having been bitten yourself by a multitude of
lies in the house of Eucrates, you have passed the bite
on to me; you have filled my soul so full of spirits !
TYCHIADES
Well, never mind; my dear fellow; we have a
powerful antidote to such poisons in truth and in
sound reason brought to bear everywhere. As long
as we make use of this, none of these empty, foolish
lies will disturb our peace.

Since the first edition, it has always been printed as the
twentieth of the Dialogues of the Gods, but in all the MSS.
it is a separate piece and has a separate caption of its own,
whereas in the Dialogues of the Gods the individual dialogues
are headed merely by the names of their interlocutors.
Then too it is longer than any of these, and although substantially of the same cloth, more markedly satirical than
most of them.</p>
<p>In connection with Lucian’s dialogue, it is well worth one’s

was influenced by the contemporary theatre.</p></note></head>

ZEUS
Hermes, take this apple; go to Phrygia, to Priam’s
son, the herdsman—he is grazing his flock in the
foothills of Ida, on Gargaron—and say to him:
“Paris, as you are handsome yourself, and also well
schooled in all that concerns love, Zeus bids you be
judge for the goddesses, to decide which of them is
the most beautiful. As the prize for the contest, let
the victor take the apple.” (To the Gopprsses) You
yourselves must now go and appear before your judge.
I refuse to be umpire because I love you all alike and
if it were possible, should be glad to see you all
victorious. Moreover, it is sure that if I gave the
guerdon of beauty to one, I should inevitably get into
the bad graces of the majority. For those reasons I
4am not a proper judge for you, but the young
Phrygian to whom you are going is of royal blood
and near of kin to our Ganymede; besides, he is
ingenuous and unsophisticated, and one cannot consider him unworthy of a spectacle such as this.

@
APHRODITE
For my part, Zeus, even if you should appoint
Momus himself to be our judge, I would go and face
the inspection confidently, for what could he carp at
inme? The others, too, ought to be satisfied with
the man. 

<pb n="387"/>

HERA
We are not afraid either, Aphrodite, not even if
the arbitration is turned over to your own Ares. We
accept this Paris, whoever he may be.
ZEUS
Is that your view too, daughter ? What do you
say? You turn away and blush? Of course, it is the
way of a maid like you to be bashful in such matters, 
but you nod assent anyhow. Go, then, and do not 
get angry at your judge, those of you who are
defeated, and do not inflict any harm on the lad. It
is not possible for all of you to be equally beautiful.

@
HERMES
Let us make straight for Phrygia; I will lead the
way, and you follow me without delaying. Be of
good courage; I know Paris. He is young and
handsome and in every way susceptible to love ; just
the sort to decide such questions. He would not
judge amiss, not he.
APHRODITE
What you say is all to the good and in my favour,
that our judge is just. Is he unmarried, or does
some woman live with him?
HERMES
Not quite unmarried, Aphrodite.
APHRODITE
What do you mean by that?
HERMES
Apparently someone is living with him, a woman
from Mount Ida, well enough, but countrified and
terribly unsophisticated ; however, he does not seem .
to think much of her.1 But why do you ask?
1 The reference is to Oenone.


<pb n="389"/>

APHRODITE
It was just a casual question.
@
ATHENA
I say, you are betraying your trust in talking to
her privately all this while.
HERMES
It was nothing alarming, Athena, or against you
and Hera; she asked me whether Paris is unmarried. ATHENA
Why was she inquisitive about that?
HERMES
I don’t know; she says, however, that she asked
because it came into her head casually, and not
because she had anything definite in view.
ATHENA
Well, what about it? Is he unmarried ?
HERMES
Apparently not.
ATHENA
Tell me, does he covet success in war and is he
fond of glory, or nothing but a herdsman ?.
HERMES
I can’t say for certain, but it is fair to suppose
that, being young, he yearns to acquire all that too,
and would like to be first in war.
APHRODITE
You see, I am not making any complaint or
reproaching you with talking confidentially to her ;
that is the way of fault-finders, not of Aphrodite !

<pb n="391"/>

HERMES
She herself asked me _ractically the same
questions ; so do not be ill-tempered or think you
are getting the worst of it if I answered her as I did
you, in a straightforward way. 

@

But in the course of
our conversation we have already left the stars far
behind as we pressed on, and we are almost over
Phrygia. Indeed I can see Ida and the whole of
Gargaron plainly, and unless I am mistaken, even
Paris himself, your judge.
HERA
Where is he? I do not see him.
HERMES
Look in this direction, Hera, to the left; not near
the mountain-top, but on the side, where the cavern is, near which you see the herd.
HERA
But I do not see the herd.
HERMES
What? Don’t you see tiny cattle over here in the
direction of my finger, coming out from among the
rocks, and someone running down from the cliff,
holding a crook and trying to prevent the herd from
scattering out ahead of him?
HERA
I see now—if that is really he.
HERMES
Yes, itis he. As we are near now, let us alight
upon the earth and walk, if it is your pleasure, so
that we may not alarm him by flying suddenly down
from above.

<pb n="393"/>

HERA
You are right: let us do so... Now that we
have descended, it is in order, Aphrodite, for you to
go in front and lead the way for us. You are probably
acquainted with the countryside, since by common
report you often came down to visit Anchises. 
APHRODITE
These jokes do not vex me greatly, Hera.
@
HERMES
No matter: I will lead you, for I myself spent
some time on Ida when Zeus was in love with his
Phrygian lad, and I often came here when he sent
me down to watch the boy. Indeed, when he was
in the eagle, I flew beside him and helped him to lift
the pretty fellow, and if my memory serves me, it —
was from this rock just here that Zeus caught him
up. You see, he chanced to be piping to his flock
then, and Zeus, flying down behind him, grasped
him very delicately in his talons, held in his beak
the pointed cap which was on the boy’s head, and
bore him on high, terrified and staring at him with
his head turned backwards. So then I took the
syrinx, for he had let it fall in his fright—but here
is your umpire close by, so let us speak to him.

@
 Good
day, herdsman.
PARIS
Good day to you also, young man. But who are
you, to have come here to see me, and who are these
women whom you have with you? They are not of a
sort to roam the mountains, being so beautiful.
(393
<pb n="395"/>

HERMES
They are not women; it is Hera and Athena and
Aphrodite whom you see, Paris, and I am Hermes,
sent by Zeus—but why do you tremble and turn
pale? Don't be afraid; it is nothing terrible. He
bids you be judge of thelr beauty, saying that as you
are handsome yourself and also well schooled in all
that concerns love, he turns over the decision to you.
You will find out the prize for the contest if you
read the writing on the apple.
PARIS
Come, let me see what it says; “The fairest
may have me.”—How could I, Lord Hermes, a mere
mortal and a countryman, be judge of an extraordinary spectacle, too sublime for a herdsman? To
decide such matters better befits dainty, city-bred
folk. As for me, I could perhaps pass judgement as
an expert between two she-goats, as to which is the
more beautiful, or between two heifers;

@

 but these
goddesses are all equally beautiful and I do not know
~ how a man could withdraw his eyes from one and
transfer them to another. They are not inclined to
come away readily, but wherever one directs them
first, they take firm hold and commend what is before
them; and if they pass over to something else, they
see that this too is beautiful and linger upon it,
mastered by what is near. In short, their beauty
encompasses and completely enthralls me, and I am
distressed that I cannot see with my whole body
as Argus did. I think I should pass a becoming
judgement if { should give the apple to them all.—
Another thing: one of them is Zeus’ sister and wife,

<pb n="397"/>

and the other two are his daughters! How, then,
could the decision help being hazardous from that
point of view also?
HERMES
I do not know; but it is impossible to escape
carrying out what Zeus has commanded.

@
PARIS
Do me this one favour, Hermes: persuade them
not to be angry with me, the two that are defeated,
but to think that only my sight is at fault.
HERMES
They say they will do so, and now it is high time
for you to get your judging done.
PARIS
I shall try; what else can one do? But first I
want to know whether it will satisfy the requirements
to look them over just as they are, or must I have
them undress for a thorough examination ?
HERMES
That is your affair, as you are the judge. Give
your orders as you will.
PARIS
As I will? I want to see them naked.
HERMES
Undress, goddesses. Make your inspection, Paris.
I have turned my back.

@
APHRODITE
Very well, Paris. I shall undress first, so that you
may discover that I am not just “white-armed”

<pb n="399"/>

and vain of “ox-eyes,” but that I am equally and
uniformly beautiful all over.1
ATHENA
Do not let her undress, Paris, until she puts aside
her girdle, for she is an enchantress; otherwise
she may bewitch you with it.2 And indeed she ought
not to appear before you made up to that extent and
bedaubed with all those colours, as if she were a
courtesan in earnest: she ought to show her beauty
unadorned.
PARIS
They are right about the girdle, so lay it aside.
APHRODITE
Then why do not you take off your helmet, Athena,
and show your head bare, instead of tossing your
plumes at the judge and frightening him? Are you
afraid that you may be criticized for the green glare
of your eyes if it is seen without trappings that inspire
terror ?3
ATHENA
There is the helmet for.you: I have taken it off.
APHRODITE
There is the girdle for you.
1 Aphrodite, vexed at Hera for twitting her about
Anchises, makes fun of her by implying that she has no other
beauties than those habitually commended in her by Homer.
2 See Iliad 14, 214 ff.
3 The word with which Homer describes the eyes of Athena
had an uncomplimentary sense in Lucian’s time. “Don’t let
it trouble you that her eyes are very green (πανύ γλαυκούς),
or that they squint and look at each other!” says a girl to
her lover about a rival (Dial. Mer. 2,1). And Hephaestus
finds Athena very beautiful, but must except her eyes: “To
be sure, she has green eyes, but the helmet makes even that
a mark of beauty” (Dial. Deor, 13 (vulg. 8)). So caesius in
Latin ; cf. Lucretius 4, 1161.

<pb n="401"/>

HERA
Come, let us undress.
@
PARIS
O Zeus, god of miracles! What a spectacle! What
beauty! What rapture! How fair the maiden is!
How royal and majestic and truly worthy of Zeus is
the matron’s splendour! How sweet and delicious
is the other’s gaze, and how seductively she smiled!
But I have more than enough of bliss already ; and if
you please, I should like to examine each of you
separately, for at present I am all at sea and do not
know what to look at; my eyes are ravished in every
direction. 
APHRODITE
Let us do that.
PARIS
Then you two go away, and you, Hera, stay here.
HERA
Very well, and when you have examined me
thoroughly, you must further consider whether the
rewards of a vote in my favour are also beautiful in
your eyes. If you judge me to be beautiful, Paris,
you shall be lord of all Asia.
PARIS
My decisions are not to be influenced by rewards.

@

But go; I shall do whatever seems best. Come,
Athena.
ATHENA
I am at your side, and if you judge me beautiful,
Paris, you shall never leave the-field of battle
4ol
<pb n="403"/>

defeated, but always victorious, for I shall make you
a warrior and a conqueror.
PARIS
I have no use, Athena, for war and battle. As you
see, peace reigns at present over Phrygia and Lydia,
and my father’s realm is free from wars. But have
no fear ; you shall not be treated unfairly, even if my
judgement is not to be influenced by gifts. Dress
yourself now, and put on your helmet, for I have seen
enough. It is time for Aphrodite to appear.

@
APHRODITE
Here I am close by; examine me thoroughly, part
by part, slighting none, but lingering upon each.
And if you will be so good, my handsome lad, let me
tell you this. I have long seen that you are young
and more handsome than perhaps anyone else whom
Phrygia nurtures. While I congratulate you upon
your beauty, I find’ fault with you because, instead
of abandoning these crags and cliffs and living in
town, you are letting your beauty go to waste in
the solitude. What joy can you get of the mountains? What good can your beauty do the kine?
Moreover, you ought to have married by this time—
not a country girl, however, a peasant, like the
women about Ida, but someone from Greece, either
from Argos or Corinth or a Spartan like Helen, who
is young and beautiful and not a bit inferior to me,
and above all, susceptible to love. If she but saw
you, I know very well that, abandoning everything
and surrendering without conditions, she would
follow you and make her home with you. No doubt
you yourself have heard something of her.


<pb n="405"/>

PARIS
Nothing, Aphrodite, but I should be glad to hear
you tell all about her now.

@
APHRODITE
In the first place, she is the daughter of that
lovely Leda to whom Zeus flew down in the form of
a swan.
PARIS
What is her appearance ?
APHRODITE
She is white, as is natural in the daughter of a
swan, and delicate, since she was nurtured in an eggshell, much given to exercise and athletics, and so
very much sought for that a war actually broke out
over her because Theseus carried her off while she was
still a young girl. Moreover, when she came to
maturity, all the noblest of the Achaeans assembled
to woo her, and Menelaus, of the line of Pelops, was
given the preferenee. If you like, I will arrange the
marriage for you.
PARIS
What do you mean? With a married woman?
APHRODITE
You are young and countrified, but I know how
such things are to be managed.
PARIS
How? I too want to know.

@
APHRODITE
You will go abroad on the pretext of seeing
Greece, and when you come to Sparta, Helen will
see you. From that time on it will be my look-out
that she falls in love with you and follows you.

<pb n="407"/>

PARIS
That is just the thing that seems downright
incredible to me, that she should be willing to
abandon her husband and sail away with a foreigner
and a stranger.
APHRODITE
Be easy on that score; I have two beautiful pages,
Desire and Love; these I shall give you to be your
guides on the journey. Love will enter wholly into
her heart and compel the woman to love you, while
Desire will encompass you and make you what he is
himself, desirable and charming. I myself shall be
there too, and I shall ask the Graces to go with me;
and in this way, by united effort, we shall prevail
upon her.
PARIS
How this affair will turn out is uncertain,
Aphrodite; but, anyhow, I am in love with Helen
already ; somehow or other I think I see her; I am
sailing direct to Greece, visiting Sparta, coming back
again with the woman—and it irks me not to be
doing all this now!

@
APHRODITE
Do not fall in love, Paris, until you have requited
me, your match-maker and maid of honour, with the
decision. It would be only fitting that when I am
there with you, I too should be triumphant, and that
we should celebrate at the same time your marriage
and my victory. It is in your power to buy everything—her love, her beauty, and her hand—at the
price of this apple.
PARIS
I am afraid you may dismiss me from your mind
after the decision.

<pb n="409"/>

APHRODITE
Do you want me to take an oath?
PARIS
Not at all; but promise once again.
APHRODITE
I do promise that I will give you Helen to wife,
and that she shall follow you and come to your ©
people in Troy ; and I myself will be there and help
in arranging it all.
PARIS
And shall you bring Love and Desire and the
Graces ?
APHRODITE
Have no fear; I shall take with me Longing and
Wedlock as well.
PARIS
Then on these conditions I award you the apple:
take it on these conditions.

<head>ON SALARIED POSTS IN GREAT HOUSES<note><p>A Hogarthian sketch of the life led by educated Greeks
who attached themselves to the households of great Roman
lords—and ladies. Lucian feigns to be advising a young
friend, whom he dubs Timocles (Master Ambitious), against
such a career—a most effective stratagem, sirice by giving
him a pretext for his criticism, it relieves him from all
semblance of personal animus and even enables him to appear
sympathetic toward the varlets while he dusts their jackets.</p>
<p>In after years, when Lucian went into the. Roman civil
service in Egypt, this essay rose up to haunt him, and he
had to write his Apology in order to lay its ghost.</p></note></head>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="1"><p>

"Where shall I make a beginning,” my friend,
“and where make an end of relating”1 all that must
be done and suffered by those who take salaried posts
and are put on trial in the friendship of our wealthy
men—if the name of friendship may be applied to
that sort of slavery on their part? Iam familiar with
much, I may say most, of their experiences, not
because I myself have ever tried anything of that kind,
for it never became a necessity for me to try it, and,
ye gods! I pray it never may ; but many of those who
have blundered into this existence have talked to me
freely, some, who were still in their misery, bewailing
the many bitter sufferings which they were then
undergoing, and others, who had broken jail, as it
were, recalling not without pleasure those they had
undergone ; in fact they joyed in recounting what
they had escaped from.</p>

<p>
These latter were the more trustworthy because
they had gone through all the degrees of the ritual, so
to speak, and had been initiated into everything from
beginning to end. So it was not without interest
and attention that I listened to them while they
spun yarns about their shipwreck and unlooked-for
deliverance, just like the men with shaven heads who
gather in crowds at the temples and tell of third
waves, tempests, headlands, strandings, masts carried
1 Cf. Odyssey 9, 14.

<pb n="415"/>

away, rudders broken, and to cap it all, how the T win
Brethren appeared (they are peculiar to this sort
of rhodomontade), or how some other deus ex machina
sat on the masthead or stood at the helm and
steered the ship to a soft beach where she might
break up gradually and slowly and they themselves
get ashore safely by the grace and favour of the god.
Those men, to be sure, invent the greater part of
their tragical histories to meet their temporary need,
in order that they may receive alms from a greater
number of people by seeming not only unfortunate
but dear to the gods;

@

 but when the others told of
household tempests and third waves—yes, by Zeus,
fifth and tenth waves, if one may say so—and how
they first sailed in, with the sea apparently calm, and
how many troubles they endured through the whole
voyage by reason of thirst or sea-sickness or inundations of brine, and finally how they stove their unlucky lugger on a submerged ledge or a sheer
pinnacle and swam ashore, poor fellows, in a wretched
plight, naked and in want of every necessity—in
these adventures and their account of them it seemed
to me that they concealed the greater part out of
shame, and voluntarily forgot it.
</p>

<p>
For my part I shall not hesitate to tell you everything, my dear Timocles, not only their stories but
whatever else I find by logical inference to be
characteristic of such household positions ; for I think
I detected long ago that you are entertaining designs

<pb n="417"/>
@
upon that life. I detected it first one time when our
conversation turned to that theme, and then someone
of the company praised this kind of wage-earning,
saying that men were thrice happy when, besides
having the noblest of the Romans for their friends,
eating expensive dinners without paying any scot,
living in a handsome establishment, and travelling in
all comfort and luxury, behind a span of white horses,
perhaps, with their noses in the air,1 they could also
get no inconsiderable amount of pay for the friendship
which they enjoyed and the kindly treatment which
they received ; really everything grew without sowing
and ploughing for such as they. When you heard all
that and more of the same nature, I saw how you
gaped at it and held your mouth very wide open for
the bait.</p>

<p>
In order, then, that as far as I am concerned I may
be free from blame in future and you may not be
able to say that when I saw you swallowing up that
great hook along with the bait I did not hold you
back or pull it away before it got into your throat or
give you forewarning, but waited until I saw you
dragged along by it and forcibly haled away when at
last it was pulled and had set itself firmly, and then,
when it was no use, stood and wept—in order that you
may not say this, which would be a very sound plea if
you should say it, and impossible for me to controvert
on the ground that I had done no wrong by not
warning you in advance—listen to everything at the
outset; examine the net itself and the impermeability of the pounds beforehand, from the outside at
1 That this is the meaning of éurriaCovres, and not “lolling
at ease,” is clear from Book-Collector 21 and Downward
Journey 16.

<pb n="419"/>

your leisure, not from the inside after you are in the
fyke ; take in your hands the bend of the hook and
the barb of its point, and the tines of the harpoon ;
puff out your cheek and try them on it, and if they
do not prove very keen and unescapable and painful
in one’s wounds, pulling hard and gripping irresistibly,
then write me down a coward who goes hungry for
that reason, and, exhorting yourself to be bold,
attack your prey if you will, swallowing the bait
whole like a gull!

@

The whole story will be told for your sake, no
doubt, in the main, but it will concern not only
students of philosophy like yourself, and those who
have chosen one of: the more strenuous vocations in
life, but also grammarians, rhetoricians, musicians, and
ina word all who think fit to enter families and serve
for hire as educators. Since the experiences of all
are for the most part common and similar, it is clear
that the treatment accorded the philosophers, so far
from being preferential, is more contumelious for
being the same, if it is thought that what is good
enough for the others is good enough for them, and
they are not handled with any greater respect by
their paymasters. Moreover, the blame for whatever the discussion itself brings out in its advance
ought to be given primarily to the men themselves
who do such things and secondarily to those who put
up with them. I am not to blame, unless there is
something censurable in truth and frankness.</p>

<p>
As to those who make up the rest of the mob, such
as athletic instructors and parasites, ignorant, pettyminded, naturally abject fellows, it is not worth while
to try to turn them away from such household positions, for they would not heed, nor indeed is it proper
to blame them for not leaving their paymasters,


<pb n="421"/>

however much they may be insulted by them, for
they are adapted to this kind of occupation and not
too good for it. Besides, they would not have anything else to which they might turn in order to keep
themselves busy, but if they should be deprived ot
this, they would be without a trade at once and out
of work and superfluous. So they themselves cannot
suffer any wrong nor their employers be thought
insulting for using a pot, as the saying goes, for a
pot’s use. They enter households in the first instance
to encounter this insolence, and it is their trade to
bear and tolerate it. But in the case of the educated
men whom I mentioned before, it is worth while to
be indignant and to put forth every effort to bring
them back and redeem them to freedom.
@5
It seems to me that I should do well to examine in
advance the motives for which some men go into
this sort of life and show that they are not at all
urgent or necessary. In that way their defence and
the primary object of their voluntary slavery would
be done away with in advance. Most of them plead
their poverty and their lack of necessities, and think
that in this way they have set up an adequate screen
for their desertion to this life. They consider that it
quite suffices them if they say that they act pardonably in seeking to escape poverty, the bitterest thing
in life. Then Theognis comes to hand, and time and
again we hear :
“All men held in subjection to Poverty,” 1
1 <cit>
<quote>
<l>ἄνδρ᾽ ἀγαθὸν πενίη πάντων δάμνησι μάλιστα,</l>
<l>καὶ γήρως πολιοῦ, Κύρνε, καὶ ἠπιάλου,</l>
<l>ἣν δὴ χρὴ φεύγοντα καὶ ἐς βαθυκήτεα πόντον</l>
<l>ῥιπτεῖν καὶ πετρέων, Κύρνε, κατ᾽ ἠλιβάτων.</l>

<bibl>Theognis 173 ff.</bibl>
</cit>

<pb n="423"/>

and all the other alarming statements about poverty
that the most spiritless of the poets have put forth.</p>

<p>
If I saw that they truly found any refuge from
poverty in such household positions, I should not
quibble with them in behalf of excessive liberty ; but
when they receive what resembles “the diet of invalids,” as our splendid orator once said,1 how can one
avoid thinking that even in this particular they are ill
advised, inasmuch as their condition in life always
remains the same? They are always poor, they must
continue to receive, there is nothing put by, no
surplus to save: on the contrary, what is given, even
if it is given, even if payment is received in full, is all
spent to the last copper and without satisfying their
need. It would have been better not to excogitate
any such measures, which keep poverty going by
simply giving first aid against it, but such as will do
away with it altogether—yes, and to that end perhaps
even .to plunge into the deep-bosomed sea if one
must, Theognis, and down precipitous cliffs, as you ~
say. But if a man who is always poor and needy
and on an allowance thinks that thereby he has
escaped poverty, I do not know how one can avoid
thinking that such a man deludes himself.
@
Others say that poverty in itself would not frighten
or cow them.if they could get their daily bread by
working like the rest, but as things are, since their
bodies have been debilitated by old age or by illnesses,
they have resorted to this form of wage-earning,
which is the easiest. Come, then, let us see if what
they say is true and they secure their gifts easily,
without working much, or any more than the rest.
It would indeed be a godsend to get money readily
1 Demosthenes 3, 33.

<pb n="425"/>

without toiling and moiling. As a matter of fact,
the thing cannot even be put into adequate words.
They toil and moil so much in their household positions that they need better health there and need
health more than anything else for that occupation,
since there are a thousand things every day that
fret the body and wear it down to the lowest depths
of despair. We shall speak of these at the proper
time, when we recount their other hardships. For —
the present it is enough to indicate that those
who allege this reason for selling themselves are not
telling the truth either.
@
One motive remains, which is exceedingly genuine
but not mentioned at all by them, namely, that they
plunge into these households for the sake of pleasure
and on account of their many extravagant expectations, dazzled by the wealth of gold and silver,
enraptured over the dinners and the other forms of
indulgence, and assured that they will immediately
drink gold in copious draughts, and that nobody
will stop their mouths. That is what seduces them
and makes them slaves instead of freemen—not
lack of necessaries, as they alleged, but desire for unnecessaries and envy of that abundance and luxury.
Therefore, like unsuccessful and unhappy lovers,
they fall into the hands of shrewd, experienced
minions who treat them superciliously, taking good
care that they shall always love them, but not permitting them ta enjoy the objects of their affection
even to the extent of a meagre kiss; for they know
that success will involve the dissolution of love. So
they hold that under lock and key and guard it
jealously, but otherwise they keep their lover always
hopeful, since they fear that despair may wean him

<pb n="427"/>

from his overmastering desire, and that he may grow
out of love for them. They smile upon him, then,
and make promises, and are always on the point of
being good to him, and generous, and lavish with
their attentions. Then before they know it, they
both are old, the one has passed the season for
loving, the other for yielding to love. Consequently 
they have done nothing in all their life except to
hope.
@
Now to put up with everything on account of
desire for pleasure is perhaps not altogether blameworthy, even excusable, if a man likes pleasure and
makes it his aim above all else to partake of it. Yet
perhaps it is shameful and ignoble for him to sell
himself on that account ; for the pleasure of freedom
is far sweeter. Nevertheless, let us grant that he
would be excusable in a measure, if he obtained it.
But to put up with many unpleasantnesses just on
account of the hope of pleasure is ridiculous in my
opinion and senseless, particularly when men see
that the discomforts are definite and patent in
advance and inevitable, while the pleasure that is
hoped for, whatever it is, has never yet come in all
the past, and what is more, is not even likely to
come in the future, if one should figure the matter
out on the basis of hard fact. The companions: of
Odysseus neglected all else because they were eating
the lotus and found it sweet, and they contemned
what was honourable because they contrasted it
with their immediate pleasure ; therefore it was not
entirely unreasonable of them to forget honour while
their souls dwelt upon that sweetness. But for a
man in hunger to stand beside another who eats his
fill of lotus without giving him any, and to be chained

<pb n="429"/>

to the spot, forgetful of all that is honourable and
right, by the mere hope that he himself may get a
taste some day—Heracles! how ridiculous and in
very truth deserving of a proper Homeric thrashing!1
@
Well, the motives which attract them to these
household positions, which cause them to put themselves eagerly into the power of the rich to treat as
they will, are these or as near as may be to these,
unless one should think it worth while to mention also
those men who are impelled by the mere name of
associating with men of noble family and high social
position. There are people who think that even
this confers distinction and exalts them above the
masses, just as in my own case, were it even the
Great King, merely to associate with him and to be
seen associating with him without getting any real
benefit out of the association would not be acceptable
to me.
@
So much for their object. Let us now consider
between ourselves what they put up with before
they are received and gain their end, and what they
endure when they are fairly in the thing, and to cap
the climax, what the outcome of the drama proves to
be. For surely it cannot be said that even if all this
is unworthy, at least it is easy to get and will not
call for much trouble; that you need only wish, and
then the whole thing is accomplished for you without
any effort. No, it calls for much running hither and
thither, and for continual camping on doorsteps ;
you must get up early and wait about ; meanwhile
you are elbowed, you are kept locked out, you are
sometimes thought impudent and annoying, you are
1 Like that bestowed upon Thersites by Odysseus (Iliad 2, 199, 265).

<pb n="431"/>

subordinate to a door-man with a vile Syrian accent
and to a Libyan master of ceremonies, and you tip
them for remembering your name. Moreover you
must provide yourself with clothing beyond the
means at your command, to correspond with the
dignity of the man whom you are cultivating, and
choose whatever colours he likes in order that you
may not be out of harmony or in discord when he
looks at you, and you must follow him zealously, or
rather, lead the way, shoved on by the servants and
filling out a guard of honour, as it were.</p>
<p>
But your man does not even look at you for many
days on end. And if ever you have a rare stroke of
luck—

@
if he sees you, calls you up and asks you a
casual question, then, ah! then you sweat profusely,
your head swims confusedly, you tremble inopportunely, and the company laughs at you for your
embarrassment. Many a time, when you should
reply to the question: “Who was the king of the
Achaeans,” you say, “They had a thousand ships!”
Good men call this modesty, forward men cowardice,
and unkind men lack of breeding. So, having found
the beginning of friendly relations very unstable
footing, you go away doomed by your own verdict
to great despair.</p>

<p>
When “many a sleepless night you have pillowed”
and have lived through “many a blood-stained day,”1
not for the sake of Helen or of Priam’s Trojan
citadel, but the five obols that you hope for, and
when you have secured the backing of a tragedy
god,2 there follows an examination to see if you are
learned in the arts. For the rich man that way of
1 Iliad 9, 325.
2 Some person, as opportune and powerful as a deus ex
machina, to press your suit.

<pb n="433"/>

passing time is not unpleasant, since he is praised
and felicitated, but you feel that you have then
before you the struggle for your life and for your
entire existence, for the thought of course steals into
your mind that no one else would receive you if you
were rejected by his predecessor and considered
unacceptable. So you cannot help being infinitely
distracted then; for you are jealous of your rivals
(let us suppose that there are others competing with
you for the same object); you think that everything you yourself have said has been inadequate,
you fear, you hope, you watch his face with straining
eyes; if he scouts anything you say, you are in distress, but if he smiles as he listens, you rejoice and
become hopeful. 

@12
No doubt there are many who side
against you and favour others in your stead, and
each of them stealthily shoots at you, so to speak,
from ambush. Then too imagine a man with a long
beard and grey hair undergoing examination to see
if he knows anything worth while, and some thinking that he does, others that he does not!</p>

<p>
Then a period intervenes, and your whole past life
is pried into. If a fellow-countryman. out of jealousy
or a neighbour offended for some insignificant reason
says, when questioned, that you are a follower of
women or boys, there they have it ! the witness speaks
by the book of Zeus; but if all with one accord
commend you, they are considered questionable,
dubious, and suborned. You must have great good
fortune, then, and no opposition at all; for that is
the only way in which you can win.</p>

<p>
Well, suppose you have been fortunate in everything beyond your fondest hopes. The master himself has commended your discussions, and those of


<pb n="435"/>

his friends whom he holds in the highest esteem
and trusts most implicitly in such matters have not
advised him against you. Besides, his wife is willing,
and neither his attorney nor his steward objects, nor
has anyone criticized your past; everything is
propitious and from every point of view the omens
are good. 

@
You have won, then, lucky man, and
have gained the Olympic crown—nay, you have
taken Babylon or stormed the citadel of Sardis ; you
shall have the horn of Plenty and fill your pails with
pigeon’s milk. It is indeed fitting that in return for
all your labours you should have the very greatest of
blessings, in order that your crown may not be mere
leaves ; that your salary should be set at a considerable figure and paid you when you need it, without
ado; that in other ways you should be honoured
beyond ordinary folk; that you should get respite
from your former exertions and muddiness and
running about and loss of sleep, and that in accordance
with your prayer you should “sleep with your legs
stretched out,” 1 doing only what you were engaged
for at the outset and what you are paid for. That
ought to be the way of it, Timocles, and there would
be no great harm in stooping and bearing the yoke
if it were light and comfortable and, best of all, gilded'
But the case is very different—yes, totally different.
There are thousands of things insupportable to a free
man that take place even after one has entered the
household. Consider for yourself, as you hear a list
of them, whether anyone could put up with them
who is even to the slightest degree cultured. 


@
I shall
begin, if you like, with the first dinner which will be
1 A proverbial expression for ‘“taking it easy.”


<pb n="437"/>

given you, no doubt, as a formal prelude to your
future intimacy.</p>

<p>
Very soon, then, someone calls, bringing an invitation to the dinner, a servant not unfamiliar with
the world, whom you must first propitiate by slipping
at least five drachmas into his hand casually so as not
to appear awkward. He puts on airs and murmurs:
“Tut, tut ! I take money from you?” ane : “Heracles!
I hope it may never come to that !"; but in the end
he is prevailed upon and goes away with a broad grin
at your expense. Providing yourself with clean
clothing and dressing yourself as neatly as you can,
you pay your visit to the bath and go, afraid of
getting there before the rest, for that would be
gauche, just as to come last would be ill-mannered. So
you wait until the middle moment of the right time,
and then go in. He receives you with much distinction, and someone takes you in charge and gives
you a place at table a little above the rich man, with
perhaps two of his old friends. 

@
As though you had
entered the mansion of Zeus, you admire everything
and are amazed at all that is done, for everything is
strange and unfamiliar to you. The servants stare
at you, and everybody in the company keeps an eye
on you to see what you are going to do. Even the
rich man himself is not without concern on this score ;
he has previously directed some of the servants to
watch whether you often gaze from afar at his sons
or his wife. The attendants of your fellow-guests,
seeing that you are impressed, crack jokes about
your unfamiliarity with what is doing and conjecture

<pb n="439"/>

that you have never before dined anywhere because
your napkin is new.1
As is natural, then, you inevitably break out in a
cold sweat for perplexity ; you do not dare to ask for
something to drink when you are thirsty for fear of
being thought a toper, and you do not know which
of the dishes that have been put before you in great
variety, made to be eaten in a definite order, you should
put out your hand to get first, or which second ; so you
will be obliged to cast stealthy glances at your neighbour, copy him, and find out the proper sequence of
the dinner. 

@

In general, you are in a chaotic state
and your soul is full of agitation, for you are lost in
amazement at everything that goes on. Now you
call Dives lucky for his gold and his ivory and all his
luxury, and now you pity yourself for imagining that
you are alive when you are really nothing at all.
Sometimes, too, it comes into your head that you are
going to lead an enviable life, since you will revel in
all that and share in it equally; you expect to enjoy
perpetual Bacchic revels. Perhaps, too, pretty boys
waiting upon you and faintly smiling at you paint the
picture of your future life in more attractive colours,
so that you are forever quoting that line of Homer:

happiness as this.
Then come the toasts, and, calling for a large bowl,

professor” or whatever it may be. You take the
bowl, but because of inexperience you do not know
that you should say something in reply, and you get
a bad name for boorishness.

Moreover, that toast
has made many of his old friends jealous of you,
some of whom you had previously offended when the
places at table were assigned because you, who had
only just come, were given precedence over men
who for years had drained the dregs of servitude.
So at once they begin to talk about you after this
fashion: “That was still left for us in addition to
our other afflictions, to play second fiddle to men
who have just come into the household, and it is only
these Greeks who have the freedom of the city of
Rome. And yet, why is it that they are preferred
to us? Isn't it true that they think they confer a
tremendous benefit by turning wretched phrases ?”’
Another says: “Why, didn’t you see how much he
drank, and how he gathered in what was set before
him and devoured it? The fellow has no manners,
and is starved to the limit; even in his dreams he
never had his fill of white bread, not to speak of
guinea fowl] or pheasants, of which he has hardly
left us the bones:”’ A third observes: “You silly
asses, in less than five days you will see him here
in the midst of us making these same complaints.
Just now, like a new pair of shoes, he is receiving acertain amount of consideration and attention, but
when he has been used again and again and is
smeared with mud, he will be thrown under the bed
in a wretched state, covered with vermin like the
rest of us.”</p>

Well, as I say, they go on about you indefinitely in

that vein, and perhaps even then some of them are
getting ready for a campaign of slander.

Anyhow,
that whole dinner-party is yours, and most of the
conversation is about you. For your own part, as you
have drunk more than enough subtle, insidious wine
because you ‘were not used to it, you have been
uneasy for a long time and are in a bad way: yet
it is not good form to leave early and not safe
to stay where you are. So, as the drinking is prolonged and subject after subject is discussed and
entertainment after entertainment is brought in (for
he wants to show you all his wealth !), you undergo
great punishment ; you cannot see what takes place,
and if this or that lad who is held in very great
esteem sings or plays, you cannot hear; you applaud
perforce while you pray that an earthquake may
tumble the whole establishment into a heap or that
a great fire may be reported, so that the party may
break up at last.

To spare you the tale of the flatulency that follows

one another about your stipend, how much you are to
receive and at what time of year. So with two or
three of his friends present, he summons you, bids
you to be seated, and opens the conversation: ‘ You
have already seen what our establishment is like, and
that there is not a bit of pomp and circumstance in
it, but everything is unostentatious, prosaic, and ordiriary. You must feel that we shall have everything in

with what is most important, my own soul or that of
my children”—suppose he has children who need
instruction—‘“and did not consider you equally free
to command everything else. But there should be
some stipulation. I recognise, to be sure, that you
are temperate and independent by nature, and am
aware that you did not join our household through
hope of pay but on account of the other things, the
friendliness that we shall show you and the esteem
which you will have from everyone. Nevertheless,
let there be some stipulation. Say yourself what you
wish, bearing in mind, my dear fellow, what we shall
probably give you on the annual feast-days. We
shall not forget such matters, either, even though we
do not now reckon them in, and there are many such
occasions in the year, as you know. So, if you take
all that into consideration, you will of course charge
us with a more moderate stipend. Besides, it would
well become you men of education to be superior to
money.”

@

By saying this and putting you all in a flutter
with expectations, he has made you submissive
to him. You formerly dreamed of thousands and
millions and whole farms and tenements, and you are
somewhat conscious of his meanness; nevertheless,
you welcome his promise with dog-like joy, and think
his “We shall have everything in common”’ reliable
and truthful, not knowing that this sort of thing

himself refuses to say, but tells one of the friends
who are present to intervene in the business and
name a sum that would be neither burdensome to
~ him, with many other expenses more urgent than this,
nor paltry to the recipient. The friend, a sprightly
old man, habituated to flattery from his boyhood,
says: ‘* You cannot say, sir, that you are not the
luckiest man in the whole city. In the first place
you have been accorded a privilege which many who
covet it greatly would hardly be able to obtain from
Fortune ; I mean in being honoured with his company, sharing his hospitality, and being received into
the first household in the Roman Empire. This is
better.than the talents of Croesus and the wealth of
Midas, if you know how to be temperate. Perceiving
that many distinguished men, even if they had to
pay for it, would like, simply for the name of the
thing, to associate with this gentleman and be seen
about* him in the guise of companions and friends, I
cannot sufficiently congratulate you on your good luck,
since you are actually to receive pay for such felicity.
I think, then, that unless you are very prodigal,
~ about so and so much is enough”—and he names
a very scanty sum, in striking contrast to those
expectations of yours.

You must be content, how-
“ever, for it would not even be possible for you to get
away, now that you are in the paddock. So you
take the bit with your eyes shut, and in the beginning you answer his touch readily, as he does not pull
hard or spur sharply until you have imperceptibly
grown quite used to him.</p>

<p>
People on the outside envy you after that, seeing
that you live within the pale and enter without let
and have become a notable figure in the inner circle.

You yourself do not yet see why you seem to them
to be fortunate. Nevertheless, you are joyous and
delude yourself, and are always thinking that the
future will turn out better. But the reverse of what
you expected comes about: as the proverb has it,
the thing goes Mandrobulus-wise,1 diminishing every
day, almost, and dropping back.

Slowly and
gradually, therefore, as if you could then distinguish
things for the first time in the indistinct light, you
begin to realize that those golden hopes were
nothing but gilded bubbles, while your labours are
burdensome and genuine, inexorable and continuous.
“What are they?” perhaps you will ask me: “J.
do not see what there is in such posts that is
laborious, nor can I imagine what those wearisome
and insupportable things are that you spoke of.” 2
Listen, then, my worthy friend, and do not simply
try to find out whether there is any weariness im the
thing, but give its baseness and humility and general
slavishness more than incidental consideration in the
hearing.

@
First of all, remember never again from that time
forward to think yourself free or noble. All that—
your pride of race, your freedom, your ancient
lineage—you will leave outside the threshold, let
me tell you, when you go in after having sold yourself into such service; for Freedom will refuse to
enter with you when you go in for purposes so base
and humble. So you will be a slave perforce,
however distasteful you may find the name, and not
the slave of one man but of many; and you will

shameful hire.” 1 Since you were not brought up in
the company of Slavery from your boyhood but
made her acquaintance late and are getting your
schooling from her at an advanced age, you will not

The memory of your freedom, stealing over you,
plays the mischief with you, sometimes causing you
to be skittish, and for that reason to come off badly

<p>
Perhaps, however, you think it quite enough to
establish your freedom that you are not the son of a
Pyrrhias or a Zopyrion, and that you have not been
sold in the market like a Bithynian by a loud-voiced
auctioneer. But, my excellent friend, when the first
of the month arrives and side by side with Pyrrhias
and Zopyrion you stretch out your hand like the rest
of the servants and take your earnings, whatever
they are—that is sale! There was no need of an
auctioneer in the case of a man who put himself up
at auction and for a long time solicited a master.

Ah, scurvy outcast (that would be my language,

laid hands upon you and were haling you off,
saying that you were a slave, would you not invoke
the law and make a great stir and be wrathful and
shout ‘“Heavens and Earth!” at the top of your
voice? Then just for a few obols, at that age when,

you gone and sold yourself, virtue and wisdom
included ? Had you no respect, either, for all those
wonderful sermons that your noble Plato and
Chrysippus and Aristotle have preached in praise
of freedom and in censure of servility? Are you
not ashamed to undergo comparison with flatterers
and loafers and buffoons; to be the only person
in all that Roman throng who wears the incongruous cloak of a scholar and talks Latin with a
villainous accent; to take part, moreover, in uproarious dinners, packed with human flotsam that
is mostly vile? At these dinners you are vulgar
in your compliments, and you drink more than is
discreet. Then in the morning, roused by a bell,
you shake off the sweetest of your sleep and run
about town with the pack, up hill and down dale,
with yesterday's mud still on your legs. Were
you so in want of lupines and herbs of the field,
did even the springs of cold water fail you so completely, as to bring you to this pass out of desperation ?
No, clearly it was because you did not want water
and lupines, but cates and meat and wine with a
bouquet that you were caught, hooked like a pike
in the very part that hankered for all this—in the
gullet—and it served you quite right! You are
confronting, therefore, the rewards of this greediness,
and with your neck in a collar like a monkey you are
a laughing-stock to others, but seem to yourself to
be living in luxury because you can eat figs without
stint. Liberty and noblesse, with all their kith and
kin, have disappeared completely, and not even a
memory of them abides.
@
Indeed, it would be lucky for you if the thing

<pb n="455"/>

involved only the shame of figuring as a slave
_ instead of a free man, and the labour was not like
that of an out-and-out servant. But see if what is
required of you is any more moderate than what is
required of a Dromo ora Tibius! To be sure, the
purpose for which he engaged you, saying that he
wanted knowledge, matters little to him; for,
as the proverb says, “What has a jackass to do
with a lyre?” Ah, yes, can’t you see? they
are mightily consumed .with longing for the
wisdom of Homer or the eloquence of Demosthenes
or the sublimity of Plato, when, if their gold and
’ their silver and their worries about them should be
taken out of their souls, all that remains is pride
and softness and self-indulgence and sensuality and
insolence and ill-breeding! Truly, he does not want
you for that purpose at all, but as you have a long
beard, present a distinguished appearance, are neatly
dressed in a Greek mantle, and everybody knows
you for a grammarian or a rhetorician or a philosopher, it seems to him the proper thing to have a
man of that sort among those who go before him
and form his escort; it will make people think
him a devoted student of Greek learning and in
general a person of taste in literary matters So the
chances are, my worthy friend, that instead of your
marvellous lectures it is your beard and mantle that
you have let for hire.

You must therefore be seen with him always and
never be missing; you must get up early to let
yourself be noted in attendance, and you must not

showing those who meet him that even when he
takes a walk he is not inattentive to the Muses but
makes good use of his leisure during the stroll.

For
your own part, poor fellow, now you run at his side,
and now you forge about at a foot’s pace, over many
ups and downs (the city is like that, you know),
until you are sweaty and out of breath, and then,
while he is indoors talking to a friend whom he
came to see, as you have no place to sit down, you
stand up, and for lack of employment read the
book with which you armed yourself.</p>

<p>
When night overtakes you hungry and thirsty, after
a wretched bath you go to your dinner at an unseasonable hour, in the very middle of the night; but you
are no longer held in the same esteem and admiration
by the company. If anyone arrives who is more of a
novelty, for you it is “Get back!” In this way
you are pushed off into the most unregarded corner
and take your place merely to witness the dishes
that are passed, gnawing the bones like a dog if
they get as far as you, or regaling yourself with
gratification, thanks to your hunger, on the tough
mallow leaves with which the other food is garnished,
if they should be disdained by those nearer the head
of the table.</p>

Moreover, you are not spared other forms of rudeness. You are the only one that does not have an egg.
There is no necessity that you should always expect
the same treatment as foreigners and strangers:
that would be unreasonable! Your bird, too, is
not like the others; your neighbour's is fat and
plump, and yours is half a tiny chick, or a tough
pigeon—out-and-out rudeness and contumely! Often,
if there is a shortage when another guest appears of

a sudden, the waiter takes up what you have before
you and quickly puts it before him, muttering:
“You are one of us, you know.” Of course when a
side of pork or venison is cut at table, you must by
all means have especial favour with the carver or
else get a Prometheus-portion, bones hidden in fat.
That the platter should stop beside the man above
you until he gets tired of stuffing himself, but speed
past you so rapidly—what free man could endure it
if he had even as much resentment as a deer? And
I have not yet mentioned the fact that while the
others drink the most delectable and oldest of wines,
you alone drink one that is vile and thick, taking good
care always to drink out of a gold or silver cup so
that the colour may not convict you of being such
an unhonoured guest. If only you might have your
fill, even of that! But as things are, though you ask
for it repeatedly, the page “hath not even the
semblance of hearing”!1
@
You are annoyed, indeed, by many things, a great
many, almost everything; most of all when your
favour is rivalled by a cinaedus or a dancing-master
or an Alexandrian dwarf who recites Ionics.2, How
could you be on a par, though, with those who
render these services to passion and carry notes
about in their clothing ? So, couched in a far corner
of the dining-room and shrinking out of sight for
shame, you groan, naturally, and commiserate yourself and carp at Fortune for not besprinkling you
with at least a few drops of the amenities. You
would be glad, I think, to become a composer of
1 Iliad 23, 430.
2 Anacreontics, Sotadeans, and in general, the “erotic
ditties” mentioned below.

erotic ditties, or at all events to be able to sing
them properly when somebody else had composed
them : for you see where precedence and favour go!
You would put up with it if you had to act the part
of a magician or a soothsayer, one of those fellows
who promise legacies amounting to many thousands,
governorships, and tremendous riches ; you see that
they too get on well in their friendships and are
highly valued. So you would be glad to adopt one
of those réles in order not to be entirely despicable
and useless; but even in them, worse luck, you are
not convincing. Therefore you must needs be
humble and suffer in silence, with stifled groans and
amid neglect. 

@
If a whispering servant accuse you of being the
only one who did not praise the mistress’s page when
he danced or played, there is no little risk in the
thing. So you must raise your thirsty voice like a
stranded frog, taking pains to be conspicuous among
the claque and to lead the chorus; and often when
the others are silent you must independently let
drop a well-considered word of praise that will convey
great flattery.</p>

That a man who is famished, yes, and athirst,
should be perfumed with myrrh and have a wreath
on his head is really rather laughable, for then you
are like the gravestone of an ancient corpse that is

stones with myrrh and crown them with wreaths,
and then they themselves enjoy the food and drink
that has been prepared !

If the master is of a jealous disposition and has
handsome sons or a young wife, and you are not
wholly estranged from Aphrodite and the Graces,

your situation is not peaceful or your danger to be
taken lightly. The king has many ears and eyes,
which not only see the truth but always add something more for good measure, so that they may not
be considered heavy-lidded. You must therefore
keep your head down while you are at table, as at a
Persian dinner, for fear that an eunuch may see
that you looked at one of the concubines ; for another
eunuch, who has had his bow bent this long time, is
ready to punish you for eyeing what you should not,
driving his arrow through your. cheek just as you are
taking a drink. 

@.
Then, after you have left the dinner-party, you
get a little bit of sleep, but towards cock-crow you
wake up and say: “Oh, how miserable and wretched
Iam! To think what I left—the occupations of
former days, the comrades, the easy life, the sleep
limited only by my inclination, and the strolls in
freedom—and what a pit I have impetuously flung
myself into! Why, in heaven’s name? What does
this splendid salary amount to? Was there no other
way in which I could have earned more than this
and could have kept my freedom and full independence? As the case stands now, I am pulled about
like a lion leashed with a thread, as the saying is, up
hill and down dale; and the most pitiful part of it
all is that I do not know how to be a success and
cannot be a favourite. I am an outsider in such
matters and have not the knack of it, especially
when I am put in comparison with men who have
‘made an art of the business. Consequently I am
unentertaining and not a bit convivial; I cannot
even raise a laugh. I am aware, too, that it often
actually annoys him to look at me, above all when he

<pb n="465"/>

wishes to be merrier than his wont, for Iseem to him
gloomy. I cannot suit him at all. If I keep to
gravity, I seem disagreeable and almost a person to
run away from ; and if I smile and make my features
as pleasant as I can, he despises me outright and
abominates me. The thing makes no better impression than as if one were to play a comedy in a
tragic mask! All in all, what other life shall I live
for myself, poor fool, after having lived this one for
another?”
@
While you are still debating these matters the
bell rings, and you must follow the same routine, go
the rounds and stand up; but first you must rub
your loins and knees with ointment if you wish to
last the struggle out! Then comes a similar dinner,
prolonged to the same hour. In your case the diet
is in contrast to your former way of living; the
sleeplessness, too, and the sweating and the weariness
gradually undermine you, giving rise to consumption,
pneumonia, indigestion, or that noble complaint, the
gout. You stick it out, however, and often you
ought to be abed, but this is not permitted. They
think illness a pretext, and a way of shirking your
duties. The general consequences are that you are
always pale and look as if you were going to die any
minute.
@
So it goes in the city. And if you have to go into the
country, I say nothing of anything else, but it often
rains; you are the last to get there—even in the
matter of horses it was your luck to draw that kind !—
and you wait about until for lack of accommodation
they crowd you in with the cook or the mistress’s
hairdresser without giving you even a generous
supply of litter for a bed !

@
I make no bones of telling you a story that I was
told by our friend Thesmopolis, the Stoic, of something that happened to him which was very comical,
and it is not beyond the bounds of possibility that
the same thing may happen to someone else. He
was in the household of a rich and self-indulgent
woman who belonged to a distinguished family in
the city. Having to go into the country one time,
in the first place he underwent, he said, this highly
ridiculous experience, that he, a philosopher, was
given a favourite to sit by, one of those fellows who
have their legs depilated and their beards shaved off ;
the mistress held him in high honour, no doubt. He
gave the fellow’s name; it was Dovey!1_ Now what
a thing that was, to begin with, for a stern‘old man
with a grey beard (you know what a long, venerable
beard Thesmopolis used to have) to sit beside a
fellow with rouged cheeks, underlined eyelids, an
unsteady glance, and a skinny neck—no dove, by
Zeus, but a plucked vulture! Indeed, had it not
been for repeated entreaties, he would have worn a
hair-net on his head. In other ways too Thesmopolis
suffered numerous annoyances from him all the way,
for he hummed and whistled and no doubt would
even have danced in the carriage if Thesmopolis had
not held him in check.
@
Then too, something else of a similar nature was
required of him. The woman sent for him and said:
“Thesmopolis, I am asking a great favour of you;
1 Chelidonion : Little Swallow.


<pb n="469"/>

please do it for me without making any objections or
waiting to be asked repeatedly.” He promised, as
was natural, that he would do anything, and she
went on: “I ask this of you because I see that you
are kind and thoughtful and sympathetic—take my
dog Myrrhina (you know her) into your carriage and
look after her for me, taking care that she does not
want for anything. The poor thing is unwell and is
almost ready to have puppies, and these abominable,
disobedient servants do not pay much attention even
to me on journeys, let alone to her. So do not think
that you will be rendering me a trivial service if you
take good care of my precious, sweet doggie.”
Thesmopolis promised, for she plied him with many
entreaties and almost wept. The situation was as
funny as could be: a little dog peeping out of his
cloak just below his beard, wetting him often, even
if Thesmopolis did not add that detail, barking in a
squeaky voice (that is the way with Maltese dogs,
you know), and licking the philosopher’s beard,
especially if any suggestion of yesterday's gravy was
in it! The favourite ‘who had sat by him was joking
rather wittily one day at the expense of the company
in the dining-room, and when in due course his
banter reached Thesmopolis, he remarked: “As to
Thesmopolis,- I can only say that our Stoic has
finally gone to. the dogs!”1 I was told, too, that
the doggie actually had her puppies in the cloak of
Thesmopolis.

dinner in a style that was not by any means uncultivated, but very finished and studied. He was

took this venture on, it was said, for two hundred

All this is not so bad, perhaps. But if Divesf
himself has a turn for writing poetry or prose and
recites his own compositions at dinner, then you
must certainly split yourself applauding and flattering
him and excogitating new styles of praise. Some
of them wish to be admired for their beauty also,
and they must hear themselves called an Adonis
or a Hyacinthus, although sometimes they have
a yard of nose. If you withhold your praise, off you
go at once to the quarries of Dionysius because
you are jealous and are plotting against your master.
They must be philosophers and rhetoricians, too,
and if they happen to commit a solecism, precisely
on that account their language must seem full of
the flavour of Attica and of Hymettus, and it must
be the law to speak that way in future.

After all, one could perhaps put up with the conduct of the men. But the women—! That is another

make speeches. In consenting to deliver a selection from

things still worse by allowing the company to time his
speech with a substitute for a water-clock which they improvised out of a flask of wine.

and following their litters. They count it as one
among their other embellishments if it is said that
they are cultured and have an interest in philosophy
and write songs not much inferior to Sappho’s. To
that end, forsooth, they too trail hired rhetoricians and
grammarians and philosophers about, and listen to
their lectures—when ? it is ludicrous !—either while
their toilet is being made and their hair dressed, or
at dinner ; at other times they are too busy! And
often while the philosopher is delivering a discourse
the maid comes up and hands her a note from her
lover, so that the lecture on chastity is kept waiting
until she has written a reply to the lover and hurries
back to hear it.

At last, after a long lapse of time, when the feast
of Cronus1 or the Panathenaic festival comes, you are
sent a beggarly scarf or a flimsy undergarment. Then
by all means there must be a long and impressive
procession. The first man, who has overheard his
master still discussing the matter, immediately runs
and tells you in advance, and goes away with a
generous fee for his announcement, paid in advance.
In the morning a baker’s dozen of them come
bringing it, and each one tells you: “I talked about
it a great deal!” “I jogged his memory!” “It was
left to me, and I chose the finest one!’ So all
of them depart with a tip, and even grumble that
you did not give more.
@
As to your pay itself, it is a matter of two obols,
or four, at a time, and when you ask for it you are
a bore and a nuisance. So, in order to get it you

must flatter and wheedle the master and pay court to
his steward too, but in another way; and you must
not neglect his friend and adviser, either. As what
you get is already owing to a clothier or doctor or
shoemaker, his gifts are no gifts and profit you
nothing.1
@
You are greatly envied, however, and perhaps some
slanderous story or other gradually gets afoot by
stealth and comes to a man who by now is glad to
receive charges against you, for he sees that you are
used up by your unbroken exertions and pay lame
and exhausted court to him, and that the gout is
growing upon you. To sum it up, after garnering all
that was most profitable in you, after consuming the
most fruitful years of your life and the greatest
vigour of your body, after reducing you to a thing of
_ rags and tatters, he is looking about for a rubbish-heap
on which to cast you aside unceremoniously, and for
another man to engage who can stand the work.
Under the charge that you once made overtures to a
page of his, or that, in spite of your age, you are trying
to seduce an innocent girl, his wife's maid, or something
else of that sort, you leave at night, hiding your face,
bundled out neck and crop, destitute of everything
and at the end of your tether, taking with you, in
addition to the burden of your years, that excellent
companion, gout. What you formerly knew you have
forgotten in all these years, and you have made your
belly bigger than a sack, an insatiable, inexorable
curse. Your gullet, too, demands what it is used to,
and dislikes to unlearn its lessons.

Nobody else would take you in, now that you have
passed your prime and are like an old horse whose
hide, even, is not as serviceable as it was. Besides,
the scandal of your dismissal, exaggerated by conjecture, makes people think you an adulterer or
poisoner or something of the kind. Your accuser is
trustworthy even when he holds his tongue, while
you are a Greek, and easy-going in your ways and
prone to all sorts of wrong-doing. That is what they
think of us all, very naturally. For I believe I have
detected the reason for that opinion which they have
of us. Many who have entered households, to make
up for not knowing anything else that was useful,
have professed to supply predictions, philtres, lovecharms, and incantations against enemies ; yet they
assert they are educated, wrap themselves in the
philosopher’s mantle, and wear beards that cannot
lightly be sneered at. Naturally, therefore, they
entertain the same suspicion about all of us on seeing
that men whom they considered excellent are that
sort, and above all observing their obsequiousness at
dinners and in their other social relations, and their
servile attitude toward gain.

@
Having shaken them off, they hate them, very
naturally, and endeavour in every way to destroy
them outright if possible; for they expect them to
betray the many hidden mysteries of their make-up, inasmuch as they are thoroughly acquainted with everything and have looked upon them unveiled. That
sticks in their throat, because they are all exactly like

the finest of papyrus rolls, of which the knobs are of
gold and the slip-cover of purple, but the content is
either Thyestes feasting on his children or Oedipus
married to his mother, or Tereus debauching two
sisters at once. They too are splendid and
universally admired, but inside, underneath their
purple, they hide a deal of tragedy ; in fact if you
unroll any one of them, you will find an ample drama
by an Euripides or a Sophocles, while on the outside
there is a gaudy purple laticlave and a golden bulla.
Conscious of all this, they hate and plot against any
renegade who, having become thoroughly familiar
with them, is likely to expose the plot and tell it
broadcast.

I desire, nevertheless, in imitation of Cebes,1 to
paint you a picture of this career that we have
discussed, so that you may look at it and determine.
whether you should enter it. I should gladly have
requisitioned an Apelles, or Parrhasius, or Aetion, or
Euphranor to paint it, but since it is impossible
nowadays to find anyone so excellent and so
thoroughly master of his craft, I shall show you the
picture as best I can in unembellished prose.</p>

Imagine painted a lofty, golden gateway, not down
on the level ground but above the earth on a hill ;
the slope is long and steep and slippery, so that many
a time those who hoped soon to be at the summit have
‘broken their necks by a slip of the foot. Within,
let Wealth himself be sitting, all golden, seemingly,
very beautiful and fascinating ; and let his lover,
afler ascending with great toil, draw near the door
and gaze spellbound at the gold. Let Hope, herself

tair of face and gaily dressed, take him in charge and
conduct him within, tremendously impressed by his
entrance. Then let Hope keep always in advance
of him, and let other women, Deceit and Servitude,
receive him successively and pass him on to Toil, who,
after breaking the wretch with hard labour, shall at
length deliver him, now sickly and faded, to Old
Age. Last of all, let Insolence lay hold of him and
drag him along to Despair; let Hope then fly away
and vanish, and instead of the golden portal by
which he entered, let him be ejected by some
remote and secret postern, naked, paunchy, pale, and
old, screening his nakedness with his left hand and
throttling himself with his right; and on the way
out, let him be met by Repentance, weeping to no
avail and helping to make an end of the poor man.</p>

“Let that be the conclusion of the painting. The
rest, my dear Timocles, is up to you; examine all the
details with care and make up your mind whether it
suits you to enter the pictured career by these doors
and be thrown out so disgracefully by that one
opposite. Whatever you do, remember the words of
the philosopher: “God is not at fault; the fault is
his who maketh the choice.”<ref n="1"/>
