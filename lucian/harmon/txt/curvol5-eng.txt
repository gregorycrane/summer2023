This piece is wanting in N and several other MSS. because
it was in the Index Librorum Prohibitorum. It has been
edited separately by Lionello Levi, with the readings of
eight MSS., chief of which are I’, X (Pal. 73), and M (Par.
954).
1 The greeting here employed (its sense might perhaps be
more adequately rendered by ‘‘ Good issues to all your
doings”’) marks Cronius as a Platonist. Lucian himself
(Lapsus, 4) ascribes its origin to Plato, and he employs it in
addressing the philosopher Nigrinus (I, p. 98). A Platonist
named Cronius is more than once mentioned by Porphyry,
but to identify the two would contribute next to nothing to
our knowledge of either.
2 Cf. Aulus Gellius, XII, 11: philosophum nomine Pere-
grinum, cui postea cognomentum Proteus factum est, virum
gravem et constantem, etc. Lucian calls him Peregrinus
Proteus in Demonaz, 21 (I, p. 156), but simply Proteus the
Cynic in adv. Indoct., 14 (III, p. 192), and he is Proteus to

<head>THE PASSING OF PEREGRINUS<note><p>An account of the life and death of a Cynic philosopher
who for a time in his early life went over to Christianity,
practising it to the point of imprisonment under a very
tolerant administration, and after returning to Cynicism
became in his old age so enamoured of Indic ideas and pre-
cedents that he cremated himself at Olympia, just after the
games of .D. 165, even as Calanus had done at Susa in the
presence of Alexander the Great and as Zarmarus had done
at Athens, after initiation into the mysteries, in the presence
of Augustus.</p>
<p>Writing soon after the event, of which he was a witness,
Lucian makes his main theme the story of what went on at
Olympia. The earlier life of Peregrinus is portrayed incident-
ally in a speech attributed by Lucian to someone whose name
he aa not know, but clearly made by Lucian himself (p. 8,
n. 2).</p>
<p>Lucian believes himself to be exposing a sham, whose
zeal was not at all for truth but only for applause and renown.
Many notable modern critics, including Zeller, Bernays,
Croiset, and Wilamowitz, dissent from his interpretation,
discerning in the man an earnest seeker after truth; for to
them thirst for glory is not an adequate explanation of his
final act. This point of view hardly embodies sufficient
recognition of the driving force of that motive with Greeks,
and particularly Greeks of the second century (Nock, Con-
verston, p. 201). Greek writers recognised it as a possible
explanation of the behaviour of Calanus and of Zarmarus.
In this case, Lucian not only knew the man but knew others
who knew him: for instance, Demonax. Assuredly, the
interpretation that he gives is not his alone. Perhaps it is
not so far wrong after all. Certainly there are authentic
features in it, like the attempt of Proteus to get back the
inheritance he had previously renounced and bestowed upon
his native city, which make it impossible to see in him the
earnest and steadfast man” that Aulus Gellius thought him.</p></note></head>

Best wishes from Lucian to Cronius.1
Unlucky Peregrinus, or, as he delighted to style
himself, Proteus,? has done exactly what Proteus
in Homer did.® After turning into everything for
the sake of notoriety and achieving any number of
transformations, here at last he has turned into fire;
so great, it seems, was the love of notoriety that
eae be him. And now your genial friend has got
imself carbonified after the fashion of Empedocles,
except that the latter at least tried to escape
the Philostrati (cf. Vit. Soph. II, 1, 33 and for the elder
Philostratus the title of his lost work Proteus the Cynic ; or,
the Sophist), to Tatian (Orat. ad Graecos, 25), and to Athena-
goras (Legat. de Christian., 26). The name Peregrinus is
used in Aulus Gellius, VIII, 3, Ammianus Marcellinus, X XIX,
1, 39, Tertullian ad Martyres, 4, and Eusebius, Chron., Vol. II,
p. 170, Schéne. From the passage in Gellius cited above we
can infer only that he did not hear the sobriquet Proteus when
he was in Athens. The manner of its employment by Lucian
is sufficient evidence that it did not originate with Lucian,
or after the death of Peregrinus. It was probably applied
to him towards the close of his career. That it bears a sense
very like what Lucian attributes to it is clear from Maximus
of Tyre, VIII, 1. In § 27 Lucian professes to have heard that
he wanted to change it to Phoenix after his decision to immolate
himself. -
3 The transformations of the sea-god in his effort to escape
from Menelaus, who wanted to consult him, are told in the
Odyssey, IV, 454-459.

while this gentleman waited for that one of the
Greek festivals which draws the greatest crowds,
heaped up a very large pyre, and leaped into it
before all those witnesses; he even addressed the
Greeks on the subject not many days before his
venture.
I think I can see you laughing heartily at the old
man’s drivelling idiocy—indeed, I hear you give
tongue as you naturally would: ‘‘ Oh, the stupidity !
Oh, the vainglory! Oh ”’—everything else that we
are in the habit of saying about it all. Well, you
are doing this at a distance and with far greater
security, but I said it right by the fire and even
earlier in a great crowd of listeners, angering some
of them—as many as admired the old man’s
fool-hardiness; but there were others beside myself
who laughed at him. However, I narrowly missed
getting torn limb from limb for you by the Cynics
just as Actaeon was by his dogs or his cousin Pentheus
by the Maenads.
The complete mise en scéne of the affair was as
follows. You know, of course, what the playwright
was like and what spectacular performances he
presented his whole life long, outdoing Sophocles
and Aeschylus. As for my part in it, as soon as I
came to Elis, in going up? by way of the gymnasium
I overheard a Cynic bawling out the usual street-
corner invocations to Virtue in a loud, harsh voice,
and abusing everyone without exception. Then

1 The cases of Dionysus and Asclepius were not quite
parallel. Zeus could not have Asclepius raising the dead,
and so transferred his activities to a higher sphere by means
of the thunderbolt. It was Semele, the mother of Dionysus,
whom his other bolt carbonised; but as it certainly effected,
even if only incidentally, the translation of Dionysus, and as
one of the epigrams in the Anthology (XVI, 185) similarly
links Dionysus with Heracles as having achieved immortality
by fire, it is hard to see why so many editors have pruned

<note type="head">THE PASSING OF PEREGRINUS</head>
of my ability I shall try to quote for you the very
words he said. You will find the style familiar, of
course, as you have often stood near them while
they were ranting.
“Does anyone dare,”’ he said, ‘to call Proteus
vainglorious, O Earth, O sun, O rivers, O sea, O
Heracles, god of our fathers!—Proteus, who was
imprisoned in Syria, who renounced five thousand
talents in favour of his native land, who was banished
from the city of Rome, who is more conspicuous
than the sun, who is able to rival Olympian Zeus
himself? Because he has resolved to depart from
life by way of fire, are there people who attribute
this to vainglory? Why, did not Heracles do so?
Did not Asclepius and Dionysus,) by grace of the
thunderbolt? Did not Empedocles end by leaping
into the crater?”
When Theagenes 2—for that was the bawler’s ,
name—said that, I asked a bystander, “‘ What is the
meaning of his talk about fire, and what have Heracles
and Empedocles to do with Proteus?” “ Before
long,’’ he replied, “ Proteus is going to burn himself
up at the Olympic festival.” ‘‘ How,” said I, ‘“ and
why?’’ Then he undertook to tell me, but the
Cynic was bawling, so that it was impossible to hear
anyone else. I listened, therefore, while he flooded
the exuberance of Theagenes by excising mention of Dionysus
from his remarks. Cf. Parl. of the Gods, 6 (p. 425).
2 We learn elsewhere in this piece that Theagenes lived
in Patras and had property worth fifteen talents, obtained
by lending money. Bernays (Lucian und die Kyniker, pp.
13-18) is very likely right in thinking this to be the man
whose death in Rome is described by Galen (Meth. Med., 13,
15: X, 909 Kiihn), but he makes rather too much of tha
passage as an endorsement of Theagenes. ;

us with the rest of his bilge-water and got off a
lot of amazing hyperbole about Proteus, for, not
deigning to compare him with the man of Sinope,!
or his teacher Antisthenes, or even with Socrates
himself, he summoned Zeus to the lists. Then,
however, he decided to keep them about equal, and
thus concluded his speech: ‘‘ These are the two
noblest masterpieces that the world has seen—the
Olympian Zeus, and Proteus; of the one, the creator
and artist was Phidias, of the other, Nature. But
now this holy image is about to depart from among
men to gods, borne on the wings of fire, leaving us
bereft.” After completing this discourse with
copious perspiration, he shed tears in a highly
ridiculous way and tore his hair, taking care not to
pull very hard; and at length he was led away,
sobbing as he went, by some of the Cynics, who
strove to comfort him.
After him, another man went up at once,? not per-
mitting the throng to disperse, but pouring a libation
on the previous sacrificial offerings while they were
still ablaze. At first he laughed a long time, and
obviously did it from the heart. Then he began
somewhat after this fashion: ‘‘ Since that accursed
Theagenes terminated his pestilential remarks with
the tears of Heraclitus, I, on the contrary, shall
begin with the laughter of Democritus.” And
again he went on laughing a long time, so that he
or personality of the author of these remarks, puts it beyond
doubt that the “other man” is Lucian himself, and that he
expects his readers to draw this inference. The device is so
transparent that its intent can be regarded only as artistic.
It is employed also in The Hunuch, 10 (p. 341). Somewhat
similar is his borrowing a Prologue from Menander to speak
for him in The Mistaken Critic (p. 379).

drew most of us into doing likewise. Then, changing
countenance, he said, “‘ Pray, what else, gentlemen,
are we to do when we hear utterances so ridiculous,
and see old men all but standing on their heads in
public for the sake of a little despicable notoriety?
That you may know what manner of thing is this
‘holy image’ which is about to be burned up, give
me your ears, for I have observed his character
and kept an eye on his career from the beginning,
and have ascertained various particulars from his
fellow-citizens and people who cannot have helped
knowing him thoroughly.
“This creation and masterpiece of nature, this
Polyclitan canon,} as soon as he came of age, was
taken in adultery in Armenia and got a sound
thrashing, but finally jumped down from the roof
and made his escape, with a radish stopping his
vent. Then he corrupted a handsome boy, and by
paying three thousand drachmas to the boy’s parents,
who were poor, bought himself off from being brought
before the governor of the province of Asia.
“ All this and the like of it I propose to pass over ;
for he was still unshapen clay, and our ‘holy
image’ had not yet been consummated for us.
What he did to his father, however, is very well
worth hearing; but you all know it—you have
heard how he strangled the aged man, unable to
tolerate his living beyond sixty years. Then,
when the affair had been noised abroad, he con-
demned himself to exile and roamed about, going
to one country after another.

“It was then that he learned the wondrous lore
of the Christians, by associating with their priests
and scribes in Palestine. And—how else could it
be P—in a trice he made them all look like children ;
for he was prophet, cult-leader, head of the syna-
gogue, and everything, all by himself. He inter-
preted and explained some of their books and even
composed many, and they revered him as a god, made
use of him as a lawgiver, and set him down as a
protector, next after that other, to be sure, whom 1
they still worship, the man who was crucified in
Palestine because he introduced this new cult into
the world.
“Then at length Proteus was apprehended for this
and thrown into prison, which itself gave him no
little reputation as an asset for his future career and
the charlatanism and notoriety-seeking that he was
enamoured of. Well, when he had been imprisoned,
the Christians, regarding the incident as a calamity,
left nothing undone in the effort to rescue him.
Then, as this was impossible, every other form of
attention was shown him, not in any casual way but
with assiduity ; and from the very break of day aged
widows and orphan children could be seen waiting
near the prison, while their officials even slept inside
with him after bribing the guards. Then elaborate
meals were brought in, and sacred books of theirs
were read aloud, and excellent Peregrinus—for he
still went by that name—was called by them ‘ the
new Socrates.’
1 The sense of the unemended text here is ‘ protector ;
that great man, to be sure, they still worship,” etc.

“ Indeed, people came even from the cities in Asia,
sent by the Christians at their common expense,
to succour and defend and encourage the hero. They
show incredible speed whenever any such public
action is taken; for in no time they lavish their all.
So it was then in the case of Peregrinus; much money
came to him from them by reason of his imprison-
ment, and he procured not a little revenue from it.
The poor wretches have convinced themselves,
first and foremost, that they are going to be immortal
and live for all time, in consequence of which they
despise death and even willingly give themselves
into custody, most of them. Furthermore, their
first lawgiver! persuaded them that they are all
brothers of one another after they have transgressed
once for all by denying the Greek gods and by
worshipping that crucified sophist himself and living
under his laws. Therefore they despise all things
indiscriminately and consider them common property,
receiving such doctrines traditionally without any
definite evidence. So if any charlatan and trickster,
able to profit by occasions, comes among them, he
quickly acquires sudden wealth by imposing upon
simple folk.
“ However, Peregrinus was freed by the then
governor of Syria, a man who was fond of philo-
sophy.2. Aware of his recklessness and that he
1 From the wording of this sentence the allusion is so
obviously to Christ himself that one is at a loss to under-
stand why Paul, let alone Moses, should have been suggested.
For the doctrine of brotherly love cf. Matt. 23, 8: adpres dé
dpets ddcAdoi eore.
2 The Roman governor of the province of Syria is meant.
Identification is impossible because the date of the imprison-
ment of Peregrinus cannot be fixed.

would gladly die in order that he might leave behind
him a reputation for it, he freed him, not consider-
ing him worthy even of the usual chastisement.!
Upon returning to his home, he found that the matter
of his father’s murder was still at fever heat and that
there were many who were for pressing the charge
against him. Most of his possessions had been
carried off during his absence, and only his farms
remained, amounting to fifteen talents; for the
entire property which the old man left had been
worth perhaps thirty talents, not five thousand as
that utterly ridiculous Theagenes asserted. Even the
entire city of Parium,? taking along with it the five
that are its neighbours, would not fetch that much,
including the men, the cattle, and all the rest of
their belongings.
“* However, the charge and complaint was still
aglow, and it was probable that before long somebody
would appear against him; above all, the people
themselves were enraged, mourning over a good old
man (as he was called by those who had seen him) so
impiously slain. But observe what a plan our clever
Proteus discovered to cope with all this, and how he
escaped the danger. Coming before the assembly
of the Parians—he wore his hair long by now, dressed
in a dirty mantle, had a wallet slung at his side, the
staff was in his hand, and in general he was very
histrionic in his get-up—manifesting himself to
them in this guise, he said that he relinquished to the

2 In Acts 15, 29 the apostles and the elder brethren pre-
scribe abstaining “from sacrifices offered to idols, and from
blood, and from things strangled’? (eidoAd8ura kat alya Kat
amucrd). Probably what Lucian has in mind is pagan sacri-
ficial meats. This may be just a guess, from the way he
puts it; but if so, it is highly plausible on account of the

state all the property which had been left him by his
father of blessed memory. When the people, poor
folk agape for largesses,1 heard that, they lifted their
voices forthwith: ‘The one and only philosopher!
The one and only patriot! The one and only rival
of Diogenes and Crates!’ His enemies were
muzzled, and anyone who tried to mention the murder
was at once pelted with stones.
“* He left home, then, for the second time, to roam
about, possessing an ample source of funds in the
Christians, through whose ministrations he lived in
unalloyed prosperity. For a time he battened him-
self thus; but then, after he had transgressed in some
way even against them—he was seen, I think,
eating some of the food that is forbidden them 2—
they no longer accepted him, and so, being at a loss,
he thought he must sing a palinode and demand his
possessions back from his city. Submitting a peti-
tion, he expected to recover them by order of the
Emperor. Then, as the city sent representatives to
oppose the claim, he achieved nothing, but was
directed to abide by what he had once for all deter-
mined, under no compulsion from anyone.
“ Thereafter he went away a third time, to Egypt,
to visit Agathobulus,’ where he took that wonderful
course of training in asceticism, shaving one half of
his head, daubing his face with mud, and demon-
strating what they call‘ indifference’ by erecting his
notorious indifference of the Cynics towards what they ate.
Peregrinus may have signalised his relapse to Cynicism by
sampling a “‘ dinner of Hecate’’ at the cross-roads.
3 Demonaz, 3, Lucian alludes to Agathobulus as one of
those with whom Demonax had studied. The teacher of
Peregrinus was therefore reputable as well as famous.

giving and taking blows on the back-sides with a
stalk of fennel, and playing the mountebank even
more audaciously in many other ways.
“ From there, thus equipped, he set sail for Italy
and immediately after disembarking he fell to abusing
everyone, and in particular the Emperor,? knowing
him to be mild and gentle, so that he was safe in
making bold. The Emperor, as one would expect,
cared little for his libels and did not think fit to punish
for mere words a man who only used philosophy as a
cloak, and above all, a man who had made a pro-
fession of abusiveness. But in our friend’s case, even
from this his reputation grew, among simple folk any-
how, and he was a cynosure for his recklessness, until
finally the city prefect, a wise man, packed him off for
immoderate indulgence in the thing, saying that the
city had no need of any such philosopher. However,
this too made for his renown, and he was on every-
body’s lips as the philosopher who had been banished
for his frankness and excessive freedom, so that in this
respect he approached Musonius, Dio, Epictetus, and
anyone else who has been in a similar predicament.
“Coming at last to Greece under these circum-
stances, at one moment he abused the Eleans, at
another he counselled the Greeks to take up arms
against the Romans,’ and at another he libelled a man
outstanding in literary attainments and position
because he had been a benefactor to Greece in many

ways, and particularly because he had brought water
to Olympia and prevented the visitors to the festival
from dying of thirst, maintaining that he was making
the Greeks effeminate, for the spectators of the
Olympic games ought to endure their thirst—yes,
by Heaven, and even to lose their lives, no doubt,
many of them, through the frequent distempers
which formerly ran riot in the vast crowd on account
of the dryness of the place!1_ And he said this while
he drank that same water!
When they almost killed him with stones, mobbing
him with one accord, he managed to escape death at
the moment by fleeing to Zeus for sanctuary (stout
fellow !), and afterwards, at the next Olympiad, he
gave the Greeks a speech which he had composed
during the four years that had intervened, praising
the man who had brought in the water and defending
himself for running away at that time.
“ At last he was disregarded by all and no longer
so admired; for all his stuff was stale and he could
not turn out any further novelty with which to
surprise those who came in his way and make them
marvel and stare at him—a thing for which he had a
fierce craving from the first. So he devised this
ultimate venture of the pyre, and spread a report
among the Greeks immediately after the last
Olympic games that he would burn himself up at the
next festival. And now, they say, he is playing the
mountebank over that very thing, digging a pit,
1 The man was the famous Herodes Atticus. For the
aqueduct built by him at Olympia see Frazer’s Pausanias,
Vol. IV, pp. 72 ff. Philostratus (Vit. Soph. II, 1, 33) records
that Herodes was often berated by Proteus, to whom on one
occasion he hinted that it might at least be done in Greek.

1 Thanks to Paul Graindor, the date of the Olympiads
mentioned in connection with Peregrinus can now be deter-
mined. He has deduced from the apparent ages of the children
represented in the exedra erected ty Herodes on the com-
lotion of his aqueduct that this took place in a.p. 153
Prrérode Atticus et Sa Famille, pp. 87-88). His deduction
finds support in the text of Lucian as soon as we recognise
that Lucian is talking about four different Olympiads, not
three. The first is that on which Peregrinus criticised the
aqueduct, which will be the year of its completion, a.p. 153.
At the nezt (riv fis, A.D. 157) he withdrew his criticism.
The Olympiad just after which he announced his intention
of cremating himself need not and cannot be identical with

collecting logs, and promising really awesome forti-
tude.t
“* What he should have done, I think, was first and
foremost to await death and not to cut and run from
life ; but if he had determined to be off at all costs, not
to use fire or any of these devices out of tragedy, but
to choose for his departure some other form of death
out of the myriads that there are. If, however, he is
partial to fire as something connected with Heracles,.
why in the world did he not quietly select a well-
wooded mountain and cremate himself upon it in
solitude, taking along only one person such as
Theagenes here for his Philoctetes?2 On the con-
trary, it is in Olympia, at the height of the festival,
all but in the theatre, that he plans to roast himself—
not undeservedly, by Heracles, if it is right for
parricides and for atheists to suffer for their hardi-
nesses. And from that point of view he seems to be
getting about it very late in the day; he ought long
ago to have been flung into the bull of Phalaris * to
pay the fitting penalty instead of opening his mouth
to the flames once for all and expiring in a trice. For
the one of a.D. 157; it is called by the speaker the last, or
previous (riv éumpocber), and the text clearly implies a lapse
of time. It must therefore be the one of a.p. 161. Then
comes the fourth, on which the cremation took place, dated
by Eusebius in a.p. 165.
2 Philoctetes had helped Heracles to cremate himself on
Mt. Oeta by kindling the pyre for him.
® As the cremation actually took place at Harpina, two
miles away from Olympia, and on the day after the festival
closed, it may be that religious scruples (cf. § 26) caused
Peregrinus to modify an original plan which involved its
taking place at Olympia itself while the festival was in
progress.
“See Phalaris I, 11-12 (Vol. I, pp. 17 ff.).

people tell me that no other form of death is quicker

“The spectacle is being planned, I suppose, as
Something awe-inspiring—a fellow getting burnt up
in a holy place where it is impious even to bury the
others who die. But you have heard, no doubt, that
long ago a man who wished to become famous burned
the temple of Ephesian Artemis, not being able to
attain that end in any other way.!_ He himself has
something similar in mind, so great is the craving for
fame that has penetrated him to the core.
“ He alleges, however, that he is doing it for the
sake of his fellow men, that he may teach them to
despise death and endure what is fearsome. For my
part, I should like to ask, not him but you, whether
you would wish malefactors to become his disciples
in this fortitude of his, and to despise death and
burning and similar terrors. No, you would not, I
am very sure. How, then, is Proteus to draw dis-
tinctions in this matter, and to benefit the good
without making the bad more adventurous and
daring?
“Nevertheless, suppose it possible that only those
will present themselves at this affair who will see it
to their advantage. Once more I shall question you:
would you desire your children to become imitators of
such a man? You will not say so. But why did I
ask that question, when even of his disciples them-
which very likely was accompanied by a curse, was far from
ineffective, for nearly all ancient authors who mention the
story, including Cicero and Plutarch, omit the name just as
Lucian does,

selves not one would imitate him? In fact, the thing
for which one might blame Theagenes most of all is
that although he copies the man in everything else,
he does not follow his teacher and take the road
with him, now that he is off, as he says, to join
Heracles; why, he has the opportunity to attain
absolute felicity instanter by plunging headlong into
the fire with him!
“Emulation is not a matter of wallet, staff, and
mantle; all this is safe and easy and within anyone’s
power. One should emulate the consummation and
culmination, build a pyre of fig-wood logs as green as
can be, and stifle one’s selfin the smoke of them. Fire
itself belongs not only to Heracles and Asclepius,
but to doers of sacrilege and murder, who can be
seen enduring it by judicial sentence. Therefore it
is better to employ smoke, which would be peculiar
and belong only to you and your like.
“ Besides, if Heracles really did venture any such
act, he did it because he was ailing, because the blood
of the Centaur, as the tragedies tell us, was preying
upon him; but for what reason does this man throw
himself bodily into the fire? Oh, yes! to demon-
strate his fortitude, like the Brahmans, for Theagenes
thought fit to compare him with them, just as if
there could not be fools and notoriety-seekers even
among the Indians. Well, then, let him at least
imitate them. They do not leap into the fire (so
Onesicritus says, Alexander’s navigator, who saw
Calanus burning), but when they have built their
pyre, they stand close beside it motionless and en-

cremate themselves decorously, without the slightest
alteration of the position in which they are lying.
“In this man’s case, what great thing will it be if
he tumbles in and dies in the sudden grip of the fire?
It is not beyond expectation that he will jump out
half consumed, unless, as they say, he is going to see
to it that the pyre is deep down in a pit. There are
people who say that he has even changed his mind,
and is telling certain dreams, to the effect that
Zeus does not permit pollution of a holy place.1 But
let him be assured on that score; I would take my
oath to it that no one of the gods would be angry if
Peregrinus should die a rogue’s death. Moreover, it
is not easy for him to withdraw now; for his Cynic
associates are urging him on and pushing him into
the fire and inflaming his resolution; they will not
let him shirk it. If he should pull a couple of them
into the fire along with him when he jumps in, that
would be the only nice thing about his performance.
“ Thave heard that he no longer deigns to be called
Proteus but has changed his name to Phoenix,
because the phoenix, the Indian bird, is said to mount
a pyre when it is very far advanced in age. Indeed,
he even manufactures myths and repeats certain
oracles, ancient, of course, to the purport that he
is to become a guardian spirit of the night; it is
plain, too, that he already covets altars and expects
to be imaged in gold.

“ By Zeus, it would be nothing unnatural if, among
all the dolts that there are, some should be found to
assert that they were relieved of quartan fevers by
him, and that in the dark they had encountered the
guardian spirit of the night! Then too these accursed
disciples of his will make an oracular shrine, I suppose,
with a holy of holies, at the site of the pyre, because
the famous Proteus, son of Zeus, the progenitor of
his name, was given to soothsaying.1 I pledge m
word, too, that priests of his will be appointed, wit
whips or branding-irons or some such flummy-diddle,
or even that a nocturnal mystery will be got up in his
honour, including a torch festival at the site of the

ms Theagenes, as I have been told by one of my

prediction about all this; in fact, he quoted the

But when the time shall come that Proteus, noblest
of Cynics,
Kindleth fire in the precinct of Zeus, our Lord of
the Thunder,
Leapeth into the flame, and cometh to lofty
Olympus,
Then do I bid all alike who eat the fruit of the
ploughland 5
Honour to pay unto him that walketh abroad in the
night-time,
Greatest of spirits, thronéd with Heracles and
Hephaestus.

the Sibyl. But I will quote him one of the oracles of

1 Lucian gives the Cynic a Roland for his Oliver. Bacis
was a title rather than a name, and in early Greece prophets
who bore it were little less numerous than the Sibyls.
Naturally it was a convenient tag for a spurious oracle,
whether composed with fraudulent intention or, as often in
Aristophanes, for fun.
2 Below (§ 33), Proteus speaks of being “ commingled with
the ether.”

Bacis dealing with these matters.1_ Bacis expresses
himself as follows, with a very excellent moral :
Nay, when the time shall come that a Cynic with
names that are many
Leaps into roaring flame, soul-stirred by a passion
for glory,
Then it is meet that the others, the jackals that
follow his footsteps,
Mimic the latter end of the wolf that has taken
departure.
But if a dastard among them shall shun the might
of Hephaestus,
Let him be pelted with stones forthwith by all the
Achaeans,
Learning, the frigid fool, to abjure all fiery
speeches,
He that has laden his wallet with gold by the
taking of usance ;
Thrice five talents he owns in the lovely city of
Patras.
What do you think, gentlemen? That Bacis is a
worse soothsayer than the Sibyl? It is high time,
then, for these wondrous followers of Proteus to
look about for a place in which to aerify themselves
—for that is the name they give to cremation.” 2
When he had said these words, all the bystanders
shouted: “ Let them be burned right now; they
deserve the flames!” And the man got down again
laughing; but “Nestor failed not to mark the
din: 3 I mean Theagenes. When he heard the
shouting he came at once, took the platform, and fell to

ranting and telling countless malicious tales about the
man who had just got down—I do not know what
that excellent gentleman’s name was. For my part,
I left him splitting his lungs and went off to see the
athletes, as the Hellanodicae were said to be already
in the Plethrium.!
Well, there you have what happened at Elis; and
when we reached Olympia, the rear chamber ? was
full of people criticising Proteus of praising his
purpose, so that most of them even came to blows.
Finally, Proteus himself appeared, escorted by a
countless multitude, after the contest of the heralds,
and had somewhat to say about himself, telling of the
life that he had led and the risks that he had run,
and of all the troubles that he had endured for
philosophy’s sake. His speech was protracted, though
I heard but little on account of the number of
bystanders. Afterwards, fearing to be crushed in
such a throng, because I saw this happening to
many, I went away, bidding a long farewell to the
sophist enamoured of death who was pronouncing his
own funeral oration before his demise.
This much, however, I overheard; he said that he
wanted to put a tip of gold on a golden bow; for
one who had lived as Heracles should die like Heracles
and be commingled with the ether. ‘‘ And I wish,”
said he, “ to benefit mankind by showing them the
1 According to Pausanias (VI, 23, 2), a place in the Gym-
nasium of Elis where the officials of the games (Hellanodicae)
determined by lot the matching of the athletes.
2 Of the temple of Zeus; as it was open at the end, it
formed a sort of portico. Cf. Runaways, 7; Herodotus, 1.
3 Pandarus the Trojan (Iliad, IV, 111) put a tip of gold on
the bow he had fashioned of horn. The golden bow (fie) of
Peregrinus is his life (Biw).

way in which one should despise death; wherefore
all men ought to play Philoctetes to me.” The
more witless among the people began to shed tears
and call out: “‘ Preserve your life for the Greeks! ”
but the more virile part bawled “ Carry out your
purpose!” by which the old man was immoderately
upset, because he hoped that all would cling to him
and not give him over to the fire, but retain him in
life—against his will, naturally! That ‘‘ Carry out
your purpose” assailing him quite unexpectedly
caused him to turn still paler, although his colour was
already deathly, and even to tremble slightly, so
that he brought his speech to an end.
You can imagine, I expect, how I laughed; for it
was not fitting to pity a man so desperately in love
with glory beyond all others who are driven by the
same Fury. Anyhow, he was being escorted by
crowds and getting his fill of glory as he gazed at the
number of his admirers, not knowing, poor wretch,
that men on their way to the cross or in the grip of the
executioner have many more at their heels.
Soon the Olympic games were ended, the most
splendid Olympics that I have seen, though it was
then the fourth time that I had been a spectator.
As it was not easy to secure a carriage, since many were
leaving at the same time, I lingered on against my
will, and Peregrinus kept making postponements, but
at last had announced a night on which he would
stage his cremation; so, as one of my friends had
invited me to go along, I arose at midnight and took
the road to Harpina, where the pyre was. This is
quite twenty furlongs from Olympia as one goes past

p. 200) thus explains the mystic allusion to the South: “ It

the hippodrome towards the east. As soon as we
arrived, we found a pyre built in a pit about six feet
deep. It was composed mostly of torchwood, and
the interstices filled with brush, that it might take
fire quickly. When the moon was rising—for she
too had to witness this glorious deed—he came
forward, dressed in his usual fashion, and with him
the leaders of the Cynics; in particular, the gentle-
man from Patras, with a torch—no bad understudy.
Proteus too was bearing a torch. Men, approaching
from this side and that, kindled the fire into a very
great flame, since it came from torchwood and brush.
Peregrinus—and give me your close attention now !—
laying aside the wallet, the cloak, and that notable
Heracles-club, stood there in a shirt that was downright
filthy. Then he requested incense to throw on the
fire; when someone had proffered it, he threw it on,
and gazing towards the south—even the south, too,
had to do with the show 1—he said: “ Spirits of my
mother and my father, receive me with favour.”
With that he leaped into the fire; he was not visible,
however, but was encompassed by the flames, which
had risen to a great height.
Once more I see you laughing, Cronius, my
the south, the region of the Manes. See Atharvaveda 18, 3,
13; 4, 40, 2. So the monthly offerings (¢raddhas) to the
Manes are performed in such a way that they end in the
south (Manu’s Laws, 3,214). The invoking of the daipoves
is in accord with Hindu thought; eg. the liturge in Hiran-
yakegin’s Grhya-siitra, 2, 10° (see F. Max Miiller’s Sacred
Books of the Kast, XXX, p. 226), after inviting the Manes,
sprinkles water towards the south, saying: ‘ Divine waters,
send us Agni.’ The vexpdyyedor and veprepodpéuor in 41 may
be an echo of Yama’s messengers that has reached Lucian.
See Atharvaveda 18, 2, 27 and H. C. Warren’s Buddhism in
Translations, pp. 225-262.”

Cynics stood about the pyre, not weeping, to be sure,
but silently evincing a certain. amount of grief as
they gazed into the fire, until my gorge rose at them,
and I said: ‘‘ Let us go away, you simpletons. It is
not an agreeable spectacle to look at an old man who
has been roasted, getting our nostrils filled with a
villainous reek. Or are you waiting for a painter to
come and picture you as the companions of Socrates
in prison are portrayed beside him?” They were
indignant and reviled me, and several even took to
their sticks. Then, when I threatened to gather up
a few of them and throw them into the fire, so that
they might follow their master, they checked them-
selves and kept the peace.
As I returned, I was thinking busily, my friend,
reflecting what a strange thing love of glory is;
how this passion alone is unescapable even by those
who are considered wholly admirable, let alone that
man who in other respects had led a life that was
insane and reckless, and not undeserving of the fire.
Then I encountered many peaple coming out to see
the show themselves, for they expected to find him
still alive. You see, on the day before it had been
given out that he would greet the rising sun, as, in fact,
they say the Brahmans do, before mounting the pyre.

Well, I turned back most of them by saying the
deed had been done already, those to whom it was
not in itself highly desirable to see the actual spot,
anyhow, and gather up some relic of the fire.
In that business, I assure you, my friend, I had no
end of trouble, telling the story to all while they
asked questions and sought exact information.
Whenever I noticed a man of taste, I would tell him
the facts without embellishment, as I have to you;
but for the benefit of the dullards, agog to listen,
I would thicken the plot a bit on my own account,
saying that when the pyre was kindled and Proteus
flung himself bodily in, a great earthquake first took
place, accompanied by a bellowing of the ground, and
then a vulture, flying up out of the midst of the flames,
went off to Heaven,! saying, in human speech, with
a loud voice:
“Tam through with the earth; to Olympus I fare.”
They were wonder-struck and blessed themselves
with a shudder, and asked me whether the vulture
sped eastwards or westwards; I made them whatever
reply occurred to me.
On my return to the festival, I came upon a grey-
haired man whose face, I assure you, inspired con-
fidence in addition to his beard and his general air
of consequence, telling all about Proteus, and how,
since his cremation, he had beheld him in white
raiment a little while ago, and had just now left him
walking about cheerfully in the Portico of the Seven
Voices,? wearing a garland of wild olive. Then on
2 This was a portico on the east side of the Altis which
had a sevenfold echo (Pausan., V, 21, 17; Pliny, XXXVI,
100).

top of it all he put the vulture, swearing that he
himself had seen it flying up out of the pyre, when I
myself had just previously let it fly to ridicule fools
and dullards.
Imagine what is likely to happen in his honour
hereafter, how many bees will not settle on the
place, what cicadas will not sing upon it, what crows
will not fly to it, as they did to the tomb of Hesiod,!
and so forth! As to statues, I know that many will
be set up right soon by the Eleans themselves and
also by the other Greeks, to whom he said he had
sent letters. The. story is that he despatched
missives to almost all the famous cities—testamentary
dispositions, so to speak, and exhortations and
prescriptions—and he appointed a number of
ambassadors for this purpose from among his com-
rades, styling them “ messengers from the dead ”
and “ underworld couriers.” 2
So ended that poor wretch Proteus, a man who (to
put it briefly) never fixed his gaze on the verities,
but always did and said everything with a view to
glory and the praise of the multitude, even to the

afflicted by a plague, the Delphic priestess told its people
that their only salvation was to bring there from Naupactus
the bones of Hesiod, and that a crow would show them the
tomb. Her words were borne out by the event.
2 In the letters of Ignatius he recommends to the Church
of Smyrna the election of a special messenger, styled ‘“‘ ambas-
sador of God’? (OeompeoBeuris : ad Smyrn., 11) or “ courier
of God’? (Peodpdy0s : ad Polyc., 7), to be sent to Syria. The
verbal coincidence is notable (cf. Lightfoot), and seems to
indicate a knowledge of these letters, but on the part of
Peregrinus, not Lucian.

extent of leaping into fire, when he was sure not to
enjoy the praise because he could not hear it.
I shall add one thing more to my story before I
stop, in order that you may be able to have a good
laugh. For of course you have long known that other
tale of mine, as you heard it from me at once, when
on my return from Syria I recounted how I sailed from
the Troad in his company, and about his self-in-
dulgence on the voyage, and the handsome boy
whom he had persuaded to turn Cynic that he too
might have an Alcibiades, and how, when we were
disturbed during the night in mid-Aegean by a
tempest that descended and raised an enormous
sea, this wondrous person who was thought to be
superior to death fell to walling along with the
women! Well, ashort time before his end, about nine
days, it may be, having eaten more than enough, I
suppose, he was sick during the night and was taken
with a very violent fever. This was told me by
Alexander the physician, who had been called in to
see him. He said that he found him rolling on the
ground, unable to stand the burning, pleading very
passionately for a drink of cold water, but that he
would not give it to him. Moreover, he told him,
he said, that Death, if he absolutely wanted him, had
come to his door spontaneously, so that it would be
well to go along, without asking any favour from the
fire; and Proteus replied: ‘‘ But that way would not
be so notable, being common to all men.”
aside Levi's interpretation of dyad as meaning lutta d’amore,
but his own defence of it as meaning “‘discrimen” does not
properly reckon with the context. -The archetype had a
peculiar pointed w, frequently confused with a: and , and
these with it.

That is Alexander’s story. And I myself not many
days previously saw him smeared with ointment in
order that the sharp salve might relieve his vision by
making him shed tears. Do you get the idea?
Aeacus is reluctant to receive people with weak eyes!
It is as if a man about to go up to the cross should
nurse the bruise on his finger. What do you think
Democritus would have done, had he seen this?
Would not he have laughed at the man as roundly
as he deserved? And yet, where could he have got
that much laughter? Well, my friend, you may have
your laugh also, particularly when you hear the rest
of them admiring him.

1 The Olympic games were timed to come at the full of the

<div type="translation" n="tlg0062.tlg043">
<head>THE RUNAWAYS<note><p>A comic dialogue in three scenes attacking sham philo-
sophers: Peregrinus, the rabble of low fellows masquerading
as Cynics, and one of them whom he dubs “ Cantharus’”’
(Scarabee), describing him as settled at Philippopolis in Thrace
in the company of two other runaway slaves and the errant
wife of a former host of his.</p>
<p>This is assuredly an outgrowth of the hot dispute about
the character and motives of Peregrinus which broke out
even before he leaped into the flames and for months after-
wards must have raged wherever Greek was spoken. Lucian,
deeply involved in it from the first, finds the Cynic advocates
of their new saint so obnoxious that he wishes to make a
direct attack on them. He wants to bring in Peregrinus,
but must do it with care, not only to avoid cutting into the
field of his Peregrinus (by now either out or certainly in
preparation), but above all to prevent Cantharus and his
fellows from escaping the direct issue. His solution is clever.
We gather that the death of their holy man, far from being
regarded in Heaven as the Proper Heraclean ending of a
Heraclean life, is a stench in the nostrils of Zeus, who knows
no more than Apollo what it is all about. Nobody so much
as calls Proteus a philosopher, and Philosophy was not even
there when it happened. He is clearly linked with the false
philosophers of whom she complains; but only by innuendo,
and indignation finds nothing solid to lay hold of.
The dialogue is constructed with unusual attention to the
dramatic effects of suspense and surprise. Philosophy’s
vigorous flailing of the Cynic pack is delayed with obvious
purpose, and the devastating onslaught on Cantharus is
masked to the last possible moment. In handling the search
for him, however, Lucian’s technique is not quite perfect,
since he lets us think at first that it has no definite objective.
Also, towards the end the lines themselves do not always
make it clear who speaks them—a matter in which Lucian is
generally very resourceful (A. R. Bellinger, Yale Classical
Studies, I [1928], pp. 3-40). Either he was hasty or he had
not yet attained his later facility.</p>
<p>The dialogue was written late in 165 or early in a.p. 166,
almost certainly in Philippopolis.</p></note></head>

APOLLO
Is the report true, father, that someone threw
himself bodily into the fire, in the very face of the
Olympic festivities, quite an elderly man, not a bad
hand at such hocus-pocus? Selene told me, saying
that she herself had seen him burning.
ZEUS
Yes, quite true, Apollo. If only it had never
happened!
APOLLO
Was the old man so good? Was he not worthy of
a death by fire?
ZEUS
Yes, that he was, very likely.2 But my point is
that I remember having had to put up with a great
deal of annoyance at the time on account of a horrid
stench such as you might expect to arise from roasting
human bodies. In fact, if I had not at once gone
straight to Araby, I should have come to a sad end,
subtle to have misled more than one scholar into the notion
that Zeus (and therefore Lucian) is praising Peregrinus.
Nothing could be farther from his (or Lucian’s) real thought,
that the fellow deserved death. The ambiguity is of course
deliberate, to foil and annoy “Scarabee” and his sort; cf.

you may depend on it, from the awfulness of the
reek. Even as it was, amid all that fragrance and
abundance of sweet scents, with frankincense in
profusion, my nostrils hardly consented to forget and
unlearn the taint of that odour; why, even now I
almost retch at the memory of it!
APOLLO
What was his idea, Zeus, in doing that to himself,
or what was the good of his getting incinerated by
jumping into the blazing pyre?

Well, that criticism, my boy, you had better
address first to Empedocles, who himself sprung into
that crater in Sicily.

wanting to do it?

I will repeat for you a speech of his own, which he
delivered to the assembled pilgrims, defending him-
self before them for putting an end to himself. He
said, if my memory serves me—But who is this
woman coming up in haste, excited and tearful, like
someone suffering great wrongs? Stay, it is Philo-
sophy, and she is calling upon me by name, in bitter-
ness of spirit. Why the tears, my daughter? Why
have you left the world and come here? Surely it

PHILOSOPHY
Nothing of the sort, father. On the contrary,
they—the multitude—spoke well of me and held me
in honour, respecting, admiring, and all but worship-
ping me, even if they did not much understand what
I said. But the others—how shall I style them?—
those who say they are my familiars and friends and
creep under the cloak of my name, they are the
people who have done me the direst possible injuries.

By no means, father. Why, they themselves have
been wronged in common with me!
ZEUS
At whose hands, then, have you been wronged,
if you have no fault to find either with the common
sort or with the philosophers ?
PHILOSOPHY
There are some, Zeus, who occupy a middle ground
between the multitude and the philosophers. In
deportment, glance, and gait they are like us, and
similarly dressed; as a matter of fact, they want to
be enlisted under my command and they enroll them-
selves under my name, saying that they are my

disturbed it, you pitied humanity, harried as it was
by ignorance, and therefore sent me down, enjoining
me to see to it that they should stop wronging each
other, doing violence, and living like beasts; that
they should instead fix their eyes on the verities and
manage their society more peaceably. Anyhow, you
said to me in sending me down: ‘“‘ What men do
and how they are affected by stupidity, daughter,
you see for yourself. I pity them, and so, as I think
that you alone might be able to cure what is going
on, I have selected you from among us all and send
you to effect the cure.”
ZEUS
I know I said a great deal at the time, including all
this. But go on and tell me what followed, how they
received you when you flew down for the first time
and what has befallen you now at their hands.

PHILOSOPHY
When I sped off, father, I did not head for the
Greeks straightway, but as it seemed to me the more
difficult part of my task to educate and instruct the
foreigners, I decided to do that first ; the Greek world
I let be, as possible to subject very easily and likely
(I thought so, anyhow) to take the bridle and submit
to the harness very soon. Making for the Indians
to begin with, the most numerous population in the
world, I had na difficulty about persuading them to
come down off their elephants and associate with
me. Consequently, a whole tribe, the Brahmans,
who border upon the Nechraei and the Oxydracae,}
are all enlisted under my command and not only live
in accordance with my tenets, honoured by all their
neighbours, but die a marvellous kind of death.
ZEUS
You mean the gymnosophists.2_ Anyhow, I am
told, among other things about them, that they
ascend a very lofty pyre and endure cremation with-
out any change in their outward appearance or their
sitting position.2 But that is nothing much. Just
now, for example, at Olympia I saw the same sort of
thing done, and very likely you too were there at the
time when the old man was burned.
1 The Nechraei are not mentioned elsewhere, unless, as
Fritzsche suggests, they are the Nereae of Pliny (Nat. Hist.,
VI, 76). The Oxydracae made themselves famous by their
resolute opposition to the invasion of Alexander; they lived
in the Punjab. ;
2 A generic name given by the Greeks to the holy men
of India who lived naked.
* Apparently a correction of Peregrinus, where (p. 30) the
position is spoken of as “lying.”

PHILOSOPHY
I did not even go to Olympia, father, for fear of
those detestable fellows whom I spoke of, since I
saw many of them taking their way there in order to
upbraid the assembled pilgrims and fill the back room
of the temple with the noise of their howling.
Consequently, I did not see how he died.
But to resume—after the Brahmans I went direct
to Ethiopia, and then down to Egypt; and after
associating with their priests and prophets and
instructing them in religion, I departed for Babylon,
to initiate Chaldeans and Magi; then from there to
Scythia, and then to Thrace, where I conversed with
Eumolpus and Orpheus, whom I sent in advance to
Greece, one of them, Eumolpus, to give them the
mysteries, as he had learned all about religion from
me, and the other to win them over by the witchery
of his music. Then I followed at once on their
heels.
Just at first, on my arrival, the Greeks neither
welcomed me very warmly nor shut the door in m
face outright. But gradually, as I associated wit
them, I attached to myself seven companions and
pupils from among them all; then another from
Samos, another from Ephesus, and one more from
Abdera—only a few in all
After them, the Sophist tribe somehow or other
fastened themselves to my skirts. They were
neither profoundly interested in my teaching nor
Mytilene, Bias of Priene, Solon of Athens, Cleobulus of Lindos,
Myson of Chenae, and Chilon of Sparta; but Periander of
Corinth was often included instead of Myson. The three
whom Philosophy acquired later were Pythagoras of Samos,.
Heraclitus of Ephesus, and Democritus of Abdera.

altogether at variance, but like the Hippocentaur
breed, something composite and mixed, astray in the
interspace between quackery and philosophy, neither
completely addicted to ignorance nor yet able to keep
me envisioned with an intent gaze; being purblind,
as it were, through their dim-sightedness they merely
glimpsed at times an indistinct, dim presentment or
shadow of me, yet thought they had discerned every-
thing with accuracy. So there flared up among them
that useless and superfluous ‘“ wisdom ”’ of theirs,
in their own opinion invincible—those clever, baffling,
absurd replies and perplexing, mazy queries. Then,
on being checked and shown up by my comrades,
they were indignant and combined against them, at
length bringing them before courts and handing
them over to drink the hemlock. I ought perhaps
at that time to have fled incontinently, no longer
putting up with their company; but Antisthenes
and Diogenes, and presently Crates and Menippus,
ou know,! persuaded me to mete them out an
additional modicum of delay. O that I had not done
so! for I should not have undergone such sufferings
later.
ZEUS
You have not yet told me what wrongs have been
done you, Philosophy; you merely vent your
indignation.
1 “This” Menippus, not because Lucian thinks of him as
attendin Fhilpeop. y in her return to Heaven, or still less
because he is carelessly adapting something by Menippus in
which that was the case (Helm), but simply because when
Lucian wrote these words Menippus enjoyed among the
reading public a high degree of popularity, to which by this
time Lucian himself had contributed significantly:

PHILOSOPHY
But do listen, Zeus, and hear how great they
are. There is an abominable class of men, for the
most part slaves and hirelings, who had nothing to do
with me in childhood for lack of leisure, since they
were performing the work of slaves or hirelings or
learning such trades as you would expect their like
to learn—cobbling, building, busying themselves with
fuller’s tubs, or carding wool to make it easy for the
women to work, easy to wind, and easy to draw off
when they twist a yarn or spin a thread. Well, while
they were following such occupations in youth, they
did not even know my name. But when they began
to be reckoned as adults and noticed how much respect
my companions have from the multitude and how men
tolerate their plain-speaking, delight in their minis-
trations, hearken to their advice, and cower under
their censure, they considered all this to be a
suzerainty of no mean order.
Now to learn all that is requisite for such a calling
would have been a long task, say rather an impossible
one. Their trades, however, were petty, laborious,
and barely able to supply them with just enough.
To some, moreover, servitude seemed grievous and
(as indeed it is) intolerable. It seemed best to them,
therefore, as they reflected upon the matter, to let
go their last anchor, which men that sail the seas call
the “sacred” one; so, resorting to good old Des-
peration, inviting the support, too, of Hardihood,
Stupidity, and Shamelessness, who are their principal
partisans, and committing to memory novel terms of
abuse, in order to have them at hand and at their
1 Nowadays known as the “ sheet’ anchor.

(you perceive what a rare equipment it is for philo-
sophy), they very plausibly transform themselves in
looks and apparel to counterfeit my very self, doing,
I vow, the same sort of thing that Aesop says the

What characterises us is very easily attainable, as
you know, and open to imitation—I mean what
meets the eye. It does not require much ceremony
to don a short cloak, sling on a wallet, carry a staff in
one’s hand, and shout—say rather, bray, or howl,
and slang everyone. Assurance of not suffering for
it was bound to be afforded them by the usual respect
for the cloth. Freedom is in prospect, against the
will of their master, who, even if he should care to
assert possession by force, would get beaten with the
staff. Bread, too, is no longer scanty or, as before,
limited to bannocks of barley ; and what goes with it
is not salt fish or thyme but meat of all sorts and wine
of the sweetest, and money from whomsoever they
will; for they collect tribute, going from house to
house, or, as they themselves express it, they “ shear
the sheep ”; and they expect many to give, either
out of respect for their cloth or for fear of their
abusive language.
Moreover, they discerned, I assume, the further
advantage that they would be on an equal footing
with true philosophers, and that there would be
nobody who could pass judgment and draw distinc-
tions in such matters, if only the externals were
similar. For, to begin with, they do not even

tolerate investigation if you question them ever so
temperately and concisely; at once they begin
shouting and take refuge in their peculiar citadel,
abusiveness and a ready staff. Also, if you ask about
their works, their words are copious, and if you wish
to judge them by their words, they want you to
consider their lives.
Consequently, every city is filled with such up-
starts, particularly with those who enter the names
of Diogenes, Antisthenes, and Crates as their patrons
and enlist in the army ofthe dog. Those fellows have
not in any way imitated the good that there is in the
nature of dogs, as, for instance, guarding property,
keeping at home, loving their masters, or remember-
ing kindnesses, but their barking, gluttony, thievish-
ness, excessive interest in females, truckling, fawning
upon people who give them things, and hanging
about tables—all this they have copied with painful
accuracy.
You shall see what will happen presently. All the
men in the workshops will spring to their feet and
leave their trades deserted when they see that by
toiling and moiling from morning till night, doubled
over their tasks, they merely eke out a bare existence
from such wage-earning, while idle frauds live in
unlimited plenty, asking for things in a lordly way,
getting them without effort, acting indignant if they
do not, and bestowing no praise even if they do. It
seems to them that this is ‘life in the age of Cronus,’
and really that sheer honey is distilling into their
mouths from the sky!
The thing would not be so dreadful if they offended
against us only by being what they are. But

reverend and stern, if they get a handsome boy
or a pretty woman in their clutches or hope to, it is
best to veil their conduct in silence. Some even
carry off the wives of their hosts,! to seduce them after
the pattern of that young Trojan,? pretending that
the women are going to become philosophers; then
they tender them, as common property, to all their
associates and think they are carrying out a tenet of
Plato’s,? when they do not know on what terms that
holy man thought it right for women to be so
regarded. What they do at drinking-parties, how
intoxicated they become, would make a long story.
And while they do all this, you cannot imagine how
they berate drunkenness and adultery and lewdness
and covetousness. Indeed you could not find any
two things so opposed to each other as their words
and their deeds. For instance, they claim to hate
toadying, when as far as that goes they are able to
outdo Gnathonides or Struthias;4 and although
they exhort everyone else to tell the truth, they
themselves cannot so much as move their tongues
except ina lie. To all of them pleasure is nominally
an odious thing and Epicurus a foeman; but in
practice they do everything for the sake of it. In
irascibility, pettishness, and proneness to anger they
are beyond young children ; indeed, they give no little
amusement to onlookers when their blood boils up in
4 Gluttonous parasites of the New Comedy. Struthias,
whose name is evidently connected with the greediness of the
sparrow, figures in the Toady (Colaz) of Menander. The
play in which Gnathonides appeared is unknown, but Gnatho
(“ Fowl?) is mentioned by Plutarch to exemplify a typical
rasite (Symp., VII, 6, 2), and in utilising part of the Toady
for his Hunuchus Terence changed the name of the chief réle
from Struthias to Gnatho.

them for some trivial reason, so that they look livid in
colour, with a reckless, insane stare, and foam (or
rather, venom) fills their mouths.
And “ may you never chance to be there ”? when
that vile filth of theirs is exuded! “ As to gold or
silver, Heracles! I do not want even to ownit. An
obol is enough, so that I can buy lupines, for a spring
or a stream will supply me with drink.” Then after
a little they demand, not obols nor a few drachmas,
but whole fortunes. What shipman could make as
much from his cargoes as philosophy contributes
to these fellows in the way of gain? And then,
when they have levied tribute and stocked them-
selves up to their heart’s content, throwing off
that ill-conditioned philosopher’s cloak, they buy
farms every now and then, and luxurious cloth-
ing, and long-haired pages, and whole apartment-
houses, bidding a long farewell to the wallet of
Crates, the mantle of Antisthenes, and the jar of
Diogenes.
The unschooled, seeing all this, now spit scorn-
fully at philosophy, thinking that all of us are like
this and blaming me for my teachings, so that for
a long time now it has been impossible for me
to win over a single one of them. I am in the
same fix as Penelope,? for truly all that I weave
is instantly unravelled again; and Stupidity and
Wrongdoing laugh in my face to see that I cannot
bring my work to completion and my toil to an
end.
1 The words are those of Circe to Odysseus, alluding to
Charybdis (Odyssey, XII, 106).
2 The story of Penelope’s web is told several times in the
Odyssey ; II, 93-110; XIX, 138-156; XXIV, 129-146.

ZEUS
Ye gods! what treatment our dear Philosophy has
had from those scoundrels! It is high time, then,
to see what is to be done and how they are to be
punished. Well, the thunderbolt despatches at a
single blow, and the death is a swift one.
APOLLO
I will offer you a suggestion, father, for I myself
have come to detest the knaves; the Muses mean
nothing to them, so I am indignant on behalf of the
Nine. Those fellows are by no means worthy of a
thunderbolt or of that right hand of yours. Send
Hermes down to get after them, if you think best,
with unlimited powers in the matter of their punish-
ment. As he himself is interested in argumentation,
he will very soon know those who are genuine students
of philosophy and those who are not. Then he will
commend the former, naturally, and the latter will
be punished as he sees fit in the circumstances.
ZEUS
A good idea, Apollo. But you go too, Heracles;
take along Philosophy herself and all be off, as
quickly as you can, to the world. Bear in mind
that you will be doing a thirteenth labour of no mean
order if you exterminate such pestilential, shameless
beasts.
HERACLES
On my word, father, I should have preferred to
clean out the muck of Augeas once more, rather than
to get involved with these creatures. Let us be off,
however.

PHILOSOPHY
I do not want to go with you, but I must, in
accordance with father’s orders.
HERMES
Let us be going down, so that we may exterminate
at least a few of them to-day. What direction should
we take, Philosophy? You know where they are.
In Greece, no doubt?
PHILOSOPHY
Not by any means, or only a few, those who are
genuine students of philosophy, Hermes. These
others have no use for Attic poverty; we must look
for them in some quarter where much gold or silver
is mined.
HERMES
Then we must make straight for Thrace.
HERACLES
Quite right, and indeed I will show you the way,
as I know the whole of Thrace from repeated visits.
So, if you please, let us now take this direction.
HERMES
What direction do you mean?
HERACLES
Do you see two ranges, Hermes and Philosophy,
the highest and most beautiful of all mountains (the
higher is Haemus, the one opposite is Rhodope), and
a plain of great fertility outspread beneath them,
beginning at the very foothills of each? Also,

rough as to be shapeless? They look like multiple
citadels belonging to the city beneath them. For the
city, too, is now in sight.
HERMES
Yes, by Zeus, Heracles, the greatest and loveliest
of all cities! In fact, its beauty is radiant from afar.
And also, a very large river flows past it, coming quite
close to it.
HERACLES
That is the Hebrus, and the city was built by the
famous Philip.1_ We are now close to earth and the
clouds are above us, so let us make a landing, with
the blessing of Heaven.
HERMES
Very well. But what is to be done now? How
are we to track the beasts out?
HERACLES
That is up to you, Hermes; you are a crier, so be
quick and do your office.
HERMES
Nothing hard about that, but I do not know their
names. Tell me, Philosophy, what I am to call them,
and their marks of identification as well.

I myself do not know for certain what they are
called, because of my not having had anything to do
with them ever. But to judge from the craving for

if you call them Richman or Richmews or Richrenown
or Goodrich or Richards.
HERMES
Right you are.—But who are these people and why
are they too looking about them? However, they
are coming up and want to ask a question.
HUSBAND
Could you tell us, gentlemen, or you, kind lady,
whether you have seen three rogues together, and a
woman with her hair closely clipped in the Spartan
style, boyish-looking and quite masculine ?
PHILOSOPHY
Aha! They are looking for our quarry!
HUSBAND
How yours? Those fellows are all fugitive slaves,
and for my part I am particularly in search of the
woman, whom they have kidnapped.
HERMES
You will soon find out why we are in search of
them. But at present let us make a joint proclama-
tion.
«If anyone has seen a Paphlagonian slave, one of
those barbarians from Sinope, with a name of the
kind that has ‘rich’ in it, sallow, close-cropped,!
wearing a long beard, with a wallet slung from his
shoulder and a short cloak about him, quick-
1 As a Cynic, the man should wear his hair long; but we
are informed that he has Stoic leanings (§ 31).

FIRST SLAVE-OWNER
Your proclamation does not tally, man! His name
when I had him was Scarabee; furthermore, he
wore his hair long, kept his chin hairless, and knew my
trade. It was his business to sit in my fuller’s shop
and shear off the excessive nap that makes cloaks
fuzzy.
PHILOSOPHY
That is the very man, your slave; but now he
looks like a philosopher, for he has given himself a
thorough dry-cleaning.
FIRST SLAVE-OWNER (to Second and Third)
The impudence of him! Scarabee is setting up
for a philosopher, she says, and we do not enter into
his speculations at all!
SECOND SLAVE-OWNER
Never mind, we shall find them all, for this woman
knows them, by what she says.
HERMES»
Who is this other person coming up, Heracles,
the handsome man with the lyre?
HERACLES
It is Orpheus, my shipmate on the Argo, the
most tuneful of all chanteymen. Indeed, as we
rowed to his singing, we hardly grew tired at all.

Good-day to you, Orpheus, best of men and first of
musicians. Surely you have not forgotten Heracles.
ORPHEUS
A very good-day to you also, Philosophy, Heracles,
and Hermes. But the time has come to pay your
reward, since I am very well acquainted with the
man for whom you are looking.
HERMES
Then show us where he is, son of Calliope, for you
have no need of gold, I take it, being a wise man.
ORPHEUS
You are right. I will show you the house where
he lives, but not the man himself, so as not to be
slanged by him. He is excessively foul-mouthed;
that is the only thing he has thoroughly mastered.
HERMES
Only show us.
ORPHEUS
Here it is, close by. I am going away from your
neighbourhood, so that I may not even see him.
PHILOSOPHY
Hold! Is not that the voice of a woman, reciting
something of Homer’s?

Yes, I am his master, but even so, I gladly consign -
him to perdition !
Why?
HERMES
THIRD SLAVE-OWNER
Because he is a fearful sort of rotter. The name
we used to call him was Stinkadore.

1 Lucian is playing on names here. When Scarabee was
a Cynic, he had gone to the “ dogs.’? Now, as a devotee of
gold, he can only be styled a Chrysippean; ergo a Stoic.
It may be that Lucian is japing at something in the history
of Cleanthes with his talk about beards and hanging, but
there is no evidence except a late scholium on Longaevi, 19,
which says that Cleanthes died of starvation or strangulation.
Anyhow, hanging Scarabee up by the beard will certainly
make a “ Famous Posy’? of him.

to live with her husband. This pair of runaway

continue to learn their former trades; Pomander
to wash dirty linen, Stinkadore once again to mend
torn cloaks; but first they shall both be beaten
with mallows.. Finally, this fellow (to scaRABEE)
8 This meant a good caning, for the mallow that is meant
is the kind that according to Theophrastus “grows tall and
becomes tree-like’’ and “‘ becomes as great as a spear, and
men accordingly use it as a walking-stick’? (Lavatera
arborea; see Sir A. Hort’s Theophrastus, Enguiry into Plants
(L.C.L.), Vol. I, p. 25, and Vol. II, p. 463). But probably its
prescription by Lucian in this and other similar cases is due
in part at least to the implication of ‘softness’ in the name.

<div type="translation" n="tlg0062.tlg044">
<head>TOXARIS, OR FRIENDSHIP<note><p>A conversation between Toxaris, a Scythian, and Mnesippus,
a Greek, on the subject of friendship. Toxaris explains that
the memory of Orestes and Pylades is honoured in Scythia
despite the havoc they wrought there because the Scythians
regard them as models of loyal friendship, which they hold in
the highest esteem. The Greeks, he thinks, are better now-
adays at praising than at practising it. To settle the question
of superiority, Mnesippus tells five stories of Greek loyalty,
and Toxaris five of Scythian: all are declared on oath to be
authentic and recent happenings. The outcome, however,
can only be a draw because no umpire has been appointed,
and the two swear friendship with each other.
The stories, then, are the thing, and the dialogue is just a
framing-tale in which to display them. Its time is present.
Toxaris, therefore, has nothing but the name in common with
the Toxaris whom Lucian in his Scythian (Vol. VI) represents
to have come to Athens before Anacharsis and to have
received worship there after death as the Hero-Physician.
Yet this Toxaris too has visited Athens and lived long among
the Greeks. The dialogue takes place somewhere in Hellas,
but the scene is not definitely fixed. The manner of the
allusion to Athens in § 21 seems to exclude that city. The
diction of the piece suggests a relatively early date. It
may have been written about a.p. 163 in Asia.
The oaths of Toxaris and Mnesippus attest Lucian’s
mastery of the stock devices of a story-teller rather than the
authenticity of his tales. Most of his stories, both Scythian
and Greek, are probable enough to be founded on fact.
Several are notably romantic, and were probably either made
up by Lucian or borrowed from current romances, in which
the hero usually had a friend as well as a sweetheart (cf.
A. Calderini, Caritone di Afrodisia, pp. 104-106). In the
matter of Scythia his dependence on literary sources has
been indicated by Rostovtzeff (Skythien und der Bosporus,
pp. 96-99), who has pointed out that his background is
realistic and plausible in its general effect, but inaccurate in
historical and. geographic details, and argues that he drew
extensively upon Greek novels with a Scythian plot.</p></note></head>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="1"><p>

MNESIPPUS
What about it, Toxaris? Do you Scythians
sacrifice to Orestes and Pylades, and have you come
to believe that they are gods?
TOXARIS
We sacrifice, Mnesippus, we sacrifice; not, how-
ever, because we think them gods, but good men.!
MNESIPPUS
Is it your custom to sacrifice to good men when
they are dead, as if they were gods?
TOXARIS
Not only that, but we honour them with festivals
and pilgrimages.
MNESIPPUS
What do you crave from them? For surely it is
not to gain their grace that you sacrifice to them, in
view of the fact that they are dead.
1 The existence of a cult of Orestes and Pylades in Scythia
is not otherwise attested, and is credible only in a limited
sense, as a local development of Greek hero-worship; see
below, on the Oresteum, § 6.

1 Both here and below in § 6 Lucian omits as self-understood
the point that Orestes discovers the priestess to be his sister
Iphigenia, previously thought to have perished at Aulis
under the sacrificial knife.
2 In the point that this version of the story makes the Greeks
escape by overpowering the Scythians and killing Thoas,
their king, it differs significantly both from Euripides in the
Iphigenia among the Taurians and from Sophocles in the
Chryses, in which Thoas was killed, to be sure, but only after
they had somehow got away and he had overtaken them at
‘* Sminthe,” whose ruler, Chryses, turning out to be the son
of Agamemnon and Chryseis, and so the half-brother of
Orestes and Iphigenia, aids them to kill their pursuer.
Elsewhere in extant ancient literature the Lucianic version

<note type="head">TOXARIS, OR FRIENDSHIP</head>
TOXARIS
Well, we should be none the worse off, perhaps,
if even the dead should be gracious to us. However,
we think it will be better for the living if we do
not forget men of high achievement, and we honour
them after death because we consider that in this
way we can get many to wish to become like them.
MNESIPPUS
In that matter, to be sure, your judgement is
sound. But as regards Orestes and Pylades, on
just what ground did you so admire them, that you
have put them on a parity with the gods, and that
too when they were trespassers upon your soil and—
what is most significant—enemies? Why, when the
Scythians of that day seized them after their ship-
wreck and dragged them off intending to sacrifice
them to Artemis, they set upon the keepers of their
prison, overpowered the watch, and not only slew
the king but carried off the priestess,1 nay even kid-
napped Artemis herself, and then went. sailing
away, after having made a mock of the Scythian
commonwealth.? So if that is why you honour those
is found only in Servius and in accounts derived from him
(Serv. in Aen., II, 216; cf. [Hyginus], 261, and Mythogr. Vat.,
II, 202). It may have been the accepted version of the cult
of Diana at Aricia (Preller, Robert), but cannot be of Latin
origin. It is surely the early version, effaced in the literary
tradition by the influence of Euripides, but perpetuated
(as early myths often were) in art through a painting by some
famous Hellenistic master, later reflected not only in Graeco-
Roman sarcophagus-reliefs but in the murals of some Graeco-
Scythian Oresteum (§6). Lucian’s knowledge of it may
sately. be ascribed to an allusion to those murals in the literary
source from which he derives the curious mixture of fact and
fiction in § 6.

heroes, you will very soon produce many like them!
Draw the conclusion for yourselves in the light of
what happened of old whether it is desirable for you
that many an Orestes and Pylades should descend
upon Scythia. To me it seems that very soon, under
those conditions, you would become irreligious your-
selves, yes, godless, after the remainder of your gods
had been similarly shipped out of the country to
foreign parts. And then, I suppose, in place of the
whole company of gods, you will deify the men who
came to obtain them for export and will sacrifice
to the robbers of your temples as gods!
If that is not why you honour Orestes and Pylades,
do tell me, Toxaris, what other benefit have they
done you to bring it about that although formerly
you deemed them anything but gods, now, on the
contrary, you have made them pass for gods by
sacrificing to them, and you now bring victims to
men who at that time very nearly became victims ?
This conduct, you know, might be thought ridiculous
and inconsistent with that of former times.
TOXARIS
As a matter of fact, Mnesippus, even these actions
that you have described evince nobility in those
men. That two should dare so bold a deed; that
they should sail so far from their own country as to
cruise out into the Pontus (still unexplored by any
of the Greeks except the force that fared upon the
Argo to Colchis) undismayed either by the fables
regarding it or by its name through any terror
inspired by the fact that it was called ‘ Inhos-
pitable ” (I suppose because savage peoples dwelt

all about it);1 that after their capture they faced
the situation so courageously, and were not content
simply to make their escape but punished the king
for his insolence and took Artemis with them when
they sailed away—why is not all this admirable and
worthy of divine honour in some sort from all who
praise manhood? Yet that is not what we see in
Orestes and Pylades, to treat them as heroes.
MNESIPPUS
Please go on and say what else they did that
is imposing and godlike ; since as far as concerns their
voyage and their foreign travel I could point you
many who are more godlike than they—the merchant
traders, and particularly the Phoenicians among
them, who not only sail into the Pontus or as far as
Lake Maeotis and the Cimmerian Bosporus,? but
cruise everywhere in Greek and foreign waters; for
these fellows comb every single shore and every strand,
you may say, each year before returning late in the
autumn to their own country. On the same principle,
you should account them gods, even though most of
them are pedlars and, it may be, fishmongers !
TOXARIS
Listen then, you amazing fellow, and learn how
much more generously than you Greeks we bar-
barians judge good men. In Argos and Mycenae
there is not even a respectable tomb of Orestes or
1 According to Apollodorus (Strabo, VII, 298-299) the
Pontus was at first called Azeinos (‘‘ Inhospitable ”) because
of its storminess and the ferocity of the tribes that surrounded
it; later, after the Ionian settlements on its coast, it was
called Huxeinos (‘‘ Hospitable”). Pindar knows both names
(Pyth., IV, 203; Nem. IV, 49).

1 Nothing could be more natural than for some Graeco-
Scythian city in South Russia (Crimea?) to have had an
Oresteum like this, with a set of murals commemorating the
exploits of Orestes and Pylades. Indeed, the existence of the
paintings is practically guaranteed by two considerations:
they represent a version of the story of Orestes among
the Taurians that is not known to us prior to Lucian except
in art; and that version, involving as it does his killing of the
king, is not likely to have been preferred to the Euripidean
by Lucian for his present purpose, if the paintings were imag-
inary. Here there seems to be a core of fact which Lucian
can have derived only from some previous writer; and we may
perhaps also safely believe that the deified heroes obtained
sufficient prestige among the native part of the population of

<note type="head">TOXARIS, OR FRIENDSHIP</head>
Pylades to be seen, but among us a temple has been
assigned them, to both together, as was reasonable
since they were comrades, and sacrifices are offered
them, and all sorts of honours besides. The fact
that they were not Scythians but foreigners is no
hindrance to their having been accounted good men
and their being cherished by the foremost Scythians ;
for we do not enquire what country proper men come
from, nor do we bear a grudge if men who are not
friendly have done noble deeds; we commend what
they have accomplished and count them our own in
virtue of their achievements.
What especially impressed us in these men and
gains our commendation is this: it seemed to us
that as friends they, surely, had proved themselves
the best in the world, and had established precedents
for everyone else in regard to the way in which
friends should share all their fortunes. All that the
went through in each other’s company or for eac
other’s sake our ancestors inscribed on a tablet of
bronze which they set up in the Oresteum: 1 and they
made it the law that the first study and lesson for
the city and its environs to gain them a Scythian name
(Korakoi: §7 end). Compare the Herodotean tale (IV, 103)
of the worship of Iphigenia among the Taurians. This kernel
of fact, however, has been enveloped in a hull of fiction by
transporting the sanctuary to a mythical Scythian capital
without a name and making it the focus of a great national
cult of friendship—a happy conceit in view of the custom
of swearing ‘‘ blood-brotherhood ” (§ 37), but sheer fiction
none the less. It is perhaps possible that Lucian drew the
fact from some Hellenistic AListorian and supplied the fiction
himself; but it is more likely that he found both already com-
bined in his source, and connected with one or more of the
tales of Scythian friendship that he puts into the mouth of
Toxaris (cf. especially p. 173, n. 2).

their children should be this tablet and the memoris-
ing of all that had been written upon it. In point
of fact, every one of them would sooner forget the
name of his own father than fail to know the achieve-
ments of Orestes and Pylades.
But in the temple close, too, the very same matters
that are set forth on the tablet are to be seen repre-
sented in paintings by the ancients; Orestes voyag-
ing with his friend, and then, after his ship had been
destroyed on the rocks, his arrest and preparation
for the sacrifice; Iphigenia is already consecrating
them. Opposite this, on the other wall, he is
depicted as just out of his fetters, slaying Thoas
and many more of the Scythians. Finally, they are
sailing off, with Iphigenia and the goddess; the
Scythians meanwhile are vainly laying hold of the
ship, which is already under way, hanging to the
rudders and trying to get aboard; then, unable to
accomplish anything, they swim back to land, some
of them because they are wounded, others for fear
of that. It is just there that one may see how much
good-will they displayed in each other’s interest;
I mean, in the engagement with the Scythians.
For the artist has portrayed each of them paying
no heed to the foemen opposite himself, but encoun-
tering those who are assailing the other, trying to meet
their missiles in his stead, and counting it nothing
to die if he saves his friend and intercepts with his
— body the stroke that is being directed at the
other.
That great good-will of theirs, that common front
amid those perils, that faithfulness and comradely

love, that genuineness and solidity of their affection
for one another were not, we thought, of this world,
but marked a spirit too noble for these men about
us of the common sort, who, as long as the course of
their friends is with the wind, take it ill if they do
not give them an equal share in all their delights,
but if even a slight breath sets against them, they
bear away, entirely abandoning them to their perils.
For I would have you know this also—Scythians
think that there is nothing greater than friendship,
and there is not anything upon which a Scythian
will pride himself more than on aiding a friend and
sharing his dangers, just as there is no greater dis-
grace among us than to bear the name of having
played false to friendship. That is why we honour
Orestes and Pylades, because they practised best
what Scythians hold good, and excelled in friend-
ship, an achievement which we admire before all
things else; in token whereof we have given them
the name of Korakoi to go by, which in our language
is as much as to say “‘ guiding spirits of friendship.”
MNESIPPUS
Toxaris, it has turned out that Scythians are not
only good archers and better than all others in war-
fare, but the most convincing of all peoples at making
speeches. Anyhow, I, who formerly had a different
opinion, now myself think you do right in thus deifying
Orestes and Pylades. And I had failed, my accom-
plished friend, to grasp the fact that you are also a
good painter. Very animated indeed was the sketch

that you drew for us of the pictures in the Oresteum,
of the fighting of your heroes, and the wounds that
each bore for the other. However, I should not
have expected friendship to be so highly cherished
among the Scythians, for as they are inhospitable
and uncivilised I thought that they always were
well acquainted with hatred, anger, and bad humour
but did not enter into friendship even with their
closest kin, judging by all that we hear about them,
and especially the report that they eat their dead
fathers ! 1
TOXARIS
Whether we are in general not only more just
than the Greeks towards our parents but more
reverential is a question which I would rather not
debate with you at present. But that Scythian
friends are far more faithful than Greek friends
and that friendship matters more with us than with
you is easily demonstrated; and in the name of your
Gods of Greece, do not listen to me with displeasure
if I mention one of the observations which I have
made after having lived with your people for a long
time now.
It seems to me that you Greeks can indeed say
all that is to be said about friendship better than
others, but not only fail to practise its works in a
manner that befits your words,—no, you are content
to have praised it and shown what a very good thing
it is, but in its times of need you play traitor to
your words about it and beat a hasty retreat, some-
how or other, out of the press of deeds. And when-
ever your tragedians put friendships of this kind on

the stage and exhibit them to you, you bestow
praise and applause, yes, even tears upon them,
most of you, when they face danger for each other’s
sake; yet you yourselves dare not come out with
any praiseworthy deed for the sake of your friends.
On the contrary, if a friend happens to stand in need
of anything, those many tragic histories take wing
and vanish from your path on the instant, like
dreams, and leave you looking like those empty,
silent masks which, for all their open mouths, widely
agape, do not utter even the slightest sound. We
are your opposites; for we have as much the better
of you in practising friendship as we fall short of
you in talking about it.
If you like, then, let us do this; let us leave the
friends of former times to rest in peace, whomso-
ever, I mean, of the ancients either we or you are
able to enumerate; for there, to be sure, you would
outdo us by citing many trustworthy witnesses,
your poets, who have rehearsed in the most beautiful
of epic lines and lyric verses the friendship of Achilles
and Patroclus and the comradeship of Theseus,
Peirithous, and all the rest. Instead, let us take up
just a few of our own contemporaries and recount
their deeds, I for the Scythian side, you for the
Greek; then whichever of us wins in this by bring-
ing out better = of friendship shall not only
be adjudged victor himself but shall be allowed to
name his country in the proclamation, inasmuch as
he will have taken part in a right glorious and
noble contest. For my own part, I think I would

much rather be defeated in single combat and have
my right hand cut off, which is the penalty for defeat
in Scythia, than to be pronounced inferior to anyone
else in the matter of friendship, and above all to a
Greek, when I am myself a Scythian.
MNESIPPUS
It is no mean undertaking, Toxaris, to engage in
single combat with a man-at-arms like yourself,
equipped with very accurate and well-sharpened
shafts of speech. Nevertheless, I shall not so
ignobly betray of a sudden the whole Greek cause
as to yield you the field. It would be shocking if,
when they two defeated as many Scythians as are
indicated by the stories and by those ancient paint-
ings in your country which you described with such
histrionic expressiveness a little while ago, all the
Greeks, including so many peoples and so many
cities, should lose by default to you alone. If
that should take place, it would be fitting for me
to be docked, not of my right hand, as your people
are, but of my tongue. But ought we to set our-
selves a limit to the number of these exploits of
friendship, or should we hold that the more of
them a man can tell, the better off he is as regards
the victory ?
TOXARIS
By no means; let us prescribe that the victory
does not in this case reside with the greater numbers.
No, if yours turn out to be better and more telling
‘than mine, though equal in number, they will
obviously inflict more serious wounds upon me and
I shall succumb to your blows more quickly.

MNESIPPUS
You are right, so let us settle how many will do.
Five, I should think, for each. .
TOXARIS
I think so too; and you may speak first, after
taking oath that you will assuredly tell the truth.
Merely to make up such tales is not at all hard, and
there is no obvious means of disproof. But if you
should take your oath, it would not be right to
disbelieve you.
MNESIPPUS
We shall do so, if you really think an oath is
at all essential. But which of our gods will satisfy
you? Zeus Philios?
TOXARIS
Yes indeed; and I will take the oath of my own
country for you when I myself speak.
MNESIPPUS
Well then, as Zeus Philios is my witness, I solemnly
swear that whatever I shall tell you I will say either
from my own knowledge or from information obtained
of others with all the accuracy that was possible,
without contributing any dramaturgy on my own part.
And the first friendship of which I shall give you
an account is that of Agathocles and Deinias, which
has become far-famed among the Ionians.
Agathocles of Samos, to whom I refer, lived not
long ago, and was peerless in friendship, as he
proved, but otherwise not at all superior to the
general run of Samians qjther in family or in means.

He and Deinias, the son of Lyson, of Ephesus,
were friends from their boyhood. But Deinias
turned out to be enormously rich; and as was
natural in one whose wealth was new, he had many
others about him who were well enough as boon
companions and agreeable associates, but as far as
could be from friends.
Well, for a time Agathocles was put to the test
among them, associating with them and drinking
with them, though he took little pleasure in that
kind of pastime; and Deinias held him in no higher
esteem than his toadies. But at length Agathocles
began to give offence by rebuking him frequently,
and. came to be considered a nuisance by reminding
him always of his ancestors and admonishing him
to keep what his father had acquired with much
labour and left to him. Consequently Deinias no
longer even took him along when he caroused about
the town, but used to go alone with those others,
trying to escape the eye of Agathocles.
In course of time those flatterers persuaded the
poor fellow that Charicleia was in love with him.
She was the wife of Demonax, a distinguished man,
foremost among the Ephesians in public affairs.
Notes from the woman kept coming into his house ;
also, half-faded wreaths, apples with a piece bitten
out, and every other contrivance with which go-
betweens lay siege to young men, gradually work-
ing up their love-affairs for them and inflaming them
at the start with the thought that they are adored
(for this is extremely seductive, especially to those
who think themselves handsome), until they fall
unawares into the net.
Charicleia was a dainty piece of femininity, but

outrageously meretricious, giving herself to anyone
who happened to meet her, even if he should want
her at very little cost; if you but looked at her, she
nodded at once, and there was no fear that Charicleia
might perhaps be reluctant. She was clever too, in
every way, and an artist comparable with any
courtesan you please at alluring a lover, bringing
him into complete subjection when he was still of
two minds, and when at last he was in her toils
working him up and fanning his flame, now by anger,
now by flattery, soon by scorn and by pretending to
have an inclination for someone else. She was every
bit of her thoroughly sophisticated, that woman, and
plentifully armed with siege-engines to train upon
her lovers.
This, then, was the ally whom Deinias’ toadies
at that time enlisted against the boy, and they con-
stantly played up to rer lead, unitedly thrusting
him into the affair with Charicleia. And she, who
already had given many young fellows a bad fall,
* who, times without number, had played at being in
love, who had ruined vast estates, versatile and
thoroughly practised mischief-maker that she was—
once she got into her clutches a simple youngster who
had no experience of such enginery, she would not
let him out of her talons but encompassed him all
round about and pierced him through and through,
until, when at last she had him wholly in her power,
she not only lost her own life through her quarry
but caused poor Deinias misfortunes without end.
From the very first she kept baiting him with
those notes, sending her maid continually, making
out that she had cried, that she had lain awake,

and at last that she would hang herself for love,
poor girl, until the blessed simpleton became con-
vinced that he was handsome and adored by the
women of Ephesus, and of course made a rendezvous
after many entreaties. After that, naturally, it
was bound to be an easy matter for him to be cap-
tured by a beautiful woman, who knew how to
please him with her company, to weep on occasion,
to sigh piteously in the midst of her conversation, to
lay hold of him when he was at last going away,
to run up to him when he came in, to adorn herself
in the way that would best please him, and of course
to sing and to strum the lyre.
All this she had brought into play against Deinias ;
and then, when she discerned that he was in a bad
way, having by that time become thoroughly per-
meated with love and pliable, she employed another
artifice to complete the poor boy’s undoing. She pre-
tended to be with child by him (this too is an effective
way to fire a sluggish lover); moreover, she dis-
continued her visits to him, saying that she was
kept in by her husband, who had found out about
their affair.
Deinias was now unable to bear the situation and
could not endure not seeing her. He wept, he sent
his toadies, he called upon the name of Charicleia,
he embraced her statue (having had one of marble
made for him), he wailed; at last he flung himself
on the ground and rolled about, and his condition
was absolute insanity. Naturally, the gifts which
he exchanged for hers were not on a par with apples
and wreaths, but whole apartment-houses, farms,
and serving-women, gay clothing, and all the gold
that she wanted.

Why make a long story of it? In a trice the
estate of Lyson, which had been the most famous
in Ionia, was completely pumped out and exhausted.
And then, when at last he was drained dry, she
left him, pursued another gilded youth from Crete,
and went over to him; now she loved him, and he
put faith in it.
Neglected not only by Charicleia but by the
toadies, for they too had now gone over to the
Cretan whom she loved, Deinias sought out Agatho-
cles, who had long known that things were going
badly with him. Though overcome with shame at
first, nevertheless he told the whole story—his
passion, his desperate straits, the woman’s dis-
regard, the Cretan rival—and in conclusion said
that he would not remain alive if he could not
have Charicleia. Agathocles thought it unseason-
able at that moment to remind Deinias that he used
never to be glad to see him, and him only, of all
his friends, but used always to give preference to
his toadies in those days. So he sold all that he
had, the house that he had inherited in Samos,
and came back bringing him the price, three talents.
When Deinias received this, it was at once patent
to Charicleia that in some way he had once more
become handsome. Again the maid, and the notes,
and reproof because he had not come for a long
while; and the toadies came running up to dangle
a line for him, seeing that Deinias was still good for
a meal. But when he had promised to come to her,
had actually come, in the early hours of the night,
and was inside the house, Demonax, the husband
of Charicleia, whether through accidental detection
of him or through arrangement with his wife—both

stories are told—springing out upon him as if from
ambush, gave orders to lock the outer door and to
seize Deinias, threatening him with burning and
scourging and coming at him with drawn sword,
as an adulterer.
Perceiving what a calamitous situation he was in,
Deinias seized a bar that lay near and killed not
only Demonax himself, striking him on the temple,
but also Charicleia, not with one blow in her case, but
by striking her first with the bar again and again
and afterwards with the sword of Demonax. The
servants stood speechless in the meantime, dazed
by the suddenness of the thing; then they tried to
seize him, but when he made at them too with the
sword, they fled, and Deinias made good his escape
in spite of his monstrous deed.
The time that remained until dawn he spent with
Agathocles in going over all that had happened and
considering what would come of it in future. At
dawn the magistrates appeared, for by then the
thing had been noised abroad; they arrested
Deinias, who himself did not deny that he had
committed the murders, and brought him before the
Salariae’ who then administered Asia. He sent
im to the Emperor, and before long Deinias was
committed to the island of Gyaros, one of the
Cyclades, condemned by the Emperor to live there
in perpetual exile.
Agathocles alone of all his friends kept with him,
sailed with him to Italy, went to the trial with him,
and failed him in nothing. Moreover, when at
length Deinias went into exile, he did not desert his
comrade even then, but of his own accord sentenced
himself to live in Gyaros and share his exile; and

when they were completely in want of necessities,
he joined the purple-fishers, dived with them, brought
home what he earned by this, and so supported
Deinias. Besides, when the latter fell ill, he took care
of him for a very long time, and when he died, did
not care to return again to his own country, but
remained there in the island, ashamed to desert his
friend even after his death.
There you have the deed of a Greek friend which
took place not long ago; I hardly think five years
have passed since Agathocles died in Gyaros.
TOXARIS
I do wish, Mnesippus, you had told this story
without taking an oath, so that I might have been
able to disbelieve it, for this Agathocles whom you
have described is very much of a Scythian friend.
However, I have no fear that you will be able to
name any other like him.
MNESIPPUS
Listen then, Toxaris, to the tale of another,
Euthydicus of Chalcis. It was repeated to me
by Simylus, the sea-captain of Megara, who took his
solemn oath that he himself had seen the deed.
He said that he was making a voyage from Italy to
Athens at about the season of the setting of the
Pleiades, carrying a miscellaneous collection of
assengers, among whom was Euthydicus, and with
im Damon, also of Chalcis, his comrade. They were
of the same age, but Euthydicus was vigorous and
strong, while Damon was pale and sickly, just
convalescing, it seemed, from a prolonged illness.

As far as Sicily they had made a fortunate passage,
said Simylus; but when they had run through the
straits and in due time were sailing in the Adriatic
itself, a great tempest fell upon them. Why repeat
the many details of his story—huge seas, cyclones,
hail, and all the other evils of a storm? But when
they were at last abreast of Zacynthos,}! sailing with
the yard bare, and also dragging hawsers in their
wake to check the fury of their driving, towards
midnight Damon became seasick, as was natural in
weather so rough, and began to vomit, leaning out-
board. Then, I suppose because the ship was hove
down with greater force towards the side over which
he was leaning and the high sea contributed a send,
he fell overboard head-first ; and the poor fellow was
not even without his clothes, so as to have been able
to swim more easily. So he began at once to call for
help, choking and barely able to keep himself above
the water.
When Euthydicus, who happened to be undressed
and in his bunk, heard him, he flung himself into the
sea, got to Damon, who was already giving out (all
this was visible at a long distance because the moon
was shining) and helped him by swimming beside him
and bearing him up. The rest of them, he said,
wanted to aid the men and deplored their misfortune,
but could not do it because the wind that drove them
was too strong; however, they did at least something,
for they threw them a number of pieces of cork
and some spars, on which they might swim if they
chanced upon any of them, and finally even the gang
plank, which was not small.

Think now, in the name of the gods! what firmer
proof of affection could a man display towards a
friend who had fallen overboard at night into a sea so
wild, than that of sharing his death? I beg you,
envisage the tumult of the seas, the roar of the break-
ing water, the boiling spume, the night, the despair ;
then one man strangling, barely keeping up his head,
holding his arms out to his friend, and the other
leaping after him at once, swimming with him, fearing
that Damon would perish first. In that way you can
appreciate that in the case of Euthydicus too it is no
common friend whom I have described.
TOXARIS
Did the men lose their lives, Mnesippus, or were
they unaccountably saved, somehow? I am very
concerned about them.
MNESIPPUS
Never fear, Toxaris; they were saved and are now
at Athens, both of them, studying philosophy.
Simylus, to be sure, could only tell this tale about
what he had once seen in the night—the one falling
overboard, the other leaping after him, and both
swimming as long as he could distinguish them in the
darkness. But the sequel was told by Euthydicus
himself. In the beginning they came upon some
corks on which they supported themselves and kept
afloat uncomfortably, but afterwards, seeing the gang
plank at last, towards daybreak, they swam to it
and then, after climbing upon it, easily drifted to
Zacynthos.

After these friends, who were by no means despic-
able, I should say, let me tell you now of a third who
was not a bit inferior to them.
Eudamidas of Corinth had formed friendships with
Aretaeus of Corinth and Charixenus of Sicyon, who
were both rich, while he was extremely poor. When
he died, he left a will which very likely appeared
ridiculous to everyone else, but I hardly think it will
seem so to you, since you are a good man, a worshipper
of friendship, and a competitor for the first prize in it.
It was set down in the will: “ I leave to Aretaeus my
mother to support and cherish in her old age, and to
Charixenus my daughter to bestow in marriage with
the largest dowry that he can give her out of his
own means ’”’ (besides an aged mother he had also
a daughter, already marriageable); “and if any-
thing should befall either of these men in the
meantime, his interest is to go to the other.” When
this will was read, all who knew of the poverty of
Eudamidas but were unaware of the friendship which
he had with the men considered the thing a joke, and
every one of them went away laughing. ‘ What a
fine fortune Aretaeus and Charixenus, the lucky
fellows, are coming into,” said they, “if they must
pay out money to Eudamidas and have the dead
man inherit from them while they themselves are
still alive!”
The heirs to whom these legacies had been left,
on hearing of it, came at once to administer the will.
Charixenus, to be sure, outlived his friend only five
days; but Aretaeus proved himself the best of
legatees. Assuming both his own interest and the

of five talents that he had, dowries of two talents to
his own daughter and two to his friend’s; moreover,
he thought fit that they should both be married on the
same day.
What is your opinion, Toxaris, of this man
Aretaeus? Has he set a bad example of friendship
in accepting such legacies and not playing false to his
his friend’s last will? Or shall we put him down
among those definitely elected as one of the five?
TOXARIS
Yes, he too is noble; but to me Eudamidas is far
more wonderful for the confidence he had in his
friends. He made it plain that he himself would have
done likewise for them; indeed, he would not have
hung back if it had not been set down in a will, but
would have presented himself before all the rest as
an heir to such bequests by intestate succession.
MNESIPPUS
You are quite right.—As the fourth I shall tell you
of Zenothemis, son of Charmolaus, of Massilia.
He was pointed out to me in Italy when I was
there as an ambassador of my country, a handsome,
tall man, and a wealthy one, it seemed. His wife sat
beside him as he passed through the street on a
chariot ; not only was she repulsive in general, but
her right side was shrivelled and the eye wanting—
a hideously disfigured, unapproachable nightmare.
Then, when I expressed my surprise that he, a
handsome and attractive man, could endure to have
such a woman riding at his side, the person who

had pointed him out told me what had made the
marriage obligatory. He was accurately informed
about it all, for he too was a Massaliote.
“ Menecrates,” he said, “ the father of the mis-
shapen woman yonder, had a friend, Zenothemis,
who, like himself, was wealthy and distinguished.
In course of time Menecrates had his property
confiscated by judicial sentence, when he was
disfranchised by the Six Hundred for presenting
an unconstitutional measure. That,’ said he, “ is
the punishment we Massaliotes inflict whenever
anyone proposes an unconstitutional enactment.
Menecrates was distressed, of course, by the con-
demnation itself, since in a moment he had become
poor instead of rich and dishonoured instead of
honoured; but most of all he was worried about
this daughter, who was then marriageable, and
eighteen; but even with all the wealth which her
father had possessed before his condemnation, no
well-born man, though poor, would readily have
agreed to accept her, so unfortunate was she in
her appearance. It was said, too, that she had
attacks of the falling sickness when the moon was
waxing.
“When he was lamenting these misfortunes to
Zenothemis, the latter said: ‘ Never fear, Mene-
crates; you shall not lack what you need, and your
daughter will find a husband worthy of her lineage.’
As he spoke, he grasped him by the hand, took him
home, and shared his great wealth with him. Also,
he ordered a dinner prepared and invited his friends,
including Menecrates, to a wedding-feast, pretending
to have persuaded one of his comrades to promise to
marry the girl. When their dinner was over and

they had poured the libation to the gods, at that
moment Zenothemis held out to him his cup, full of
wine, and said: ‘ Accept, Menecrates, the loving-
cup from your son-in-law, for I shall this day wed
your daughter Cydimache; her dowry I received
long ago, amounting to twenty-five talents.’ The
other said: ‘No, no, Zenothemis, do not! May I
never be so mad as to suffer you, who are young and
handsome, to make a match with an ugly, disfigured
girl!’ But while he was saying this, Zenothemis
picked up the girl bodily and went into his chamber,
from which he returned presently, after having made
her his wife.
“ From that time on he has lived with her, cherish-
ing her beyond measure and taking her about with him
everywhere, as you see. Not only is he unashamed
of his marriage, but indeed seems to be proud of
it, offering it as proof that he thinks little of physical
beauty or ugliness and of wealth and glory, but has.
high regard for his friend, for Menecrates, and does
not believe that the latter’s worth, as regards
friendship, was lessened by the vote of the Six
Hundred.
Already, however, Fortune has requited him for
this conduct. He has had a beautiful boy by this
ugly woman; and besides, only recently, when the
father took the child in his arms and brought him
into the Senate-house wreathed with leaves of olive
and dressed in black, in order that he might excite
greater pity on behalf of his grandfather, the baby
burst into laughter before the senators and clapped
his two hands, whereupon the senate, softened by
him, set the condemnation aside in favour of Mene-
crates, so that he is now in full possession of his rights

1 There is no need to supply dvw (Hartman). The back-
country (wpa), Egypt, was a thing apart from Alexandria. In
the report of a trial held at Alexandria occurs the statement :
‘Her brother is in Egypt, but will come soon” (Hunt,
Select Papyri (L.C.L.), I, No. 263, 1. 27; cf. 1. 32).

and privileges through employing so tiny an. advocate
to present his case to the members in session.” -
Such are the deeds which, according to the
Massaliote, Zenothemis performed for his friend ;
as you see, they are not trivial, or likely to have
been done by many Scythians, who even in the
matter of concubines are said to be careful to select
the most beautiful.
We have the fifth remaining, and I do not purpose
to forget Demetrius of Sunium and tell of anyone
else.
Demetrius sailed to Egypt with Antiphilus of
Alopece, his friend from boyhood and comrade in their
military training. There they lived and studied
together; he himself followed the Cynic school of
philosophy under that sophist from Rhodes,! while
Antiphilus for his part studied medicine. Well, one
time Demetrius happened to have gone into Egypt
to see the pyramids and the statue of Memnon, for
he had heard that the pyramids, though high, cast
no shadow, and that Memnon utters a cry to the
rising sun. Eager, therefore, to see the pyramids
and tohear Memnon, Demetrius had cruised off up the
Nile six months before, leaving behind him Antiphilus,
who feared the journey and the heat.
In the meantime the latter met with a calamity
which required a very staunch friend. His slave,
Syrus by name and Syrian by nationality, joined
certain temple-robbers, and entered the temple of
1 It has been suggested that this may have been Agatho-
bulus (cf. p. 19, n. 3), but with little to go on except that
Agathobulus must have been teaching Cynicism in Alexandria
at about the time which this tale presupposes for the Rhodian
sophist. It is hardly safe to assume that he cannot have
had any rivals.

Anubis with them. They robbed the god of two
golden libation-bowls, a caduceus, also of gold, some
dog-headed figures of silver, and other such matters,
all of which they left in trust with Syrus. Then,
after their imprisonment (for they were taken when
they tried to sell something), they at once told every-
thing when they were broken on the wheel, came
under escort to the house of Antiphilus, and fetched
out the stolen goods, which were lying under a bed
in a dark corner. Consequently Syrus was confined
at once, and with him his master, Antiphilus, who was
actually seized while he listened to a lecture by his
teacher. Nobody came to his assistance; on the
contrary, even his erstwhile friends turned their backs
upon him on the ground that he had robbed the
Anubideum and considered it an act of impiety on
their own part if they had ever drunk or eaten with
him. Moreover, the two remaining servants bundled
up everything in the house and made off.
Poor Antiphilus therefore remained in confinement
for a long time, regarded as the most villainous of all
the malefactors that there were in the prison, and the
Egyptian keeper, a superstitious fellow, thought to
gratify and avenge his god by exercising his authority
over Antiphilus with a heavy hand. Whenever he
defended himself, saying that he had not done any-
thing of the sort, he was thought brazen-faced, and
was detested much more for it. Consequently, he
sickened at length and was ill, as might be expected
in view of the fact that he slept on the ground and at
night could not even stretch out his legs, which were
confined in the stocks. By day, to be sure, the collar
was sufficient, together with manacles upon one hand ;
but for the night he had to be fully secured by his

bonds. Moreover, the stench of the room and its
stifling air (since many were confined in the same
place, cramped for room, and scarcely able to draw
breath), the clash of iron, the scanty sleep—all these
conditions were difficult and intolerable for such a
man, unwonted to them and unschooled to a life so
rigorous.
He was giving up the struggle and refusing even
to take food when Demetrius came back, knowing
nothing of what had happened until then. As soon
as he found out, he set off, just as he was, straight for
the prison at arun. At that time, however, he was
not admitted, for it was evening and the keeper had
long ago locked the door and gone to sleep, after
directing his servants to keep watch; but in the
morning he obtained admission by vehement entreaty.
After entering he made a long search for Antiphilus,
who had become unrecognisable through his miseries.
He went about examining each of the prisoners just
as people do who seek out their own dead amon
the altered bodies on battle-fields. Indeed, had he
not called his name aloud, ‘ Antiphilus, son of
Deinomenes,” he would not for a long time have
known which was he, so greatly had he been changed
by his dire straits. But Antiphilus, hearing his
voice, cried out; and, as Demetrius approached,
he parted his long hair, all unkempt and matted,
drew it away from his face, and so disclosed his
identity. At once both fell in a faint at the
unexpected sight.
After a time Demetrius brought both himself and
Antiphilus to their senses, and ascertained from him
definitely how everything stood. Then he bade him
have no fear, and tearing his short cloak in two, put

on one of the halves himself and gave the remainder
to Antiphilus, after stripping from him the filthy,
worn-out rags that he was wearing. From that time
forth, too, he shared his life in every way, attending
and cherishing him; for by hiring himself out to the
shipmen in the harbour from early morning until
noon, he earned a good deal of money as a stevedore.
Then, on returning from his work, he would give part
of his pay to the keeper, thus rendering him tractable
and peaceful, and the rest sufficed well enough for
the maintenance of his friend. Each afternoon he
remained with Antiphilus, keeping him in heart;
and when night overtook him, he ‘sept just in front
of the prison door, where he had made a place to lie
and had put down some leaves.
For some time they carried on in this way, Deme-
trius coming in without hindrance and Antiphilus
bearing his misfortune more lightly. But later, after
a certain brigand had died in the prison (by poison,
it was thought) a close guard was instituted, and not
one of those who sought admission could enter the
gaol any longer. Perplexed and distressed over this
situation, as he had no other way to be with his
comrade, he went to the governor and incriminated
himself, alleging that he had been an accomplice in
the attempt upon Anubis.
When he had made that statement, he was haled
straight to prison, and on being brought in with
Antiphilus, he managed with difficulty, by dint of
urgent entreaties addressed to the warden, to obtain
from him one concession, at least—that of being
confined near Antiphilus and in the same set of irons.
Then indeed, more than any other time, he displayed
the affection which he had for him, neglecting his own

adversities (though he himself had fallen ill) but
taking care that Antiphilus should sleep as well as
possible and should suffer less distress. So they bore
their discomforts more easily by sharing them with
each other.
In time an accident occurred which relieved them
from further misfortune. One of the men in irons,
having somehow obtained possession of a file and
enlisted many of the prisoners in a plot, cut the chain
to which they were all attached in a row, with their
fetters strung upon it, and so set them allfree ; where-
upon they easily killed the guards, who were few, and
escaped together. Well, those others scattered at
once, going wherever each one of them could, and
afterwards were arrested, most of them. Demetrius
and Antiphilus, however, remained where they were,
and seized Syrus just as he was about to go. When
daylight came, as soon as the prefect of Egypt
learned what had happened, hesent men tohunt down
the others, but summoned Demetrius and his friend
and freed them from imprisonment, praising them
because they alone did not run away.
They were not the men, however, to be content
with being released in that way. Demetrius cried
out and made a great stir, saying that grave injustice
was being done them, since it would be thought that
they were criminals, and were being released by way
of mercy or commendation because they had not run
away; and at length they forced the magistrate to
undertake an accurate investigation of the affair.
When he discovered that they were not guilty, he
commended them, expressing very great admiration
for Demetrius, and in dismissing them condoled with
them over the punishment which they had undergone

through their unjust imprisonment and presented
each of them with a gift out of his own pocket,
Antiphilus with ten thousand drachmas and Deme-
trius with twice as much.
Antiphilus is still in Egypt, but Demetrius left his
own twenty thousand to his friend and went away to
India, to join the Brahmans, merely saying to Anti-
philus that he might fairly be held excusable for
leaving him now; for he himself would not want the
money as long as he remained what he was, able to
content himself with little, and Antiphilus would not
need a friend any longer, since his circumstances had
become easy.
That, Toxaris, is what Greek friends are like. If
you had not previously calumniated us as priding
ourselves greatly upon words, I should have repeated
for you the very speech, a long one and a good one,
that Demetrius made in the court-room, not defend-
ing himself at all but only Antiphilus; weeping,
moreover, and imploring, and taking the whole thing
upon himself until Syrus under the lash exonerated
both of them.
T have told you these few instances out of a greater
number (the first that my memory supplied), of
friends that were good and true; and now, dismount-
ing from my steed, I yield the word henceforth to
you. How you are to make out that your Scythians
are not worse, but much better than these men, will
be your own look-out, if you are at all concerned
about your right hand, for fear of having it cut off.
But you must show yourself a man of prowess, for
you would put yourself in a laughable position if,

Pylades, you should reveal yourself a poor spokesman
on behalf of Scythia.
TOXARIS
Well done, Mnesippus! You are giving me
- encouragement for my speech, as if it did not matter
at all to you whether you get the worst of it in our
dispute and have your tongue docked. However, I
shall begin at once, without any display of fine words
such as you have made; for that is not a Scythian
habit, especially when the deeds speak louder than
the words. And do not expect from us anything like
what you told of when you commended a man if he
married an ugly wife without a dowry, or if he gave
money to the amount of two talents to the daughter
of 'a friend on her marriage, or even, by Zeus, if he
allowed himself to be imprisoned when it was obvious
that he would soon be released; for those are very
paltry matters, and there is nothing of greatness or
bravery in them. I shall tell you of many deeds of
blood and battles and deaths for the sake of friends,
that you may know the achievements of your people
to be child’s play in comparison with those of the
Scythians.
Yet it is not unaccountable that this is so with you
Greeks, but natural for you to praise these trivial
matters; for you lack, you entirely lack momentous
occasions for the display, of friendship, living as you do
in profound peace. Just so in calm weather a
man cannot tell whether his sailing-master is good ;
hé will need a storm to determine that. With us,
however, wars are continuous, and we are always
either invading the territory of others, or with-
drawing before invaders, or meeting in battle over

pasturage or stolen cattle, where need for good
friends is greatest; and for that reason we cement
our friendships as strongly as we can, thinking this
to be the only irresistible and unconquerable weapon
of war.
First of all, I wish to tell you how we make our
friends. Not through boon-companionship, as you
do, nor because a man has been a comrade of ours
in military training or a neighbour. No, when we
see a brave man, capable of great achievements, we
all make after him, and we think fit to behave in
forming friendships as you do in seeking brides, pay-
ing them protracted court and doing everything in
their company to the end that we may not fall short
of attaining their friendship or be thought to deserve
rejection. And whena man has been singled out and
is at last a friend, there ensue formal compacts and the
most solemn of oaths that we will not only live with
one another but die, if need be, for each other; and
we do just that. For, once we have cut our fingers,
let the blood drip into a cup, dipped our sword-points
into it, and then, both at once, have set it to our
lips and drunk, there is nothing thereafter that can
dissolve the bond between us.!_ We are permitted
at most to enter into three such compacts, since a
man of many friends resembles, we think, promis-
cuous women with their lovers, and we consider
that his friendship is no longer of the same strength
when it has been split up into a multitude of
loyalties.
I shall begin with the affair of Dandamis, which
time, which is proved by a gold plaque from the tomb of
Kul-Oba near Kertch (often reproduced; e.g., Minns, Scythians
and Greeks, p. 203), where a drinking horn is used.

happened recently. In our engagement with the
Sauromatae, when Amizoces had been taken
prisoner, his friend Dandamis—but stay! first let
me take my oath for you in our way, since that also
was part of the agreement that I made with you in
the beginning. I swear by Wind and Glaive that I
shall tell you no falsehood, Mnesippus, about Scythian
friends.
MNESIPPUS
I scarcely felt the need of your swearing, but you
did well to avoid taking oath by any god!
TOXARIS
What is that you say? Do you not think Wind
and Glaive are gods? Were you really so unaware
that there is nothing more important to mankind
than life and death? Well then, when we swear by
Wind and Glaive, we do so because the wind is the
source of life, and the glaive the cause of death.1
MNESIPPUS
Well, really, if that is the reason, you could have
many other such gods as Glaive is—Arrow, Spear,
Poison, Halter, and the like; for this god Death takes
many shapes and puts at our disposal an infinite
number of roads that lead to him.
TOXARIS
Don’t you see how it smacks of sophists bickering
and lawyers in court for you to act this way, interrupt-
ing and spoiling my story? I kept still while you
were talking.
1 Herodotus alludes to Scythian sword-worship (IV, 62),
but says nothing of their worshipping the wind, which
Rostovtzeff takes to be an invention of Lucian’s.

MNESIPPUS
I won’t do it again, anyhow, Toxaris, for you were
quite right in your reproof. Therefore, you may
proceed confidently, as if I were not even here while
you are talking, so silent shall I be for you.
TOXARIS
The friendship of Dandamis and Amizoces was three
days old, counting from the time when they drank
each other’s blood, when the Sauromatae descended
upon our country with ten thousand horse ; and the
foot came over the border, it was said, in thrice that
number. As our people had not foreseen their
attack, they not only routed us completely when they
fell upon us, but slew many of the fighting men and
took the rest prisoners, except one or another who
succeeded in swimming over to the other side of the
river, where we had half our encampment and part
of the wagons; for that was the way in which we
had pitched our tents at the time, since for some
reason unknown to me it had seemed good to the
leaders of our horde—on both banks of the Tanais.!
At once they began to round up the cattle, secure
the prisoners, plunder the tents, and seize the
wagons, taking most of them with all their occupants
and offering violence to our concubines and wives
before our very eyes; and we were distressed over
the situation. But as Amizoces was being dragged
away—for he had been taken—he called upon his
friend by name because of his disgraceful captivity
1 This dates the tale’s origin at a time when the Scythians
and the Sauromatae, or Sarmatians, faced each other on
opposite’sides of the Don, as Rostovtzeff has pointed out.

and reminded him of the cup and the blood. When
Dandamis heard that, without an instant’s hesitation,
under the eyes of everyone he swam over to the
enemy. The Sauromatae rushed at him with
brandished javelins, intending to spear him to death,
but he called out “ Zirin.”” If anyone says that, he is
not killed by them, but is received as coming to offer
ransom.
On being brought up to the leader, he demanded
his friend back, but the man asked for ransom;
he would not let him go, he said, unless he got a great
deal for him. Dandamis replied: ‘“ All that I had
has been carried off by your people; but if in any way
I can make payment as I stand, I am ready to proffer
it to you. Lay on me whatever command you will;
if you like, take me in his place and use me as you
please.” The Sauromatian answered: ‘‘ There is
no need for you to put yourself completely in our
power, especially when you come as Zirin; pay part
of what you possess, and take away your friend.”
Dandamis asked what he would have; whereupon
the other demanded his eyes, and at once he allowed
them to be put out. When that had been done
and the Sauromatae had their ransom, taking Ami-
zoces, he set off for home leaning upon him, and
by. swimming across together they got back to us in
safety.
This occurrence heartened all the Scythians, and
they no longer thought themselves beaten, seeing
1 It is clear from the use of the word Zirin below that it
does not mean “ransom” or ‘“‘ransomer,”’ and cannot be
connected with late Persian Zer, ‘‘ gold,” as Vasmer suggests
(Iranier in Siidrussland, p. 39). It must denote something
like “‘ brother,” “‘ friend,”’ “envoy.”

that the greatest of all our treasures had not been
carried off by the enemy, but we still had among us
staunch resolution and loyalty to friends. Further-
more, the Sauromatae were daunted more than a
little by that same thing, when they considered what
manner of men they were about to face in pitched
battle, even though in the surprise attack for the
moment they had obtained the upper hand. So
when night had fallen, abandoning most of the flocks
and herds and firing the wagons, they vanished in
flight. Amizoces, however, could not bear to have
‘his own sight when Dandamis was blind, but put out
his eyes with his own hands; and now both of them
sit idle, maintained with every show of honour at
public expense by the Scythian folk.
What similar deed, Mnesippus, could you mention,
even if you were allowed to enumerate ten more
instances over and above your five, unsupported
by oath, if you liked, so that you might adorn them
with plenty of fiction? Then too, I have told you the
naked facts; but if you were describing anyone
like that, I know very well how many embellish-
ments you would intersperse in the story, tellin;
how Dandamis pleaded, how he was blinded, what he
said, how he returned, how he was received with
laudation by the Scythians, and other matters such as
you Greeks are in the habit of manufacturing to
gratify your hearers.
But let me tell you about another man equally
honoured, Belitta, cousin of that same Amizoces.
He saw that his friend Basthes had been dragged
_ off his horse by a lion (it chanced that they were
hunting together), and already the lion, lying upon
him, had fastened upon his throat and was tearing him

2K. G. P. Schwartz proposed setting this sentence after
the one that here, as in the MSS., follows it. That would
indeed greatly improve the sequence of thought, but is highly
unsatisfactory from the palaeographical standpoint. The
disturbance is probably a consequence of the abridgement
to which Lucian subjected the story.

with his claws. Springing to the ground, he attacked
the animal from behind and tried to draw him away,
provoking him, diverting his attention, inserting
his fingers between his teeth, and endeavouring in
every possible way to extract Basthes from the grip
of his jaws, until at last the lion left Basthes half-
dead and turning upon Belitta, seized and killed him.
In dying, however, he at least succeeded in stabbing
the lion in the breast with his sword, so that they all
died together, and in burying them we made two
barrows in close proximity, one for the friends and
one facing it for the lion.1
The third friendship of which I shall tell you,
Mnesippus, is that of Macentes, Lonchates, and
Arsacomas. This Arsacomas fell in love with
Mazaea, the daughter of Leucanor, who had become
king in Bosporus,? when he was there on a mission
regarding the tribute which is regularly paid us by
the people of Bosporus but at that time was more
than two months overdue. Well, at the banquet
he caught sight of Mazaea, a tall and beautiful
girl, instantly fell in love with her and was hard hit.
The matter of the contributions had been settled
1 This tale, with its lion (in South Russia, about a.p. 150!)
and the poetic justice of the animal’s entombment, distinctly
suggests a literary source, perhaps an epigram.
2 History knows no king of Bosporus named Leucanor,
nor any Eubiotus, set down below as his illegitimate brother
and successor (§ 51). In a fragment of a Greek romance,
however, of which the plot is laid in Scythia (Papiri della
Societa Italiana, VIII, 981) there is a character, evidently a
ruler, named Eubiotus, and Rostovtzeff points to this as
evidence that Lucian’s tale, itself a miniature romance, is
drawn. from some historical novel (Skythien und der Bosporus,
p. 98). I have noted in it several passages which seem to be
abridgements of a more detailed story.

already, and the king was giving him audience and
entertaining him in connection with his dismissal.
It is customary, however, in Bosporus for suitors to
bespeak brides at dinner and tell who they are that
they should think themselves worthy of acceptance,
and at this time it chanced that many of them were
at the banquet, kings and the sons of kings; Tigra-
pates the dynast of the Lazi was there, and Adyrma-
chus, the ruler of Machlyene, and many others.
Each of the suitors, after announcing that he has
come to propose, must then take dinner, lying in his
place among the others, in silence; but when they
have finished dinner, he must call for a goblet of
wine, pour a drink-offering upon the table, and sue
for the girl’s hand, commending himself freely
according to his standing in family or wealth or
power.
Many, therefore, in accordance with this usage
had poured their libation, made their request, and
enumerated their kingdoms and treasures. Then,
last of all, Arsacomas asked for the cup. He did not
make libation, for it is not our custom to pour out our
wine; on the contrary, we hold that to be an offence
to the god. Instead, he drank it out at a single
draught, and said: ‘‘ O King, give me your daughter
Mazaea for my wife, since I am a much better match
than these men, at least in point of wealth and
property.”” Leucanor was surprised, for he knew that
Arsacomas was poor and just an ordinary Scythian,
and he asked: “‘ How many cattle and how many
wagons have you, Arsacomas, since they constitute
the wealth of your people?” “ Why,’ said he,
““T own no wagons or herds, but I have two noble
friends, such as no other Scythian has.”

Well, at the time they laughed at him on account
of this remark and ignored him, thinking that he
was drunk; Adyrmachus was preferred, and in the
morning was to take away his bride along Lake
Maeotis to the Machlyans. But Arsacomas returned
home and informed his friends how he had been dis-
honoured by the king and laughed at in the banquet
because he was considered poor. “ And yet,” said
he, “I told him what riches I possess in you two,
Lonchates and Macentes, and that your devotion
was better and more lasting than sovereignty over
the people of Bosporus. But in spite of my saying
this, he ridiculed and contemned us, and gave the
maiden to Adyrmachus the Machlyan to take away,
because he was said to own ten golden goblets,
eighty four-bunk wagons, and many sheep and
cattle. So far above brave men did he value great
flocks and herds, artistic drinking-cups, and heavy
wagons.
“ Now for my part, my friends, I am doubly dis-
tressed, for not only do I love Mazaea but this
insult in the presence of so many men has affected
me deeply. And I think that you also have been
equally injured, for a third of the disgrace belonged
to each of us, since we live in the understanding
that from the time when we came together we have
been but as one man, distressed by the same things,
pleased by the same things.” “ Not only that,”
Lonchates added, “‘ but each of us is completely
disgraced in your suffering such treatment.”
“How, then, shall we handle the situation?”
said Macentes. “‘ Let us divide the task between

us,” Lonchates replied; ‘“ I engage to bring Arsa-
comas the head of Leucanor, and you must fetch
his bride home to him.” ‘‘ Very well,” said the
other; “and in the meantime, Arsacomas, as it is
likely that we shall presently need to take the field
and go to war, you, awaiting us here, should collect
and make ready arms, horses, and a very large force.
You might very easily enlist many, since you your-
self are brave and we have plenty of relatives, and
it would be especially easy if you should sit on the
ox-hide.” Those plans were approved, and Lon-
chates, just as he was, made straight for Bosporus,
while Macentes headed for the Machlyans, both of
them mounted. Arsacomas, remaining at home,
held conferences with his comrades and armed a
force recruited from his relatives; then at last he
sat upon the hide.
Our custom in the matter of the hide is as follows.
When a man who has been wronged by another wishes
to avenge himself but sees that by himself he is not
strong enough, he sacrifices a bull, cuts up and cooks
the meat, spreads the hide out on the ground, and
sits on it, with his hands held behind his back like a
man bound by the elbows. That is our strongest
appeal for aid. The meat of the bull is served up,
and as the man’s kinsmen and all else who wish
approach, each takes a portion of it, and then, set-
ting his right foot upon the hide, makes a pledge
according to his ability, one that he will furnish five
horsemen to serve without rations or pay, another
ten, another still more, another foot-soldiers, heavy-

1 Lucian is our only authority for this curious custom;
the allusions to it in Suidas and the paroemiographi (Gaisford,
Bodl. 355, Coisl. 207; Leutech, Append. II, 80, Apostol.

armed or light-armed, as many as he can, and another
simply himself, if he is very poor. So a very large
force is sometimes raised on the hide, and such an
army is especially dependable as regards holding
together and very hard for the enemy to conquer,
since it is under oath; for setting foot on the hide
is an oath.1
Arsacomas, then, was thus engaged; and he raised
some five thousand horse and twenty thousand foot,
heavy-armed and light-armed together. Lonchates
in the meantime entered Bosporus unrecognised,
approached the king while he was attending to a
matter of government, and said that he came with
a message from the Scythian commonwealth, but
also in his private capacity brought him important
news. When he was bidden to speak, he said:
‘The Scythians make one of their ordinary, every-da’
requests, that your herdsmen shall not encroac
upon the plain but shall graze only as far as the stony
ground; and they say that the cattle-lifters whom
you charge with overrunning your country are not
sent out by order of the state but steal for profit,
each on his own account; if any one of them should
be captured, you have full authority to punish
him. That is their message. But on my own part, I
give you notice that a great attack upon you is
about to be made by Arsacomas, the son of
VI, 765) are mere quotations from Lucian, and Gilbert
Cognatus’ mysterious reference to “‘ Zenodotus” and “‘ the
ox of the Homolotti” derives (by way of Erasmus, Adagia:
“‘Bos Homolottorum”’) from Zenobius, II, 83: Bots 6 Modor-
trav! That the Molossian custom of cutting up (but not eating)
an ox in connection with making treaties has nothing to do
with the Scythian usage is clear from the more detailed
explanation of it in Coisl. 57 (Gaisford, p. 126).

Mariantes, who came to you recently on a mission,
and—no doubt because he asked you for your
daughter and did not obtain his request from you—
is incensed; he has been sitting on the hide for six
days now,! and has collected a great host.”
‘I myself,’ said Leucanor, ‘‘ had heard that a
force was being raised on the hide, but did not know
that it is being formed against us or that Arsacomas
is the organiser of it.” ‘‘ Why,” said Lonchates,
“the preparations are directed at youin person. But
Arsacomas is no friend of mine, bearing a grudge
against me because I am held in higher regard by
our dignitaries and considered in all respects a
better man. If you will promise me your other
daughter, Barcetis, since even on other grounds I am
not unworthy of alliance with you, before lon
I will come and bring you his head.”’ “I promise,”
said the king, who had become thoroughly alarmed
because he recognised the just ground for the anger
of Arsacomas in connection with his proposal of
marriage; and besides, he stood in perpetual dread
of the Scythians.
Lonchates replied: ‘“‘ Swear that you will keep the
agreement, and will not go back on your word then,
when the thing is done.”” When the king lifted his
hands toward Heaven and was in purpose to swear,
the other said: ‘‘ Not here, for fear that some
onlooker may suspect the reason of our oath. No,
let us enter the sanctuary of Ares yonder and lock
the doors before we swear; and let nobody hear us!
1 It should not be inferred that it has taken Lonchates
all this time to reach the city and its king. As the king
has heard of the Scythian mustering before Lonchates sees
him, it is evident that there was some delay, whether accidental
or deliberate,

If Arsacomas should get any knowledge of this,
T am afraid that he may initiate the war by making
a victim of me, as he is already surrounded by a
large band.” “Let us enter,’ responded the
king. ‘Gentlemen, withdraw as far as possible,
and let no one present himself in the temple who
is not summoned by me.”
When they had entered and the guardsmen had
withdrawn, Lonchates drew his sword, clapped one
hand over the king’s mouth, that he might not
cry out, and stabbed him in the breast. Then
he cut off his head and carried it out (ith him under
his cloak, keeping up, as he did so, a pretended
conversation with him and saying that he would
return speedily, as if he had been sent by the king
to fetch something. Getting in this way to the place
where he had left his horse tied, he mounted and
rode off to Scythia. There was no pursuit of him,
since the Bosporans remained long in ignorance of
what had happened, and when they did find out
about it, they fell to squabbling over the throne.
That, then, is what Lonchates did, and so ful-
filled his promise to Arsacomas by giving him the
head of Leucanor. As for Macentes, while on his
way he had heard what had happened in Bosporus,
and. when he reached the Machlyans was the first
to report to them the tidings of the king’s death,1
adding: “ And the city, Adyrmachus, calls you to
the throne, as his son-in-law; so you yourself must
ride on ahead and take over the government, appear-
week or more (p. 183 and note) has elapsed before Macentes
reaches the Machlyans, yet he returns in less than forty-eight
hours, riding night and day, to be sure, but with the horse
earrying double and therefore obliged to rest frequently.

ing suddenly in the midst of things while they are
unsettled; but the girl must follow you in your wagon-
train, for in that way it will be easier for you to win
over the common people in Bosporus, after they have
seen the daughter of Leucanor. For myself, I am
an Alan, and also related to the girl through her
mother, since Masteira, whom Leucanor married,
was of our people; and I come to you now on the
part of Masteira’s brothers in the country of the
Alans, who urge you to ride with all speed to Bosporus
and not to let the government go over to Eubiotus,
who being the illegitimate brother of Leucanor, is
always friendly to the Scythians and detests the
Alans.” 4
Macentes was able to say this because he wore the
same dress and spoke the same tongue as the Alans.
These characteristics are common to Alans and
Scythians, except that the Alans do not wear their
hair very long, as the Scythians do. Macentes, how-
ever, had made himself resemble them in this also,
and had docked his hair by as much as an Alan’s
would probably be shorter than a Scythian’s.
Therefore he was believed, and was thought to be a
relative of Masteira and Mazaea.
“* Now then, Adyrmachus,” said he, “ I am ready
to ride with you to Bosporus, if you wish, or to remain,
if necessary, and conduct the girl.” ‘‘ That,” said
Adyrmachus, “is what I should like better—that
as you are of her blood, you should conduct Mazaea.
For if you go with us to Bosporus, we should gain
itself adequately account for his attitude toward the Scythians
and the Alans. Was his mother a Scythian, or perhaps a
Sarmatian? At this time he is living among the Sarmatians
(§ 54).

1 Macentes comes alone; this single horseman is therefore
presumably a Machlyan, and hostile. What, then, becomes
of him? Only implications enlighten us. For some reason
Macentes does not do the obvious thing—kill him at night

<note type="head">TOXARIS, OR FRIENDSHIP</head>
but a single horseman; but if you should conduct
my wife, you would be as good as many.”
That was put into effect, and he rode off, leaving
it to Macentes to conduct Mazaea, who was still a
maid. And he did indeed escort her upon her
wagon during the day; but when night overtook
them, he set her upon his horse—he had seen to it
that only one other horseman should attend them !—
himself leaped to his seat, and instead of continuing
to ride along the shore of Lake Maecotis, turned off
into the interior, taking on his right the mountains
of the Mitraeans. Stopping only at intervals to
allow the girl to rest, on the third day he succeeded
in reaching Scythia from Machlyene; his horse,
on ceasing to run, stood still for a moment and fell
dead, while Macentes, delivering Mazaea to Arsa-
comas, said: “ Accept from me also the fulfilment
of my promise! ”
Arsacomas was amazed at the unexpectedness
of that sight, and tried to express his gratitude,
but Macentes said: “‘ Stop making me a different
person from yourself! To express gratitude to me
for what I have done in this is just as if my left hand
should be grateful to my right for ministering to it
when it had been wounded and taking care of it
fondly while it was weak. So with us—it would be
ridiculous if, after having fused ourselves together
long ago and united, as far as we could, into a
single person, we should continue to think it a
great thing if this or that part of us has done some-
thing useful in behalf of the whole body; for it
and take his horse. Either he eludes them, or they elude
him; and instead of following them, he posts ahead to over-
take Adyrmachus with the news (§ 54).

was working in its own behalf as a part of the whole
organism to which the good was being done.”
This, then, was the reply of Macentes to Arsacomas
when he expressed his gratitude. But when Adyrma-
chus heard of the stratagem, instead of going on to
Bosporus, inasmuch as Eubiotus had been sum-
moned from the Sauromatae, with whom he was
living, and was already on the throne, he returned
to his own country, and after assembling a great
army, advanced through the hill-country into
Scythia. Eubiotus, too, presently made an incursion
with his Greeks in full force and allied levies of
Alans and Sauromatae numbering twenty thousand
from each. After Eubiotus and Adyrmachus had
combined their armies, they amounted in all to
ninety thousand, a third of them mounted archers.
For our part (and I say our, because I myself took
part in their expedition, having offered on the hide
at that time a hundred self-supporting horsemen)
we had raised not much less than thirty thousand,
including the horsemen, and were awaiting their
onset; our commander was Arsacomas. When we
saw them coming on, we marched forward to meet
them, sending our horsemen out in advance. After
a long and hard-fought battle, our side in time began
to give ground, the phalanx began to break, and at
last the entire Scythian force was cut in two. One
part began to withdraw, but it was not at all certain
that they were beaten; indeed, their flight was
considered a retreat, for even the Alans did not
venture to pursue them any distance. The other,
smaller part was surrounded by the Alans and
Machlyans, who were hammering it from all sides,
loosing arrows and javelins without stint; so that

those of us who had been surrounded were suffering
severely, and the rank and file were already throwing
away their arms.
Lonchates and Macentes happened to be in this
part, and had already received wounds from fighting
in the front ranks, Lonchates in the thigh with the
spike of a spear-butt, Macentes on the head with an
axe and on the shoulder with a javelin. When
Arsacomas, who was with us others, perceived that,
thinking it would be dreadful if he should go away
and abandon his friends, he put spurs to his horse,
gave a great shout, and charged among the enemy
with uplifted battle-axe, so that the Machlyans
could not even face the fury of his wrath but separ-
ated and allowed him to go through.
He encouraged his friends and rallied all the others,
then rushed at Adyrmachus, struck him at the base
of the neck with his axe, and clove him to the belt.
Upon his fall they gave way—the whole Machlyan
force first, the Alans not long afterwards, and the
Greeks next. So we had the upper hand once
more, and might have pursued them for a long
distance, killing them, if night had not ended the
business.
On the next day men came to us as suppliants
from the enemy and asked us to make friends; the
Bosporans promised to pay us twice as much tribute,
the Machlyans said that they would give hostages,
and the Alans to make up for that attack undertook
to help us by subduing the Sindians, who had re-
volted some time previously. On those terms we
assented, but only after the approval of Arsacomas

Lucian does not say so. It may be noted, too, that although

and Lonchates had been given ;1 and when the treaty
of peace was made, they negotiated the details.
Such are the deeds, Mnesippus, that Scythians
dare to do for their friends.
MNESIPPUS
They are very dramatic, Toxaris, and quite like
fables. May Glaive and Wind, by whom you swore,
be good to me, but really, if one were to disbelieve
them, one would not seem very open to criticism.
TOXARIS
But see to it, my gallant adversary, that your
disbelief is not jealousy! Nevertheless, I am not
the man to let your disbelieving me deter me from
telling you other such deeds that I know to have
been done by Scythians.
MNESIPPUS
Only don’t let them be too protracted, my
excellent friend, and don’t use such an unembarrassed
flow of speech; for as it is, by running hither and
thither through Scythia and Machlyene, and by
going off to Bosporus and then coming back again,
you have taken very liberal advantage of my silence.
TOXARIS
In this too I must obey your dictates; I must
speak briefly so that I shall not have you getting
completely tired out by following me all about with
your attention. No, rather let me tell you how I
myself was assisted by a friend named Sisinnes.
the Sauromatians contributed 20,000 men to the invading
force, we hear nothing of their part either in the battle or in

When I was going away from home to Athens by
reason of my desire for Greek culture, I put in at
Amastris, on the Black Sea; the city is a port of call
for those sailing this way from Scythia, not far distant
from Carambis. I was accompanied by Sisinnes,
who had been my companion from childhood.
After looking out a lodging near the port and trans-
ferring our effects to it from the vessel, we went
shopping, without suspecting any mischief. In
the meantime thieves pried the door open and
carried off everything, so as not to leave even enough
to suffice for that day.
When we returned home and found out what had
happened, we did not think it best to proceed against
the neighbours, who were numerous, or against our
host, fearing that we should be accounted black-
mailers in public opinion if we said that someone
had robbed us of four hundred darics, a great deal
of clothing, some rugs, and all the other things
that we had. So we discussed the situation to see
what we should do, now that we had become
absolutely penniless in a strange country. My
own thought was to plunge my sword into my side
forthwith, and make my exit from life before endur-
ing any unseemly experience under the pressure of
hunger or thirst, but Sisinnes encouraged me and
begged me not to do anything of that sort, for he
himself would discover a means of our having enough
to live on.
That day, therefore, he carried lumber in from the
port and came back with supplies for us which he
had procured with his wages. But the next morn-
ing, while going about in the market-place he saw a
sort of procession, as he put it, of high-spirited,

handsome young men. These had been enrolled
to fight duels for hire and were to settle their combats
on the next day but one. Well, he found out all
about them, and then came to me, saying:
“ Toxaris, you need not call yourself a poor man any
longer; on the day after to-morrow I shall make
you rich,” ,
Those were his words; accordingly, we eked out a
wretched existence during the interval, and when
at length the spectacle began we were there looking
on, for taking me with him on the pretext of going
to see a Greek show that would be enjoyable and
novel, he had brought me to the theatre. We
took our seats, and first we saw wild beasts brought
down with javelins, hunted with dogs, and loosed
upon men in chains—criminals, we conjectured.
Then the gladiators entered, and the herald, bringing
in a tall youth, said that whoever wanted to fight
with that man should come forward, and would
receive ten thousand drachmas in payment for the
encounter. Thereupon Sisinnes arose, and, leaping
down, undertook to fight and requested arms. On
receiving his pay, the ten thousand drachmas, he
promptly put it in my hands, saying: “If I win,
Toxaris, we shall go away together, with all that we
need; but if I fall, bury me and go back to Scythia.”
While I was lamenting over this, he was given
his armour and fastened it on, except that he did
not put on the helmet but took position bareheaded
and fought that way. He himself received the first
wound, an under-cut in the back of the thigh, dealt
with a curved sword, so that blood flowed copiously.
For my part, I was already as good as dead in my
fright. But he waited until his opponent rushed

upon him too confidently; then he stabbed him in
the breast and ran him through, so that on the instant
he fell at his feet. Himself labouring under his
wound, he sat down upon the body and his life
almost left him, but I, running up, revived and in-
spirited him. When at length he was dismissed
as victor, I picked him up and carried him to our
lodgings. After long treatment he survived and still
lives in Scythia, with my sister as his wife; he is
lame, however, from his wound.
That, Mnesippus, did not happen either in
Machlyene or among the Alans, so as to be un-
attested and possible to disbelieve; there are
many Amastrians here who remember the fight of
Sisinnes.
As the fifth, I shall tell you the deed of Abauchas,
and then I shall stop. Once upon a time this man
Abauchas came to the city of the Borysthenites,!
bringing his wife, of whom he was exceptionally
fond, and two children, one of whom, a boy, was a
child in arms, while the other, a girl, was seven
years old. There came with him also a companion
of his, Gyndanes, who was ill of a wound which he
had received on the way from robbers who had
attacked them. In fighting with them he had got a
thrust in the thigh, so that he could not even stand
for the pain of it. During the night, as they slept—
they chanced to be living in an upper story—a great
fire broke out, every avenue of escape was being
cut off, and the flames were encompassing the house
on all sides. At that juncture Abauchas woke up;
abandoning his crying children, shaking off his wife

as she hung upon him and urging her to save herself,
he carried his comrade down and managed to burst
through at a place which the fire had not yet com-
pletely burned away. His wife, carrying the baby,
followed, telling the girl too to come along. Half-
burned, she let the child fall from her arms and
barely leaped through the flames, and with her the
little girl, who also came very near losing her life.
When someone afterwards rebuked Abauchas for
abandoning his wife and children but bringing out
Gyndanes, he said: ‘‘ Why, I can easily have other
children, and it was uncertain whether these would
be good for anything but I could not in a long time
find another friend like Gyndanes, who has given
me abundant proof of his devotion.” 1
T have finished, Mnesippus, the story of these five,
whom I have selected out of many. And now it is
perhaps time to decide which of us is to have either
his tongue or his right hand cut off, as the case may
be. Who, then, will be our judge?
MNESIPPUS
No one at all; for we did not appoint any judge
of the debate. “But do you know what we ought to
do? Since this time we have shot into the void, let
us some other day choose an umpire and in his
presence tell of other friends; then, whichever of us

(Antig. 905-912), and to the wife of Intaphernes by Herodotus
(IIT, 119). We cannot, however, be entirely certain in the
case of Abauchas that it derives from the Herodotean story.
There are parallels from India (in the Ramayana and in the
Jatakas: Hermes, XXVIII, 465) and from Persia: sbid.,
XXIX, 155); cf. also, for modern Syria, A. Goodrich-Freer,

gets beaten shall at that time have his tongue cut off
if it be I, or his right hand if it be you. Or, if that
is crude, inasmuch as you have resolved to extol
friendship and I myself think that men have no
other possession better or nobler than this, why
should not we ourselves make an agreement with
each other to be friends from this instant and remain
so for ever, content that both have won and thereby
have obtained magnificent prizes, since instead of a
single tongue or a single right hand each of us will
get two, and what is more, two pairs of eyes and of
feet; in a word, everything multiplied by two?
For the union of two or three friends is like the
pictures of Geryon that artists exhibit—a man with
six hands and three heads. Indeed, to my mind
Geryon was three persons acting together in all
things, as is right if they are really friends.
TOXARIS
Good! let us do so. _
MNESIPPUS
But let us not feel the need of blood, Toxaris, or
any sword to confirm our friendship. This conversa-
tion of ours just now and the similarity of our ideals
are far more dependable sureties than that cup which
your people drink, since achievements like these
require resolution rather than compulsion, it seems
to me.

<head>THE DANCE<note><p>An encomiastic treatise, set in a frame of dialogue. The
Cynic Crato, who has no manner of use for pantomimic dancing
or those who go to see it, is converted by Lycinus.
In that form of dancing, a dramatic plot was enacted by a
masked and costumed dancer, supported by an actor (p. 271,
n. 3). The dancer’s lines were spoken for him by someone
else. There was also a chorus, and, for accompaniment, the
flute and the syrinx, with various instruments of percussion,
including the ‘‘iron shoe” (p. 285, n. 2). The name pantomime,
denoting properly the dancer, not the dance, and coined in
Italy, according to Lucian (§ 67), is eschewed by Lucian and the
other Atticists, who speak simply of ‘‘ dancers.” Inscriptions
show a cumbrous official designation voicing a claim to affinity
with tragedy (rpaycxijs evpvOpou Kivijcews vmoxpiris, see
L. Robert, Hermes, LXV [1930], 106-122). The art was
sometimes called ‘‘ tragic’ dancing (Athen., I, 20), but not
by Lucian, who, moreover, does not let himself in for the
error that it was invented by Bathyllus and Pylades (Athen.,
l.c.; Zosimus, I, 6), but represents only that it began to
attain perfection under Augustus.</p>
<p>Vastly popular, it invited notice from rhetoricians as well
as philosophers. Aristides issued an invective against it,
now lost, but in good part recoverable from quotations in the
reply of Libanius (cf. Mesk, Wiener Studien, XXX [1908],
59-74). Lucian knew the book of Aristides, then quite
new, but elected not to reply to it directly. His dialogue was
probably written, as D. S. Robertson has indicated, at Antioch
in 162-165 a.p., when the Emperor Verus was there, in
compliment to him because of his interest in dancers (Essays
and Studies presented to William Ridgeway, p. 180; cf. L.
Robert, sited above). The treatment is on traditional lines,
especially in respect of its emphasis upon gods, heroes, and
nations who have practised or patronized the art, and poets
and philosophers who have sanctioned it; compare, for
instance, The Parasite, and Astrology. It is not meant to be
taken too seriously, in this part above all.</p></note></head>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="1"><p>


LYCINUS
WELL, Crato, this is a truly forceful indictment
that you have brought, after long preparation, I
take it, against dances and the dancer’s art itself,
and besides against us who like to see that sort of
show, accusing us of displaying great interest in
something unworthy and effeminate ; but now let me
tell you how far you have missed the mark and
how blind you have been to the fact that you were
indicting the greatest of all the good things in life.
For that I can excuse you if, having been wedded to
a rude creed from the first and considering only
what is hard to be good, through unacquaintance
with it all you have thought that it deserved indicting.
CRATO
Who that is a man at all, a life-long friend of letters,
moreover, and moderately conversant with philo-
sophy, abandons his interest, Lycinus, in all that
is better and his association with the ancients to sit
enthralled by the flute, watching a girlish fellow play
the wanton with dainty clothing and bawdy songs and
imitate love-sick minxes, the most erotic of all
antiquity, such as Phaedra and Parthenope and

Rhodope,! every bit of this, moreover, accompanied
by strumming and tootling and tapping of feet ??
—a ridiculous business in all truth, which does
not in the least become a freeborn gentleman
of your sort. So for my part, when I learned that
you give your time to such spectacles, I was not
only ashamed on your account but sorely distressed
that you should sit there oblivious of Plato and
Chrysippus and Aristotle, getting treated like people
who have themselves tickled in the ear with a feather,
and that too when there are countless other things
to hear and see that are worth while, if one wants
them—flute-players who accompany cyclic choruses,
singers of conventional compositions for the lyre, and
in especial, grand tragedy and comedy, the gayest
of the gay ; all these have even been held worthy to
figure in competitions.
“You will need, therefore, to do a great deal of
pleading in your own defence, my fine fellow, when
you confront the enlightened, if you wish to avoid
being eliminated absolutely and expelled from the
fold of the serious-minded. And yet the better course
for you, I suppose, is to mend the whole matter b
pleading not guilty and not admitting at all that you
have committed any such misdemeanour. Anyhow,
keep an eye to the future and see to it that you do
not surprise us by changing from the man that you
were of old to a Lyde or a Bacche. That would be
a reproach not only to you but to us, unless, follow-

ing the example of Odysseus, we can pull you away
from your lotus and fetch you back to your wonted
pursuits before you unwittingly fall quite under the
spell of these Sirens in the theatre. But those other
Sirens assailed only the ears, so that wax alone was
needed for sailing past them; you, however, seem
to have been subjugated from top to toe, through
the eyes as well as the ears.
LYCINUS
Heavens, Crato, what sharp teeth there are in this
dog of yours that you have let loose on us! But as
for your parallel, the simile of the Lotus-Eaters
and the Sirens, it seems to me quite unlike what I
have been through, since in the case of those who
tasted the lotus and heard the Sirens, death was
the penalty for their eating and listening, while in
my case not only is the pleasure more exquisite
by a great deal but the outcome is happy; I am not
altered into forgetfulness of things at home or
ignorance of my own concerns, but—if I may speak
my mind without any hesitancy—I have come back
to you from the theatre with far more wisdom and
more insight into life. Or rather, I may well put it
just as Homer does: he who has seen this spectacle
“* Goes on his way diverted and knowing more than
aforetime.”’ +
CRATO
Heracles, Lycinus! How deeply you have been
affected! You are not even ashamed of it all but
actually seem proud. In fact, that is the worst part of
it: you do not show us any hope of a cure when you
dare to praise what is so shameful and abominable.

Tell me, Crato, do you pass this censure upon
dancing and what goes on in the theatre after having

acquainted with the spectacle, you nevertheless
account it shameful and abominable, as you put it?
If you have seen it, you have put yourself on the same

does not seem unreasonable and overbold when you
denounce things of which you know nothing.

Why, is that what was still in store for me—with
beard so long and hair so grey, to sit in the midst of
a parcel of hussies and a frantic audience like that,
clapping my hands, moreover, and shouting very
unbecoming words of praise to a noxious fellow who
doubles himself up for no useful purpose ?
LYCINUS
This talk is excusable in your case, Crato. But if
you would only take my word for it and just for the

T know very well that you could not endure not to
get ahead of everyone else in taking up an advantage-

have become absolutely infatuated !
LYCINUS
Then are you willing to leave off your abuse, my
friend, and hear me say something about dancing
and about its good points, showing that it brings not
only pleasure but benefit to those who see it; how
much culture and instruction it gives; how it imports
harmony into the souls of its beholders, exercising
them in what is fair to see, entertaining them with
what is good to hear, and displaying to them joint
beauty of soul and body? That it does all this with
the aid of music and rhythm would not be reason to
blame, but rather to praise it.
CRATO
I have little leisure to hear a madman praise his
own ailment, but if you want to flood me with non-

service and lend you my ears, for even without wax
I can avoid hearing rubbish. So now I will hold my
peace for you, and you may say all that you wish
as if nobody at all were listening.
LYCINUS
Good, Crato; that is what I wanted most. You
will very soon find out whether what I am going to
say will strike you as nonsense. First of all, you
appear to me to be quite unaware that this practice
of dancing is not novel, and did not begin yesterday
or the day before, in the days of our grandfathers,
for instance, or in those of their grandfathers. No,

1 That is to say, the Hesiodean, cosmogonic Eros, elder
brother of the Titans, not Aphrodite’s puny boy.
2 The Corybantes, mentioned frequently by Lucian, are
to him male supernatural beings (Timon, 41), alien denizens
of Olympus like Pan, Attis, and Sabazius (Icarom., 27;
cf. Parl. of the Gods, 9), whom Rhea attached to_herself
because they too were crazy; in her orgies, one cuts his arm
with a sword, another runs about madly, another blows the
Phrygian horn, another sounds some instrument of percussion
(Dial. Deor., 12, 1; cf. Tragodopod., 38). He does not ascribe
to them any regular dance, or confuse them with the Curetes,
as others often did.
220

<note type="head">THE DANCE</head>
those historians of dancing who are the most
veracious can tell you that Dance came into being
contemporaneously with the primal origin of the
universe, making her appearance together with
Love—the love that is age-old. In fact, the concord
of the heavenly spheres, the interlacing of the
errant planets with the fixed stars, their rhythmic
agreement and timed harmony, are proofs that
Dance was primordial. Little by little she has
grown in stature and has obtained from time to time
added embellishments, until now she would seem
to have reached the very height of perfection and
to have become a highly diversified, wholly har-
monious, richly musical boon to mankind.
In the beginning, they say, Rhea, charmed with
the art, ordered dances to be performed not only in
‘Phrygia by the Corybantes? but in Crete by the
Curetes, from whose skill she derived uncommon
benefit, since they saved Zeus for her by dancing
about him; Zeus, therefore, might well admit that
he owes them a thank-offering, since it was through
their dancing that he escaped his father’s teeth.
They danced under arms, clashing their swords upon
their shields as they did so and leaping in a frantic,
warlike manner.®
3 This is Lucian’s only mention of the Curetes. His account
of their dance agrees with representations in ancient art
(cf..Kekulé-von Rohden, Archit. rém. Tonreliefe, Pl. 25)
as well as with the description of Lucretius (I1, 629-639),
who had seen it performed by mimic Curetes in the train of
the Great Mother. Lucian’s use of the past tense (jv)
suggests not only that his knowledge of them came from books
but that he thought the dance obsolete. That, however,
can hardly have been the case, for we have now a cletic hymn
invoking (Zeus) Kouros, discovered at Palaecastro in Crete,
which probably belongs to the cult with which the Curetes

<note type="head">THE DANCE</head>
Thereafter, all the doughtiest of the Cretans
practised it energetically and became excellent
dancers, not only the common sort but the men of
princely blood who claimed leadership. For example,
Homer calls Meriones a dancer, not desiring to dis-
credit but to distinguish him; and he was so con-
spicuous and universally known for his dancing that
not only the Greeks but the very Trojans, though
enemies, were aware of this about him. They saw,
I suppose, his lightness and grace in battle, which
he got from the dance. The verses go something
like this :
“ Meriones, in a trice that spear of mine would
have stopped you,
Good as you are at the dance.”’!
Nevertheless, it did not stop him, for as he was well
versed in dancing, it was easy for him, I suppose,
to avoid the javelins they launched at him.
Although I could mention many others among the
heroes who were similarly trained and made an
art of the thing, I consider Neoptolemus sufficient.
Though the son of Achilles, he made a great name for
himself in dancing and contributed to it the variety
which is most beautiful, called Pyrrhic after him;
and upon hearing this about his son, Achilles was
more pleased, I am sure, than over his beauty and
all his prowess. So, though till then Troy had been
were connected, and is a late Imperial copy of an early
Hellenistic text (Diehl, Anth. Lyr. Graeca, II, p. 279). Their
dancing saved Zeus from being discovered and swallowed by
his father Cronus because the clashing of their weapons
drowned his infantine wailing.

1 Since Neoptolemus was also called Pyrrhus, it was
inevitable that the invention of the Pyrrhic dance should be
ascribed to him. According to Archilochus (Fr. 190 Bergk),
he originated it when he danced for joy over killing Eurypylus.
That Achilles was more pleased to hear of this than when
Odysseus told him of his son’s beauty and bravery (Odyssey,
XI, 505-540) is known to us only from Lucian, as also the real
reason for the fall of Troy. Lucian’s persiflage derives especial
point from the fact that by this time the Pyrrhic had become
anything but a war-dance. Athenaeus does not hesitate
to call it Dionysiac (XIV, 6314) and compare it with the
cordax.
2 This statement is decidedly unorthodox. Others say
that the Spartans derived their war-dances from Castor and
224

<note type="head">THE DANCE</head>
impregnable, his skill in dancing took it and tumbled
it to the ground.1
The Spartans, who are considered the bravest
of the Greeks, learned from Pollux and Castor to do
the Caryatic, which is another variety of dance
exhibited at Caryae in Lacedaemon,? and they do
everything with the aid of the Muses, to the extent
of going into battle to the accompaniment of flute
and rhythm and well-timed step in marching;
indeed, the first signal for battle is given to the
Spartans by the flute. That is how they managed
to conquer everybody, with music and rhythm to
lead them.
Even now you may see their young men studying
dancing quite as much as fighting under arms.
When they have stopped sparring and exchanging
blow for blow with each other, their contest ends
in dancing, and a flute-player sits in the middle,
playing them a tune and marking time with his foot,
while they, following one another in line, perform
figures of all sorts in rhythmic step, now those of
Pollux, and that Castor gave them a fine martial tune, the
Kastoreion. It remained for Lucian to ask us to imagine the
horse-tamer and his pugilistic twin, with basket-like contri-
vances on their heads, facing each other demurely and executing
on tip-toe the graceful figures of the dance performed in honour
of Artemis by the maidens of Caryae—the famous Cary-
atides! What these figures looked like is well known to us
from ancient reliefs (cf. G. H. Chase, Loeb Collection of Arretine
Pottery, Pl. III, No. 53, and the Albani relief in F. Weege,
Der Tanz in der Antike, Fig. 52). Sculptural representations
of the Caryatides in their statuesque poses, functioning as
architectural supports, were so frequent that the name was
extended to other similar figures just as it is now when it
is applied to the Attic ‘‘Maidens” of the Erechtheum
porch.

war and presently those of the choral dance, that
are dear to Dionysus and Aphrodite. That is why
the song which they sing while dancing is an invo-
cation of Aphrodite and of the Loves, that they may
join their revel and their dances. The second of the
songs, moreover—for two are sung—even contains
instruction how to dance: “ Set your foot before you,
lads,’”’ it says, ‘‘ and frolic yet more featly,’’1 that is,
dance better.
The same sort of thing is done by those who dance
what is called the String of Beads. That is a dance
of boys and girls together who move in a row and
truly resemble a string of beads. The boy precedes,
doing the steps and postures of young manhood,
and those which later he will use in war, while the
maiden follows, showing how to do the women’s
dance with propriety ; fence the string is beaded
with modesty and with manliness. In like manner
their Bareskin Plays are dancing.”
Taking it that you have read what Homer has to
say about Ariadne in ‘‘ The Shield,” and about the
chorus that Daedalus fashioned for her,? I pass it
by; as also the two dancers whom the poet there
calls tumblers, who lead the chorus, and again what
he says in that same “ Shield” : ‘ Youthful dancers
were circling ’’; which was worked into the shield
by Hephaestus as something especially beautiful.4
And that the Phaeacians should delight in dancing
bs Voey Hele is known about the Spartan ‘‘ Bareskin Plays”
except that they included processional choruses of naked youths
which competed with each other in dancing and singing,
in a place called the Chorus, near the agora.

was very natural, since they were people of refine-
ment and they lived in utter bliss. In fact, Homer
has represented Odysseus as admiring this in them
above all else and watching “ the twinkling of their
feet.”” 1
In Thessaly the cultivation of dancing made such
progress that they used to call their front-rank
men and champions “ fore-dancers.”” This is
demonstrated by the inscriptions upon the statues
which they dedicated in honour of those who showed
prowess in battle. ‘“ The citie,’’ they say, ‘‘ hath
esteemed him fore-dancer;” and again, ‘“ To
Eilation the folk hath sett up thys ymage for that
he danced the bataille well.”’ 2
I forbear to say that not a single ancient mystery-
cult can be found that is without dancing, since they
were established, of course, by Orpheus and Musaeus,
the best dancers of that time, who included it
in their prescriptions as something exceptionally»
beautiful to be initiated with rhythm and dancing.
To prove that this is so, although it behoves me to
observe silence about the rites on account of the
uninitiate, nevertheless there is one thing that
everybody has heard; namely, that those who let
out the mysteries in conversation are commonly
said to “ dance them out.”
At Delos, indeed, even the sacrifices were not
without dancing, but were performed with that
and with music. Choirs of boys came together,
and while they moved and sang to the accompani-
ment of flute and lyre, those who had been selected
from among them as the best performed an interpre-
little likelihood that the soil of Thessaly will ever confirm the
testimony of Lycinus.

1 That the “ hyporchematic ” style of dancing was inter-
pretative, which in Lucian’s description of it is only implicit,
is expressly stated by Athenaeus (I, 15 D).. In previously
Forming to it as ‘‘ dance accompanying song ” (rijv zpos gdqv
aus), he seems to agree with Lucian in the point that its
ormers do not themselves sing. Elsewhere in his work
(XIV, 6310) he gives a definition (from Aristocles) that is
diametrically opposed: ‘‘ when the chorus dances si Bad
But this is connected with a highly theoretical classification

<note type="head">THE DANCE</head>
tative dance. Indeed, the songs that were written
for these choirs were called Hyporchemes (interpre-
tative dances), and lyric poetry is full of them.t
Yet why do I talk to you of the Greeks? Even
the Indians, when they get up in the morning and
pray to the sun, instead of doing as we do, who think
that when we have kissed our hand the prayer is
complete, face the sunrise and welcome the God
of Day with dancing, posturing in silence and imi-
tating the dance of the god; and that, to the Indians,
is prayer and dance and sacrifice all in one. So
they propitiate their god with those rites twice each
day, when it begins and when it declines.
The Ethiopians, moreover, even in waging war,
do it dancing, and an Ethiopian may not let fly the
shaft that he has taken from his head (for they use
the head in place of a quiver, binding the shafts
about it like rays) unless he has first danced, menacing
the enemy by his attitude and terrifying him in
advance by his prancing.?
Since we have spoken of India and of Ethiopia,
it will repay us to make an imaginary descent into
Egypt, their neighbour. For it seems to me that the
ancient myth about Proteus the Egyptian means
nothing else than that he was a dancer, an imitative
of dances under six heads, three of which are dramatic
(tragic, comic, satyric) and three lyric (pyrrhic, gymnopaedio,
ype hematio). was we know that gymnopaedic c
need singing,” it seems pretty clear that the definition of
“ hyporehematic ’» has been incorrectly transmitted in the
text.
a Heliodorus i in the La opica (IX, 19) goes into greater

fellow, able to shape himself and change himself
into anything, so that he could imitate even the
liquidity of water and the sharpness of fire in the
liveliness of his movement; yes, the fierceness of a
lion, the rage of a leopard, the quivering of a tree, and
in a word whatever he wished. Mythology, however,
on taking it over, described his nature in terms more
paradoxical, as if he became what he imitated. Now
just that thing is characteristic of the dancers to-day,
who certainly may be seen changing swiftly at the cue
and imitating Proteus himself. And we must sup-
pose that in Empusa, who changes into countless
forms, some such person has been handed down by
mythology.+
Next in order, it is proper that we should not forget
that Roman dance which the best-born among them,
called Salii (which is the name of a priesthood),
perform in honour of Ares, the most bellicose of the
gods—a dance which is at once very majestic and very
sacred. And a Bithynian story, not very divergent,
moreover, from those current in Italy, says that
Priapus, a warlike deity, one of the Titans, I
suppose, or one of the Idaean Dactyls who made a
business of giving lessons in fencing, had Ares
put into his charge by Hera while Ares was still a
boy, though hard-muscled and immoderately virile ;
and that he did not teach him to handle weapons
until he had made him a perfect dancer. Indeed,
for this he even got a pension from Hera, to receive
1 Empusa, one of Hecate’s associates, used to frighten
people by appearing suddenly out of dark places in one
orrid form or another; she seems to have been par-
ticularly given to manifesting herself with legs like those of
an ass.

1 This Bithynian myth of Priapus is not recorded elsewhere,
but as it is known that Priapus was held in high honour there,
it may well be that he was associated with Ares and that
dances played a part in the cult.

from Ares in perpetuity a tenth of all that accrued
to him in war.?
As to the Dionysiac and Bacchic rites, I expect you
are not waiting for me to tell you that every bit of
them was dancing. In fact, their most typical dances,
which are three in number, the Cordax, the Sicinnis,
and the Emmeleia, were invented by the attendants
of Dionysus, the Satyrs, who named them all after
themselves,? and it was by the exercise of this art,
they say, that Dionysus subdued the Tyrrhenians,
the Indians, and the Lydians, dancing into subjection
with his bands of revellers a multitude so warlike.
Therefore, you amazing fellow, take care that it
isn’t impious to denounce a practice at once divine
and mystic, cultivated by so many gods, performed
in their honour, and affording at once amusement
and profitable instruction in such degree !
Another thing surprises me in you, since I know
that you are a great lover of Homer and Hesiod—I
am going back, you see, to the poets once more—
how you dare contradict them when they praise
dancing above all things else. When Homer
enumerated all that is sweetest and best—sleep,
love, song, and dance *—it was this alone that he
called “ blameless,’”’ and what is more, he ascribes
sweetness to song; but both these things pertain
to the dancer’s art, both dulcet song and blameless
2? The drama belonged to Dionysus, and each form of it
had its typical dance, that of tragedy being the Emmeleia,
that of comedy the Cordax, and that of the satyr-play the
Sicinnis (Ath., I, 208; cf. below, §26). That they were named
from satyrs seems to be Lucian’s own idea, though the
Sicinnis was sometimes said to owe its name to its Cretan or
barbarian inventor.

dancing—which you now take it into your head to
blame! And again, in another part of his poetry : 1
One man getteth from God the gift of achievement
in warfare,
One, the art of the dance, and song that stirreth
the heart-strings.
Singing combined with dancing does in truth stir the
heart-strings, and it is the choicest gift of the gods.
Also, it appears that in classifying all activities
under two heads, war and peace, Homer has set
off against those of war these, and: these only, as
peerless. As for Hesiod, who was not told by
someone else about the dancing of the Muses but
saw it himself at break of day, he begins his poem ?
by saying about them as the highest possible praise
that they ‘‘ dance with delicate footfall about the
violet waters,” circling round the altar of their sire.
In spite of this, my high-spirited friend, you
insult dancing almost to the point of quarrelling
with the wade and yet Socrates (the wisest of
men, if we may believe Apollo, who said so) not
only commended it but wanted to learn it, attributing
the greatest value to observance of rhythm and
music, to harmonious movement and to gracefulness
of limb; and he was not ashamed, aged as he was,
to consider it one of the most important subjects
of study.2 He would, of course, be uncommonly
enthusiastic over dancing, since he did not hesitate
to study even what was trivial, and not only used to
attend the schools of the flute-girls, but did not
2 The Theogony.
3 In the Symposium of Xenophon (II, 15-16) Socrates
commends dancing as an exercise, and expresses a desire to
learn figures that he has just seen. Cf. Diog. Laert., II, 5, 15.

disdain to listen to serious discourse from Aspasia, a
courtesan.1 Yet the art was just beginning when he
saw it then, and had not yet been elaborated to such
a high degree of beauty. If he could see those who
now have advanced it to the utmost, that man, I
am sure, dropping everything else, would have
given his attention to this spectacle alone; and he
would not have had his young friends learn anything
else in preference to it.
Again, it seems to me that when you praise comedy
and tragedy, you have forgotten that in each of them
there is a special form of dance; that is to say, the
tragic is the Emmeleia and the comic the Cordax,
though sometimes a third form, the Sicinnis, is in-
cluded also.? But since at the outset you gave greater
honour to tragedy and comedy and cyclic flute-
players and singing with the lyre than to the dance,
calling these competitive and therefore grand—
come, let us now compare each one of them with the
dance. And yet, suppose we omit the flute, if you
do not mind, and the lyre, since they are parts of the
dancer’s paraphernalia.
As far as tragedy is concerned, let us form our
first opinion of its character from its outward sem-
blance. What a repulsive and at the same time
frightful spectacle is a man tricked out to dispropor-
tionate stature, mounted upon high clogs, wearing
a mask that reaches up above his head, with a mouth
that is set in a vast yawn as if he meant to swallow
up the spectators! I forbear to speak of pads for
1 See Plato, Menexenus, 2358 and 249c; Xen., Oecon.,
II, 14.
2 The Sicinnis, though regarded as the characteristic
dance of the satyr-play, was sometimes presented in comedy.

the breast and pads for the paunch, wherewith he
puts on an adscititious, counterfeit corpulence, so that
the disproportion in height may not betray itself
the more conspicuously in a slender figure. Then
too, inside all this, you have the man himself bawling
out, bending forward and backward, sometimes
actually singing his lines, and (what is surely the
height of unseemliness) melodising his calamities,
holding himself answerable for nothing but his voice,
as everything else has been attended to by the poets,
who lived at some time in the distant past. To be
sure, as long as he is an Andromache or a Hecuba,
his singing can be tolerated; but when he enters
as Heracles in person and warbles a ditty, forgetting
himself and taking no shame either for the lion-skin
that he is wearing or for the club, a man in his right
mind may properly term the thing a solecism.1
And by the way, the charge you were bringing
against the dance, that men imitate women, would
be a common charge against both tragedy and
comedy. Indeed, in them the female parts out-
number the male! Moreover, comedy accounts the
ridiculousness of the masks themselves as part of
what is pleasing in her; for example, the masks of
Davuses and Tibiuses,? and of cooks.
On the other hand, that the appearance of the
dancer is seemly and becoming needs no assertion
on my part, for it is patent to all who are not blind.
His mask itself is most beautiful, and suited to the
drama that forms the theme; its mouth is not wide
open, as with tragedy and comedy, but closed, for
he has many people who do the shouting in his
stead. In the past, to be sure, they themselves
both danced and sang; but afterwards, since the

panting that came of their movement disturbed their
singing, it seemed better that others should accom-
pany them with song.
e themes of tragedy and the dance are common
to both, and there is no difference between those
of the one and those of the other, except that the
themes of the dance are more varied and more un-
hackneyed, and they contain countless vicissitudes.
If the dance does not feature in contests, I maintain
that it is because the governors of the games thought
the thing too important and too grand to be called
into competition. I forbear to mention that a city
in Italy, the fairest that belongs to the Chalcidian
race, has added it, by way of embellishment, to
the games that are held there.
At this point I should like to defend the numerous
omissions in my account, that I may not create an
impression that I lack sense or learning. I am not
unaware that many before our time who have
written about the dance have made it the chief matter
of their essays to enumerate all its forms and list
their names, telling what each is like and by whom
it was discovered, thinking to make a display of wide
learning thereby. But for my own part, first and
foremost, I think that to be zealous about these
things is tasteless, pedantic, and as far as I am con-
cerned, out of place, and for that reason I pass them
over. Besides, I want you to understand and re-
member that the topic which I have proposed for
myself at present is not to give the history of every
form of the dance, and I have not taken it upon
myself as the aim of my discussion to enumerate
American Philological Association, LXVI (1935), especially
n. 19 in regard to the inclusion of pantomimic contests.

names of dances, except for the few that I mentioned
at the outset, in touching upon the more character-
istic of them. No, at present anyhow, the chief
object of my discussion is to praise the dance as
it now exists and to show how much that is pleasur-
able and profitable it comprises in its embrace,
although it did not begin to attain such a height of
beauty in days of old, but in the time of Augustus,
approximately.
Those early forms were roots, so to speak, or
initial stages, of the dance; but the flowering of
it and the consummate fruition, which precisely
at this moment has been brought to the highest
point of perfection—that is what our discussion
treats of, omitting the Tongs and the Crane-dance 2
and so forth as no longer having anything to do with
the dancing of to-day. And as to that “ Phrygian ”’
form of the dance, the one that accompanied wine and
revelry, performed amidst drunkenness, generally
by peasants who executed, to the music of flutes
played by women, violent and trying gambols still
prevalent in the country districts, that too I have
not omitted out of ignorance but because those
gambols have nothing to do with our present dance.
As you know, Plato in the Laws praises certain
forms of the dance, but strongly condemns certain
others, dividing them with reference to what is
1 See Athenaeus I, 20D, where Bathyllus and Pylades are
given as its inventors, on the authority of Aristonicus.
2 The Tongs seems to have involved the performance of
entrechats (Eustathius on Odyss., VIII, p. 1161). The Crane-
dance was said to have been first danced about the altar
at Delos by Theseus and his companions, imitating the escape
from the Labyrinth (Pollux, IV, 101).

pleasurable and profitable and rejecting the more
unseemly sorts, but valuing and admiring the rest.1
About the dance itself, let this suffice; for it would
be tasteless to prolong my discussion by taking up
everything. What qualifications the dancer on his
part ought to have, how he should have been trained,
what he should have studied, and by what means
he should strengthen his work, I shall now set forth
for you, to show you that Dance is not one of the
facile arts that can be plied without pains, but
reaches to the very summit of all culture, not only
in music but in rhythm and metre, and especially
in your own favourite, philosophy, both physics and
ethics. To be sure, Dance accounts philosophy’s
inordinate interest in dialectics inappropriate to
herself. From rhetoric, however, she has not held
aloof, but has her part in that too, inasmuch as
she is given to depicting character and emotion,
of which the orators also are fond. And she has not
kept away from painting and sculpture, but mani-
festly copies above all else the rhythm that is in
them, so that neither Phidias nor Apelles seems at
all superior to her.
Before all else, however, it behoves her to enjoy
the favour of Mnemosyne and her daughter Polymnia,
and she endeavours to remember everything. Like
Calchas in Homer, the dancer must know “ what is,
and what shall be, and was of old,” 2 so thoroughly
that nothing will escape him, but his memory of it
all will be prompt. To be sure, it professes in the
main to be a science of imitation and portrayal, of
revealing what is in the mind and making intelligible

2 The compendium of mythology that follows is notable
not only for its brevity but for its arrangement on geographical
lines, which is unique, and I think was ado: by Lucian
as an aid to memory, since the passage was clearly composed
off-hand and very little retouched. He must have thought
of it not only as displaying his own command of mythology
and knowledge of what Pindar calls ‘‘ the short road” in
story-telling, but as a help to dancers, libretto-writers, and
audiences, and incidentally of interest to the latter as a memory-
test (cf. True Story, 1; The Dead Come to Life, 6; Mistaken
Critic, 6). This is certainly the way in which most of its

what is obscure. What Thucydides said of Pericles
in praising the man would also be the highest possible
commendation of a dancer, “to know what is meet
and express it;’’?! and by expressing I mean the
intelligibility of his postures. But his whole
accoutrement for the work is ancient story, as I
have said, and the prompt recollection and graceful
presentation of it. Beginning with Chaos and the
primal origin of the world, he must know everything
down to the story of Cleopatra the Egyptian.?
Let this be the range we prescribe for the dancer’s
learning, and let him know thoroughly all that lies
within it: the castration of Uranus, the begetting of
Aphrodite, the battle of the Titans, the birth of Zeus,
the stratagem of Rhea, the substitution of the stone,
the fetters of Cronus, the casting of lots among the
three brothers.2 Then, in order, the revolt of the
Giants, the theft of fire, the fashioning of man,‘
the punishment of Prometheus, the power of the two
Erotes;5 and after that, the errancy of Delos, the
readers will want to use it now. Those who, perhaps from
interest in it as a dancer’s repertory, wish to study it and find
the notes given here and the further hints in the Index in-
sufficient to their purpose should make use of Sir J. G. frazer’s
Apollodorus (L.C.L.), which will make it all plain sailing.
3 Zeus, Poseidon, and Hades, for their respective dominions.
4 The allusion is not to the making of Pandora, but to
the legend of the moulding of man out of earth and water by
Prometheus, with the help of Athena, who supplied the
breath of life: see Lucian’s Prometheus, 1, and 11-17; A
Literary Prometheus, 4; and Frazer on Apollodorus I, 7, 1,
to whose references add Callimachus, Fr. 87 and Fr. 133
Schn. (Mair [L.C.L.], pp. 292, 310). It took place at Iconium
in Lycaonia; cf. Stephanus of Byzantium, s.v. Ixdévov.

1 Two eagles let fly by Zeus, one from the east, the other
from the west, met at Delphi; the Navel-stone (Omphalos)
marked the spot, the centre of the earth, and had two eagles
of gold set up by it (Pindar, Pyth., IV, 6, with the scholia;
Frazer, Pausanias, Vol. V, pp. 314-315).
2 Dionysus Zagreus (Sabazius), son of Persephone, was

travail of Leto, the killing of Pytho, the plot of
Tityus, and the discovery of earths’ central point
by the flight of the eagles.1 .
Next comes Deucalion, with the great shipwreck
of life in his time, and the single ark conserving a
remnant of the human race, and men created afresh
from stones. Then the dismemberment of Iacchus,?
the trick of Hera,’ the burning of Semele, the double
birth of Dionysus, the story of Athena and the story
of Hephaestus and Erichthonius, the rivalry for
Attica, Halirrhothius and the first trial on the
Areopagus, and in a word, Attic mythology complete ;
but particularly the wandering of Demeter, the
finding of Core, the visit to Celeus, the husbandry
of Triptolemus; the vine-planting of Icarius, and
the sad fate of Erigone; the story of Boreas, of
Oreithyia, of Theseus and Aegeus. Also, the
reception of Medea and her later flight to Persia,
the daughters of Erechtheus, and the daughters of
Pandion, with what they suffered and did in Thrace.
Then Acamas, Phyllis,‘ the first rape of Helen, the
campaign of the Dioscuri against the city, the fate
3 Inducing Semele to beg Zeus to come to her in all his
majesty.
* The Thracian princess Phyllis hanged herself because her
lover, one of the sons of Theseus, did not return to her. As
the story is usually told, the lover was Demophon (Apoll.,
Epit., vi, 16-17; Ovid, Herotdes, ii). Another version,
however, gave ‘that part to Acamas (Aeschines, II, 31),
and that is probably Lucian’s intention here. But it is also
possible that he expects us to supply from memory the name
of Demophon in connection with that of Phyllis, and to associ-
ate with that of Acamas his affair with Laodice, daughter of
Priam, who came to him self-invited (Lycophron, Alez., 496),
and later, at the fall of Troy, gave him Munitus, the son she
had borne him, and was herself swallowed up by the earth.

of Hippolytus, and the return of the Heracleidae ;
for all this may properly be considered Attic.
These Athenian tales that I have run over are
a very few by way of example out of the many that
have been omitted. And next comes Megara, with
Nisus and Scylia, the purple lock, the expedient of
Minos, and his ingratitude towards his benefactress.1
To these succeed Cithaeron, with all that befell the
Thebans and the house of Labdacus; the advent
of Cadmus, the heifer’s taking ground, the serpent’s
teeth, and the emergence of the Sown Men; further,
the transformation of Cadmus into a serpent, the
rising of the walls to the music of the lyre, the
madness of the wall-builder,? the boastfulness of his
wife Niobe, and her grief-stricken silence, the story
of Pentheus and of Actaeon, the story of Oedipus,
Heracles with all his labours, and the murder of his
children.
Then comes Corinth, also full of myths, since she
has Glauce and Creon, and before them Bellerophon
and Stheneboea, and the quarrel between Helius
and Poseidon;? afterwards, the madness of Athamas,
the flight of the children of Nephele through the
air on the back of the ram, and the reception of Ino
and Melicertes.4
seems to be thinking of it as Minos’ way of carrying out @
revious bargain with Scylla to ‘‘ take her with him,” or the
ike. So Tarpeia bargained with the Sabines for what they
had on their arms, expecting their bracelets; but they crushed
her with their shields.

Next is the story of the descendants of Pelops,
with Mycenae and what happened there, and
previously—Inachus, Io, and her warder Argus;
Atreus, Thyestes, Aerope, and the golden lamb;
the defloration of Pelopeia; 1 the slaying of Agamem-
non, and the punishment of Clytemestra. Even
before that, the expedition of the Seven Captains,
with Adrastus’ reception of the exiles who became
his sons-in-law, and the oracle about them,? the
refusal to bury the fallen, and the death of Antigone
and Menoeceus on that account. Also what hap-
pened on Nemean soil, the story of Hypsipyle and
Archemorus, is very essential for the dancer to
remember.® And from an earlier time he will know
the enforced virginity of Danae, the birth of Perseus,
and the quest of the Gorgons which he assumed.
Related to this is the Ethiopian tale of Cassiopea,
Andromeda, and Cepheus, who have been placed
in the roll of constellations by the faith of men of
after time. And he will also know that ancient
tale of Aegyptus and Danaus, and the bride-night
plot.
Sparta, too, affords not a few stories of this sort :4
Hyacinthus, and Apollo’s rival, Zephyrus; the lad’s
slaying with the discus, the flower that came from
the blood, and the word of woe (AI) that is written
3 Just why it should be so essential is not very obvious.
The infant Archemorus was killed by a dragon when his nurse
Hypsipyle left him at a spring in order to point out the way
to Thebes to the army of the seven chieftains. But Lucian’s
remark may have been called forth by the thought of Hypsi-
pyle’s earlier history as queen of Lemnos—her killing her hus-
band and saving her father, and her love for Jason.
“ One wonders whether Lucian’s omission of the story of
Leda is careless or intentional.

1 The tale is told by Lucian in Dialogues of the Gods, 16
(14), and there too the scene is laid in Sparta; cf. Apoll.,
III, 10, 3. It figured also among the tales of Northern
Greece (Apoll., I, 3, 3).
8 Dido’s story essentially as it was told in the Greek of
Tinaeus may still be read in the Latin of Justin (XVIII, 4-8);
but Aeneas played no part in it. His introduction into it

on it.1 Also the resurrection of Tyndareus, and
Zeus’s anger at Asclepius over it. Further, the
entertainment of Paris and the rape of Helen, after
his judgement in the matter of the apple. For we
must recognise that there is a connecting bond
between Spartan story and that of Troy, which is
copious and full of parts to play; in fact, for each
person who fell there, a drama offers itself to the
theatre. These themes must be kept in mind above
all others, from the time of the rape straight through
to what happened in the ‘‘ Home-farings,” with
the wandering of Aeneas and the love of Dido.”
The dramas that centre upon Orestes, including
that hero’s adventures in Scythia, are not alien to
all this; and what went before is not incongruous,
either, but akin to the story of Troy—the virgin
life of Achilles in Scyros, the madness of Odysseus,
the marooning of Philoctetes, and, in general,
the whole wandering of Odysseus, including Circe,
Telegonus,? Aeolus’ sway over the winds, and all
the rest of it, to the punishment of the suitors.
Also, preceding this, the plot against Palamedes, and
the wrath of Nauplius, the madness of Ajax, and the
death of the other Ajax among the rocks.
cannot be traced further back than Naevius. It probably
came to Lucian by way of Vergil, from whom, however, it
is hardly likely that he derived it at first hand.
3 Telegonus, the son of Circe and Odysseus, does not appear
in the Odyssey, but was the hero of a late sequel to it, the
Telegony. Its content is reflected in an abstract by Proclus
(Evelyn White, Hesiod, etc. [L.C.L.], p. 530) and in Apoll.,
Epit., VII, 34-37. In stating that its author represented
Telegonus as Odysseus’ son by Calypso, Eustathius is mani-
festly in error, for the part played by Circe in the conclusion
of the story makes it certain that Circe was his mother.

1 Probably the wrestling match between Cronus and Zeus,
by which Zeus won possession of Olympia, is meant here rather
than the games in which the gods competed under the presi-
dency of Zeus (Paus., V, 7, 10), or the wrestling match between
Zeus and Heracles (Lyc., 39-43), or the games held by Heracles,
in which the competitors were his contemporaries (Pindar,
Ol., X, 60-75).

Elis too has many subjects for those who essay
the dance—Oenomaus and Myrtilus, Cronus and
Zeus, and the first contestants in the Olympic games ;1
and the Arcadian mythology also is copious—the
flight of Daphne, the transformation of Callisto
into a wild beast, the drunken riot of the Centaurs,
the birth of Pan, the love of Alpheus, and his journey
into foreign parts beneath the sea.
Indeed, even if you go to Crete in fancy, the dance
garners very many contributions from there—
Europe, Pasiphae, both the bulls,? the labyrinth,
‘Ariadne, Phaedra, Androgeos, Daedalus and Icarus,
Glaucus and the soothsaying skill of Polyidus, and
Talus, the bronze roundsman of Crete. Or if you
cross over to Aetolia, there too the dance finds a
great deal—Althea, Meleager, Atalanta, the brand,
the wrestling-match between Heracles and the river
(Achelous), the birth of the Sirens,? the emergence
of the Echinades,‘ and the settlement of Alemaeon
there after his madness; then Nessus, and the
jealousy of Deianeira, and, consequent upon it,
the pyre in Oeta.
Thrace also has much that is essential to one who
intends to dance—Orpheus, his dismemberment
and his talking head that voyaged on the lyre;5
that dropped from the wound of Achelous, inflicted by Heracles
through breaking off one of his horns (Libanius, Progymn., 4).
4 Five of the Echinades were nymphs, turned into islands
for their failure to invite Achelous to a sacrifice. A sixth,
Perimele, was a maiden who was thrown into the sea by her
father because she had given herself to Achelous; in answer
to Achelous’ prayer, Poseidon changed her into an island.
So, at all events, says Ovid (Met., VIII, 577-610).
5 The story of the head of Orpheus is told by Lucian in
The Ignorant Book-Collector, 11-12 (Vol. III, pp. 188 ff.).

1 Apollonius of Rhodes (III, 616-682) describes at some
length a dream of Medea’s, shortly after the arrival of Jason,
to the effect that he came to win her, that she helped him
with the oxen; that she was chosen to arbitrate the strife
that arose, and decided in Jason’s favour; whereupon her
parents clamoured, and she awoke. Since this dream is
not traditional, its inclusion in Lucian’s list is perhaps to be
explained by assuming that he knew of its actual use as a
pantomimic theme.
260
<pb n="261"/>
<note type="head">THE DANCE</head>
Haemus and Rhodope; the punishment of Lycurgus ;
and Thessaly affords still more—Pelias, Jason,
Alcestis, the expedition of the fifty youths, the Argo
and her talking keel, the incidents at Lemnos,
Aeétes, the dream of Medea,! the dismemberment
of Apsyrtus, the happenings of the cruise, and after
that, Protesilaus and Laodameia.
If you cross the sea again to Asia, there are many
dramas there—Samos, at the outset, with the fate
of Polycrates and his daughter’s wanderings, ex-
tending to Persia,? and the stories that are still
older—the loquaciousness of Tantalus, the feast
of the gods at his house, the butchering of Pelops,
and his shoulder of ivory. ;
In Italy, moreover, we have the Eridanus, and
Phaethon, and the poplars that are his sisters,
mourning and weeping amber. And a man of
the sort I have in mind will know about the
Hesperides, too, and the dragon that guards the
golden fruit, and the toil of Atlas, and about Geryon,
and the lifting of his cattle from Erytheia. And
2 This allusion is puzzling. Nothing about the daughter
of Polycrates is known to us except that she foretold her
father’s death through a dream (Herod., III, 124). Since
Herodotus tells also how Syloson, the brother of Polycrates,
went to Egypt as an exile, earned the gratitude of Darius,
who was serving there as a guardsman, by giving him a cloak
which Darius coveted and sought to buy, and later, after the
death of Polycrates, visited Susa and obtained from Darius
his restoration to Samos and establishment as ruler of the
island, it has been thought that Lucian has been guilty of
confusing the brother with the daughter. But Lucian was a
little too well acquainted with Herodotus (and the world with
the story of Syloson’s cloak) to make this quite credible. A
gap in the text here is easily possible, but it may also be that
Hellenistic imagination gave the daughter a romantic history
which dancers had selected for portrayal.

1 Caeneus and Tiresias are coupled also in Gallus, 19.
On Caeneus, a woman who at her own request was changed by
Poseidon into a man, see especially Sir J. G. Frazer’s note on
Apoll., Epit., I, 22.

he will not fail to know all the fabulous transforma-
tions, the people who have been changed into trees or
beasts or birds, and the women who have turned into
men; Caeneus, I mean, and Tiresias, and their like. .
In Phoenicia he will know about Myrrha? and that
Syrian tale of dissevered woe, as well as the more
recent happenings that followed the establishment
of Macedonian rule, the bold deeds of Antipater
as well as those at the court of Seleucus over
the affections of Stratonice.4 Since Egyptian tales
are somewhat mystic, he will know them, but will
present them more symbolically; I mean Epaphus
and Osiris and the transfigurations of the gods
into their bestial forms.
Before all else, however, he will know the stories
of their loves, including the loves of Zeus himself,
and all the forms into which he changed himself, and
also the whole show in the realm of Hades, with the
punishments and the reasons for each, and how the
comradeship of Peirithous and Theseus brought
them even to Hades. To sum it up, he will not be
ignorant of anything that is told by Homer and
Hesiod and the best poets, and above all by tragedy.
doubt, renewed mourning over every part), and in particular,
the coming of the head to Byblus; see Lucian’s Dea Syria,
7 (IV, p. 344). The phrase is very similar to the Aaxiordv
“pov (“ piecemeal doom’’) which Lucian quotes (from a lost
tragedy) in the Piscator 2 (III, p. 3), and may have been
suggested by it. On “ Assyrian” for Syrian, see the Index.
“ The allusion to Antipater is inexplicable, unless it is to
the son of Cassander, who murdered his mother (Justin.,
XVI, 1, 1). The story of Antiochus’ love for Stratonice, the
wife of his father, Seleucus Nicator, its detection by 4 physician,
and the father’s resignation of wife and kingdom to his son is
a favourite with Lucian, and is told in Dea Syria, 17-18
(IV, pp. 360 ff.).

<note type="head">THE DANCE</head>
These are a very few themes that I have selected
out of many, or rather out of an infinite number,
and set down as the more important, leaving the rest
for the poets to sing of, for the dancers themselves
to present, and for you to add, finding them by
their likeness to those already mentioned, all of
which must lie ready, provided and stored by the
dancer in advance to meet every occasion.
Since he is imitative and undertakes to present
by means of movements all that is being sung, it
is essential for him, as for the orators, to cultivate
clearness, so that everything which he presents will
be intelligible, requiring no interpreter. No, in the
words of the Delphic oracle,! whosoever beholds
dancing must be able “to understand the mute
and hear the silent ’’ dancer.
That is just what happened, they say, in the case
of Demetrius the Cynic. He too was denouncing
the dance just as you do, saying that the dancer
was a mere adjunct to the flute and the pipes and the
stamping, himself contributing nothing to the
presentation but making absolutely meaningless,
idle movements with no sense in them at all; but
that people were duped by the accessories of the
business—the silk vestments, the beautiful mask,
the flute and its quavers, and the sweet voices of the
singers, by all of which the dancer’s business, itself
amounting to nothing at all, was embellished.
Thereupon the dancer at that time, under Nero,
sea and her ability to understand the mute and hear the silent,
before demonstrating her power by replying to the test-
question ‘‘ What is Croesus now doing” with the answer
that she could smell turtle and lamb boiling in a bronze pot
with a lid of bronze. That response, we are told, hit the mark.

in high repute, who was no fool, they say, and
excelled, if ever a man did, in remembrance of
legends and beauty of movement,! made a request
of Demetrius that was very reasonable, I think—to
see him dancing and then accuse him; he promised,
indeed, to perform for him without flute or songs.
That is what he did; enjoining silence upon the
stampers and flute-players and upon the chorus
itself, quite unsupported, he danced the amours of
Aphrodite and Ares, Helius tattling, Hephaestus
laying his plot and trapping both of them with his
entangling bonds, the gods who came in on them,
portrayed individually, Aphrodite ashamed, Ares
seeking cover and begging for mercy, and everything
that belongs to this story,? in such wise that Demetrius
was delighted beyond measure with what was taking
place and paid the highest possible tribute to the
dancer; he raised his voice and shouted at the top
of his lungs: ‘I hear the story that you are acting,
man, I do not just see it; you seem to me to be
talking with your very hands! ”’
Since we are under Nero in fancy, I wish to tell
the remark of a barbarian concerning the same
dancer, which may be considered a very great tribute
to his art. One of the barbarians from Pontus, a
man of royal blood, came to Nero on some business
or other, and among other entertainments saw that
dancer perform so vividly that although he could
not follow what was being sung—he was but half
Hellenised, as it happened—he understood every-

Paris as their stage name, of whom the emperor, some said,
was so jealous that he put him to death (Suetonius, Nero, 54).

thing. So when it came to be time for him to go back
to his own country, Nero, in saying good-bye,
urged him to ask for anything that he wanted, and
promised to give it him. “If you give me the
dancer,’ said he, ‘‘ you will please me mightily!”
When Nero asked, “‘ What good would he be to you
there? ’’, he replied, ‘‘ I have barbarian neighbours
who do not speak the same language, and it is not
easy to keep supplied with interpreters for them.
If I am in want of one, therefore, this man will
interpret everything for me by signs.” So deeply
had he been impressed by that disclosure of the dis-
tinctness and lucidity of the mimicry of the dance.
The chief occupation and the aim of dancing, as I
have said, is impersonating, which is cultivated in
the same way by the rhetoricians, particularly those
who recite these pieces that they call “ exercises ’’;
for in their case also there is nothing which we
commend more highly than their accommodating
themselves to the réles which they assume, so that
what they say is not inappropriate to the princes
or tyrant-slayers or poor people or farmers whom
they introduce, but in each of these what is individual
and distinctive is presented.
In that connection I should like to tell you some-
thing that was said by another barbarian. Noticing
that the dancer had five masks ready—the drama
had that number of acts—since he saw but the one
dancer, he enquired who were to dance and act the
other réles, and when he learned that the dancer
himself was to act and dance them all, he said;
“I did not realise, my friend, that though you have
only this one body, you have many souls.”’

<note type="head">THE DANCE</head>
Well, that is the way the barbarian viewed it.
And the Greeks of Italy quite appropriately call
the dancer a pantomime, precisely in consequence of
what he does. That poetical precept,? ‘‘ My son,
in your converse with all cities keep the way of the
sea-creature that haunts the rocks,’ is excellent,
and for the dancer essential; he must cleave close
to his matters and conform himself to each detail
of his plots.
In general, the dancer undertakes to present and
enact characters and emotions, introducing now a
lover and now an angry person, one man afflicted
with madness, another with grief, and all this within
fixed bounds. Indeed, the most surprising part of
it is that within the selfsame day at one moment
we are shown Athamas in a frenzy, at another Ino
in terror; presently the same person is Atreus,
and after a little, Thyestes; then Aegisthus, or
Aerope; yet they all are but a single man.
Moreover, the other performances that appeal to
eye and ear contain, each of them, the display of a
single activity; there is either flute or lyre or vocal
music or tragedy’s mummery or comedy’s buf-
foonery. The dancer, however, has everything at
once, and that equipment of his, we may see, is
varied and comprehensive—the flute, the pipes, the
tapping of feet, the clash of cymbals, the melodious
voice of the actor, the concord of the singers.
1 The name signifies one who mimics everything. -
2 Pindar, Fr. 43 (173) Schroeder; the reference is to the
cuttle, which was supposed to take protective colouring to
match its background. Cf. Theognis, 215-218.
3 The actor (there seems to have been but one) supported
the dancer by assuming secondary réles like the ‘‘Odysseus’’
i. hae below (p. 285). Cf. also p. 394, n. 1, and p. 402,

mended by the sophist, and Lexiph., 14 (p. 312 of this volume),
where it is used by Lexiphanes.

Then, too, all the rest are activities of one or the
other of the two elements in man, some of them
activities of the soul, some of the body; but in
dancing both are combined. For there is display
of mind in the performance as well as expression of
bodily development, and the most important part
of it is the wisdom that controls the action, and
the fact that nothing is irrational. Indeed, Lesbonax
of Mytilene, a man of excellent parts, called dancers
“ handiwise,”! and used to go to see them with the
expectation of returning from the theatre a better
man. Timocrates, too, his teacher, one day, for the
sole and only time, came in by chance, saw a dancer
ply his trade and said: “‘ What a treat for the eyes
my reverence for philosophy has deprived me of!’
If what Plato? says about the soul is true, the three
parts of it are excellently set forth by the dancer
—the orgillous part when he exhibits a man in a
rage, the covetous part when he enacts lovers, and
the reasoning part when he bridles and governs each
of the different passions; this last, to be sure, is
disseminated through every portion of the dance
just as touch is disseminated through the other
senses.2 And in planning for beauty and for
symmetry in the figures of the dance, what else does
he do but confirm the words of Aristotle, who praised
beauty and considered it to be one of the three
parts of the chief good? Moreover, I have heard
a man express an excessively venturesome opinion
3 Touch was considered not only a separate faculty, but an
element in the activity of the other four senses, each of which
was regarded as based in some sort upon physical contact;
for the method of explanation see Lucretius, IV, 324-721.

about the silence of the characters in the dance, to
the effect that it was symbolic of a Pythagorean
tenet.1
Again, some of the other pursuits promise to give
pleasure and others profit, but only the dance has
both; and indeed the profit in it is far more bene-
ficial for being associated with pleasure. How much
more delightful it is to see than young men boxing,
astream with blood, and other young men wrestling
in the dust! Why, the dance often presents them
in a way that is less risky and at the same time more
beautiful and pleasurable. As to the energetic
movement of the dance, its twists and turns and
leaps and back-flung poses, they are really not only
pleasurable to the spectators, but highly healthful
for the performers themselves. I should call it the
most excellent and best balanced of gymnastic exer-
cises, since besides making the body soft, supple and
light, and teaching it to be adroit in shifting, it also
contributes no little strength.
Then why is not dancing a thing of utter har-
mony, putting a fine edge upon the soul, disciplining
the body, delighting the beholders and teaching
them much that happened of old, to the accompani-
ment of flute and cymbals and cadenced song and
magic that works its spell through eye and ear
alike? If it is felicity of the human voice that you
seek, where else can you find it or what can you hear
that is more richly vocal or more melodious? If it
is the high-pitched music of the flute or of the syrinx,
1 Cf. Athenaeus, I, 20 p, speaking of the dancer Memphis:
“* He discloses what the Pythagorean philosophy is, revealing
everything to us in silence more clearly than those who profess
themselves teachers of the art of speech.”

in the dance you may enjoy that also to the full. I
forbear to mention that you will become better in
character through familiarity with such a spectacle,
when you see the assembly detesting misdeeds, weep-
ing over victims of injustice, and in general school-
ing the characters of the individual spectators. But
let me tell you in conclusion what is particularly to
be commended in our dancers: that they cultivate
equally both strength and suppleness of limb seems
to me as amazing as if the might of Heracles and
the daintiness of Aphrodite were to be manifested
in the same person.
I wish now to depict for you in words what a good
dancer should be like in mind and in body. To be
sure, I have already mentioned most of his mental
qualities. I hold, you know, that he should be
retentive of memory, gifted, intelligent, keenly
inventive, and above all successful in doing the
right thing at the right time; besides, he should be
able to judge poetry, to select the best songs and
melodies, and to reject worthless compositions.
What I propose to unveil now is his body, which will
conform to the canon of Polyclitus. It must be
neither very tall and inordinately lanky, nor short
and dwarfish in build, but exactly the right measure,
without being either fat, which would be fatal to
any illusion, or excessively thin; for that would
suggest skeletons and corpses.
To illustrate, I should like to tell you about the
cat-calls of a certain populace that is not slow to
mark such points. The people of Antioch, a very
talented city which especially honours the dance,
keep such an eye upon everything that is done and
said that nothing ever escapes a man of them. When

a diminutive dancer made his entrance and began
to play Hector, they all cried out in a single voice,
“Ho there, Astyanax! where is Hector?” On
another occasion, when a man who was extremely tall
undertook to dance Capaneus and assault the walls
of Thebes, ‘‘ Step over the wall,” they said, ‘“ you
have no need of a ladder!’’ And in the case of the
plump and heavy dancer who tried to make great
leaps, they said, ‘‘ We beg you, spare the stage!’
On the other hand, to one who was very thin they
called out: ‘‘ Good health to you,”’ as if he were ill.
It is not for the joke’s sake that I have mentioned
these comments, but to let you see that entire
peoples have taken a great interest in the art of
dancing, so that they could regulate its good and
bad points.
In the next place, the dancer must by all means
be agile and at once loose-jointed and well-knit, so
as to bend like a withe as occasion arises and to be
stubbornly firm if that should be requisite. That
dancing does not differ widely from the use of the
hands which figures in the public games—that it has
something in common with the noble sport of Hermes
and Pollux and Heracles, you may note by observing
each of its mimic portrayals.
Herodotus says that what is apprehended through
the eyes is more trustworthy than hearing ;! but
dancing possesses what appeals to ear and eye alike.
Its spell, too, is so potent that if a lover enters the
theatre, he is restored to his right mind by seeing all
the evil consequences of love; and one who is in the
clutch of grief Jeaves the theatre in brighter mood,
4 Herodotus, I, 8.

as if he had taken some potion that brings forgetful-
ness and, in the words of the poet, ‘‘ surcease from
sorrow and anger.’’! An indication that each of
those who see it follows closely what is going on and
understands what is being presented lies in the fact
that the spectators often weep when anything sad
and pitiful reveals itself. And certainly the Bacchic
dance that is especially cultivated in Ionia and in
Pontus, although it is a satyr-show, nevertheless
has so enthralled the people of those countries that
when the appointed time comes round they each and
all forget everything else and sit the whole day
looking at titans, corybantes, satyrs, and rustics.
Indeed, these parts in the dance are performed by
the men of the best birth and first rank in every one
of their cities, not only without shame but with
greater pride in the thing than in family trees and
public services and ancestral distinctions.
Now that I have spoken of the strong points of
dancers, let me tell you also of their defects. Those
of the body, to be sure, I have already set forth;
those of the mind I think you will be able to note
with this explanation. Many of them, through
ignorance—for it is impossible that they should all
be clever—exhibit dreadful solecisms, so to speak,
in their dancing. Some of them make senseless
movements that have nothing to do with the harp-
string, as the saying goes; for the foot says one
thing and the music another. Others suit their
movements to the music, but bring in their themes
too late or too soon, as in a case which I remember to
have seen one time. A dancer who was presenting
the birth of Zeus, with Cronus eating his children,

went off into presenting the misfortunes of Thyestes
because the similarity led him astray. And another,
trying to enact Semele stricken by the thunderbolt,
assimilated her to Glauce, who was of a later genera-
tion! But we should not condemn the dance itself,
I take it, or find fault with the activity itself on
account of such dancers; we should consider them
ignorant, as indeed they are, and should praise
those who do everything satisfactorily, in accordance
with the regulations and the rhythm of the art.?
In general, the dancer should be perfect in every
point, so as to be wholly rhythmical, graceful, sym-
metrical, consistent, unexceptionable, impeccable,
not wanting in any way, blent of the highest qualities,
keen in his ideas, profound in his culture, and above
all, human in his sentiments. In fact, the praise that
he gets from the spectators will be consummate
when each of those who behold him recognises his
own traits, or rather sees in the dancer as in a
mirror his very self, with his customary feelings and
actions. Then people cannot contain themselves
for pleasure, and with one accord they burst into
applause, each seeing the reflection of his own soul
and recognising himself. Really, that Delphic
monition “ Know thyself’’ realises itself in them
from the spectacle, and when they go away from the
theatre they have learned what they should choose
and what avoid, and have been taught what they
did not know before.
1 The reason for confusing the two parts lay in the. fact
that both were burned to death, since Glauce perished by
the poisoned robe which Medea sent her.
2 Compare Astrology 2, where the same argument (borrowed
from Plato’s Gorgias, 456 p-457 E) is employed in defence of
astrology.

<note type="head">THE DANCE</head>
As in literature, so too in dancing what is generally
called ‘‘ bad taste ’’ comes in when they exceed the
due limit of mimicry and put forth greater effort
than they should; if something large requires to
be shown, they represent it as enormous; if some-
thing dainty, they make it extravagantly effeminate,
and they carry masculinity to the point of savagery
and bestiality.
Something of that sort, I remember, I once saw
done by a dancer who until then had been in high
esteem, as he was intelligent in every way and truly
worth admiring; but by some ill-luck, I know not
what, he wrecked his fortunes upon an ugly bit of
acting through exaggerated mimicry.1_ In presenting
Ajax going mad immediately after his defeat, he so
overleaped himself that it might well have been
thought that instead of feigning madness he was
himself insane; for he tore the clothes of one of the
men that beat time with the iron shoe,? and snatching
a flute from one of the accompanists, with a vigorous
blow he cracked the crown of Odysseus, who was
standing near and exulting in his victory; indeed, if
his watch-cap had not offered resistance and borne
the brunt of the blow, poor Odysseus would have
lost his life through falling in the way of a crazy
dancer. The pit, however, all went mad with Ajax,
leaping and shouting and flinging up their garments ;
? A shoe with heavy sole, originally of wood, but by Lucian’s
time of iron (cf. Libanius, pro saltatoribus, 97), called in Greek
xpovrela, in Latin scrupeda or scabellum, was worn by the
Antepleyer or (as here) by a person specially assigned, the
scabellarius, to mark the time for the dancer and the singers.
An illustration of a flute-player wearing the scabellum, from
a mosaic in the Vatican, will be found in Daremberg et Saglio,
Dict. des Ant., 8.v. scabellum (Fig. 6142).

<note type="head">THE DANCE</head>
for the riff-raff, the absolutely unenlightened, took
no thought for propriety and could not perceive
what was good or what was bad, but thought that
sort of thing consummate mimicry of the ailment,
while the politer sort understood, to be sure, and were
ashamed of what was going on, but instead of censur-
ing the thing by silence, they themselves applauded
to cover the absurdity of the dancing, although
they perceived clearly that what went on came from
the madness of the actor, not that of Ajax. For, not
content with all this, our hero did something else that
was far more laughable. Coming down among the
public, he seated himself among the senators,
between two ex-consuls, who were very much afraid
that he would seize one of them and drub him, taking
him for a wether!
The thing caused some to marvel, some to laugh,
and some to suspect that perhaps in consequence of
his overdone mimicry he had fallen into the real
ailment. Moreover, the man himself, they say,
once he had returned to his sober senses, was so
sorry for what he had done that he really became
ill through distress and in all truth was given up
for mad. Indeed, he himself showed his repentance
clearly, for when his supporters asked him to dance
Ajax for them once more, begging to be excused,
he said to the audience, “ For an actor, it is enough
to have gone mad once!’’}_ What irked him most
was that his antagonist and rival, when cast for Ajax
in the same réle, enacted his madness so discreetly
1 The point is that only a philosopher like Chrysippus
may go mad more than once. Lucian delights in alluding
to the story that Chrysippus took the hellebore treatment
three times (True Story, 11, 18; Philosophies for Sale, 23).

and sanely as to win praise, since he kept within the
bounds of the dance and did not debauch the his-
trionic art.
These, my friend, are but a few out of manifold
achievements and activities of the dance, and I have
given you a glimpse of them in order that you may
not be highly displeased with me for viewing them
with ardent eyes. If you should care to join me in
looking on, I know very well that you will be wholly
enthralled and will even catch the dancer-craze. So
I shall not need to say to you what Circe said:
“Wonder holds me to see that you drained this
draught unenchanted.”’!
For you will be enchanted, and by Zeus it will not
be any donkey’s head or pig’s heart that you will
have, but your mind will be more firmly established
and you will be so enraptured that you will not give
even a tiny bit of the brew to anyone else to drink.
Homer says, you know, of the golden wand of Hermes
that he “ charmeth the eyes of men” with it,
“* Whomsoever he wishes, and others he wakes
that are sleeping.” ?
Really, dancing does just that: it charms the eyes
and makes them wide awake, and it rouses the
mind to respond to every detail of its performances.
CRATO
Upon my word, Lycinus, I have come to the point
of believing you and am all agog, ear and eye alike.
Do remember, my friend, when you go to the theatre,
to reserve me a seat at your side, in order that you
may not be the only one to come back to us wiser!

<div type="translation" n="tlg0062.tlg046">
<head>LEXIPHANES<note><p>Lexiphanes ("Word-flaunter”), whose enthusiasm for
Attic diction is equalled by his want of ideas, of schooling, and
of taste, has his jacket soundly dusted by his friend Lycinus.
The piece is sufficiently similar to the Professor of Public
Speaking to have given rise to the idea that it is aimed at the
same man, and that Lexiphanes is Pollux, the lexicographer
(cf. IV, p. 133). To the argument of E. E. Seiler against
this view (which was not that of Ranke), two points may be
added, which seem to settle the matter. The ‘‘ namesake
of the sons of Zeus and Leda ” cannot be Lexiphanes because
‘* fifteen, or anyhow not more than twenty, Attic words ”
with which to besprinkle his speeches suffice him (IV, p. 155),
whereas Lexiphanes revels in rarities and glories in the obscurity
of his style. Moreover, Lexiphanes is so thoroughly addicted
to this jargon of his that he uses it even in conversation. How,
then (unless we assume that Lucian’s castigation reformed
him), can he ever have written in a style as normal as that
of the Onomasticon ?</p>
<p>Curiously enough, the cult of rare words is not conspicuous
in the Greek prose of the time, but in the Latin, with Fronto
as its most ardent devotee. The Atticists so tempered zeal
with discretion that nothing comparableto the extravagances
of Lexiphanes is to be found outside of the pages of Athenaeus
(III, 97 ¢: Gulick, I, p. 419), where Cynulcus takes Ulpian
to task for just this sort of thing, adverts upon Pompeianus
of Philadelphia as a bird of the same feather, and implies
wider circle by alluding to ‘‘ the Ulpianean sophists.” This
is certainly the group to which our man belonged (cf. c. 14).
The time is right—just right if Ulpian was the father of the
famous jurist; and these people not only use the selfsame
jargon (see the notes for the parallels), but employ it even in
conversation. Seiler’s contention that Lexiphanes is Pompei-
anus is highly probable but not wholly certain because it
is impossible to fix the extent to which the vocabulary of the
"Ulpianeans” was common stock.</p>
<p>A conspicuous feature of Lucian’s parody of Lexiphanes
is the use of words no longer generally employed in the old
sense but in a new and very different one, so that double
meanings result. Adequate translation therefore is often
quite impossible, for the lack of an equivalent expression.</p></note></head>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="1"><p>


LYCINUS
Lexiphanes, the glass of fashion, with a book?
LEXIPHANES
Yes, Lycinus; ’tis one of my own productions of
this very season, quite recent.
LYCINUS
Why, are you now writing us something indecent ? 2
LEXIPHANES
No, forsooth, and I did not say indecent. Come,
it is full time you learned to apply that word of
mine to things newly indited. It would seem that
your ears are stopped with wax.
LYCINUS
Excuse me, my friend. Between indecent and
recent there is a great dealin common. But tell me,
what is the theme of your work?
LEXIPHANES
I am counter-banqueting the son of Aristo in it.
* Lucian pretends to confuse veoyyds (recent, novel) with
avxpds (drought)—an equivoque quite impossible, I think,
to reproduce exactly in English.

LYCINUS
There are many “ Aristos,” but to judge from
your “‘ banquet’ I suppose you mean Plato.
LEXIPHANES
You rede me right, but what I said would have
been caviare to the general.
LYCINUS
Well then, you must read me a few passages from
the book, so that I shan’t miss the feast entirely,
I dare say you will properly ‘“‘ wine us with nectar ”
out of it.
LEXIPHANES
Suppress Master Irony, then, and make your ears
permeable before you give them to me. Avaunt
with the obturations of Dame Cypselis!?
LYCINUS
Say your say confidently, for no Cypselus nor any
Periander ® has taken up lodgings in my ears.
' LEXIPHANES
Consider withal how I carry myself in the book
—whether it has a good entrance, a rich display of
good discourse and composure,‘ and good store of
egregious words.
2 The name Cypselis (Waxy) is coined from cypselé (ear-
wax).
3 Periander comes in because he too was a Cypselid.

‘‘ Then we shall dine,” quoth Callicles, ‘“ and then,
at eventide, fetch a turn in the Lyceum; but now
it is high season to endue ourselves with sunburn
and tepify ourselves in the calid ambient, and after
laving, to break bread. We must away forthwith.
My lad, convoy me my strigil, scrip, diapers, and
purgaments to the bath-house, and fetch the where-
withal. ’Tis on the floor, mark you, alongside the
coffer, a brace of obols. And you, Lexiphanes,
whatever shall you do? Shall you come, or tarry
yet a while hereabouts?”
“‘T too,” said I, ‘‘ am yearning to ablute these ages
past, for I am ill-conditioned, susceptible behind from
riding pillion on a mule. The muleteer kept me
going, though he himself was jigging it hot-foot.1
But even in the country I was not unassiduous, for
I found the yokels caroling the harvest-home;
some of them, too, were preparing a grave for my
father. After I had assisted them in the engraving
and for a brief space shared the handiwork of the
dikers, I dispersed them on account of the cold and
because they were getting burned (in severe cold,
you know, burning ensues).?_ For myself, I got about
the simples, found prickmadam growing among
them, exhumed sundry radishes, garnered chervils
and potherbs, and bought groats. But the meads
were not yet redolent enough for travelling by shank’s

feared that we may lave in the leavings of the
bargashes, along with the scum, in a jostle.”” Then
said Hellanicus: ‘‘ I look askew, for my dollies are
obfuscate, I nictitate full oft, and I am lachrymose ;
mine eyes want drugging, I require some scion of
Aesculapius, sage in ophthalmotherapy, who will
compound and decant a specific for me, and so
effect that my ruddy optics may be decoloured
and no longer be rheumatic or have a humorous
cast.”
Discoursing in this wise, all those of us present
were gone. When we came to the gymnasium, we
despoiled ourselves. One exercised himself at
wrestling with shoulder-holds, another with neck-
holds, standing; one sleeked himself with unguent
and essayed eluding grasps; one countered the
wind-bag,! one, grasping leaden sows, whipped his
arms about. Then, once we were dressed down ?
and had backed each other, and used the gymnasium
for our sport, Philinus and I imbathed ourselves in
the hot pool and emerged, while the rest, beducking
their sconces in the cold plunge, swam about
subaquaneous in wondrous guise.
Upon reversion, we imbusied ourselves with this,
that or t’other. I myself indued my boots, dressed
my scalp with a tined card,? for I had got shorn
with the “ bowl’’ cut, not the “ bush’’; for not long
1 He exercised with the ‘‘ punching-bag.”
2 To Lexiphanes, ovyrp:Bérres is an allusion to the “rub-
down”? previous mentioned; but others would infer from it
that somebody had cracked their crowns for them. Cf.
Athen., 98 4 (Pompeianus).
3 The regular word for comb (xreig or xrévov) was not
elegant enough for Lexiphanes.

Someone else was gobbling lupines, another was
evomiting his jejunity, another was. diminishing
radishes and sopping up a mess of fishy pottage,
another was eating flummery,? and yet another en-
gorging barley brose.
When the time was ripe, we dined on our elbows.
Both faldstools and truckles were at hand. The
dinner was picked up;* many different viands had
been made ready, pig’s trotters, spareribs, tripe, the
caul of a sow that had littered, panned pluck, spoon-
meat of cheese and honey, shallot-pickle and other
such condiments, crumpets, stuffed fig-leaves, sweets.

and we had a whole sheep barbecued, and the
hind-quarter of an edentulous ox. Besides, there
was bread from Siphae, not bad, and novilunar buns,
too late for the fair, as well as vegetables, both
underground and over grown. And there was wine,
not vetust, but out of a leathern bottle, dry by
now but still crude.

1 Apparently the ‘‘ bush’’ cut required a good head of
hair, but did not need to be combed. Both styles had been
for centuries out of fashion in Lexiphanes’ day.
2 In the Greek the food is different (queen olives), but the
name carries a similar suggestion of rubbish.
3 The phrase dmé cvpdopav to Lexiphanes meant “ off
contributions ”’ (of the individual guests), but to anyone else in
his day it meant ‘‘ off catastrophes.”

1 This is said to be the only reference to Mentor in extant
Greek literature. The scholia allude to him as a maker of
glassware, but various allusions in Latin writers from Cicero
to Juvenal and Martial (especially Pliny, Nat. Hist., XX XIII,
147) make it clear that he was a silversmith whose productions
were highly esteemed as antiques in Cicero’s time. When and
where he lived is not indicated.
2 Thericles seems to have been a Corinthian potter, con-
temporary with Aristophanes (Athen., XI, 470). His name
became attached to certain shapes, and even to imitations

used to bake, vessels both ventricose and patulous,
some from Phocaeawards, other some from Cnidos
way, all airy trifles,3 hymen-thin. There were also
boats, chalices, and lettered mugs,‘ so that the
cupboard was full.
The calefactor,5 however, slopped over on our
heads and delivered us a consignment of coals. But
we drank bottoms up and soon were well fortified.
Then we endued ourselves with baccharis, and
someone trundled in the girl that treads the mazy
and juggles balls; after which, one of us, scrambling
up to the coekloft, went looking for something to
top off with,® whilst another fell to thrumming and
another laughingly wriggled his hips.
Meantime, after lavation, came rollicking in to
us, self-invited, Megalonymus the pettifogger,
Chaereas the goldworker, he with the back of many
colours, and Eudemus the broken-ear.”? I asked
of these shapes in metal, made at Athens and Rhodes (Athen.
XI, 469 8). Cicero (in Verrem, II, 4, 38) speaks of certain cups
that are called Thericleian, made by the hand of Mentor with
supreme craftsmanship. .
* By dvepogépyra Lexiphanes means ‘‘ light enough to blow
away,” but might be taken to mean ‘‘ wind-blown.” Cf.
addpyra, p. 307, n. 5.

5 According to Athen., III, 98c, the name imvoAdBys was
used by the “ pinean Sophists’’ for the apparatus for
heating water which the Romans called a pudkdprov.
6 The word ém¢dpnua means at once coverlet and (in
Tonic) dessert.
7 Chaereas’ back bore the stripes of the lash; Eudemus was

that court was not held on it, cf. Athen. 98 B (Pompeianus).
* Both the verbs of the original (rendered “ palaver ”’

to the custom of timing pleas by the water-clock. One of

Chaereas: “‘ I was forging trumpery for my daughter,
balls and chains, and that is why I have come in
on top of your dinner.” ‘For my part,’’ quoth
Megalonymus, ‘‘I was about other matters. The
day was incapable of justice,! as ye wit, and incom-
petent for pleading; wherefore, as there was a truce
of the tongue, I was unable either to palaver or, as
is my diurnal habit, to solicit.2, Learning that the
magistrate was being grilled in public,? I took an
unvalued ‘ cloak, of sheer tissue, and priceless 5 boots,
and emitted myself.
Forthwith I hit upon the Torch-bearer and the
Hierophant, with the other participants in un-
utterable rites,® haling Deinias neck and crop to
the office, bringing the charge that he had named
them, albeit he knew right well that from the time
when they were hallowed they were nameless
and thenceforth ineffable, as being now all Hierony-
muses.”’?
“IT do not know,” said I, “ the Deinias that you
mention, but the name intrigues me.’’& “ A clove-
3 Lexiphanes would be understood to mean ‘‘ roasted,”
but what he really meant was “‘ visible.” Cf. Athen., 98 a
(Pompeianus).
‘ For dxpyora, usually ‘‘ useless,” in the sense ‘‘ unused,”
ef. Athen., 98 a (Pompeianus), 97 & (Ulpian).
5 In the Greek, dfédpy7a (‘‘unbearable’’) in the sense
“unworn,” cf. Athen., 98 a (Pompeianus).
6 Those of the Eleusinian Mysteries.
7 The adjective ‘‘ of hallowed name’’ was itself used as a
name, Unintentionally, Lexiphanes suggests that they have
changed their names.
8 No doubt because the name deinias was given to a variety
of drinking pot (Athenaeus, XI, 467 pD—z).

“that fellow, the whilom swaggerer, is now en-

3 Out of compliment to him as a champion, his statue was
set up in the square.
hat a ‘‘Termerian misfortune’? was, the ancients
themselves do not seem to have known, except that it was a
great one, and that ‘‘ Termerian ’’ was derived from a name—

chewing aesthete, who strouts and gropes if ever he
sees anyone that is well hung? He is a scapegrace

lyart-polled,? flung themselves upon her and besought
her to pity them. She at once inclined her head,

pleasure in these; for Artemis is a good bowyer,
she is a Far-darter, a very Telemachus.’’>

these earthen cups of cockle-shell, stanchly bottomed,
for us to drink out of, and a cake of chitterlings
braided like a topknot. My lad, pour in more of
the water for me, that I may not begin to have a
head, and then call your keeper to come for you.
You know that I have my pains and keep my head
invested. And now that we have drunk, we shall
gossip according to our wont, for in good sooth it is
not inopportune to prate when we are in our cups.”
“T approve this,” said I, ‘‘ and why not, for we are
the sheer quintessence of Atticism.’”’ ‘ Very true,”
quoth Callicles, ‘‘ for quizzing each other incessantly
is a whet to loquacity.”’ “‘ As to me,’’ said Eudemus,
“‘ since it is brumal I had liefer fence myself with
stiffer drink. I am starved with cold, and when I
am warmed I would fain hear these handiwise }
folk, the flute-player and the harper.”
“What was that you said, Eudemus?”’ said I.
“ Do you enjoin alogy upon us as if we were inarticu-
late and elinguid? My tongue is already pregnant
with utterance, and in sooth I set sail in the intent
to archaise with you and wash you up with my
tongue, one and all. But you have treated me as if
a three-masted vessel were sailing before the wind
with full kites, running easy and spooming over the
billows, and then someone, letting go double-tongued
refrainers,? pigs of iron,? and bowers, were to curb
the impetuosity of her course, begrudging her the
fair wind.”
2 In view of the fact that to the Greeks Hector was a
“holder,” Lexiphanes can cause us to imagine that hero per-
forming new and strange feats.
3 For doxds (‘fig ’’) used, in the sense ‘‘ holder,” to apply
to an anchor, cf. Athen., 99 c—p, where it is attributed to
Sophocles (Fr. 761 Pearson).

“ Well, then,” quoth he, “ you, if you like, may
sail and swim and course over the main, but I from
off the land, with a drink at my elbow, like Homer’s
Zeus, shall look upon you either from a bald cop or
the pitch of heaven as you drive and the wind gives

LYCINUS
Enough, Lexiphanes, both of the drinking-party
and of the reading. I am already half-seas-over and
squeamish, and if I do not very soon jettison all this
gallimaufry of yours, depend upon it, I expect to
go raving crazy with the roaring in my ears from
the words with which you have showered me. At
first I was inclined to laugh at it all, but when it
turned out to be such a quantity and all of a sort, I
pitied you for your hard luck, seeing that you had
fallen into a labyrinthine maze from which there was
no escaping and were afflicted with the most serious
of all illnesses—I mean, were as mad as a hatter.
I have been quietly wondering from what source
you have culled so much pestilential stuff, and how
long it took you, and where you locked up and kept
such a swarm of outlandish distorted expressions,
of which you made some yourself and resurrected
others from the graves in which they lay buried
somewhere. As the verse puts it,
Plague take you, that you garner mortal woes,
such a mess of filthy bilge water did you get together
and fling over me, when I had done you no harm at
all. Youseem to me not only to be destitute of friends
and relatives and well-wishers but never to have
fallen in with an independent man practising frank-

ness, who by telling you the truth might have relieved
you, dropsical as you are and in danger of bursting
with the disease, although to yourself you appear
to be in good point and you consider your calami
the pink of condition. You are praised by the fools,
to be sure, who do not know what ails you; but the
intelligent fittingly pity you.
But what luck! here I see Sopolis the physician
drawing near. Come now, suppose we put you in his
hands, have a consultation with him about your
complaint, and find some cure for you. The man
is clever, and often before now, taking charge of
people like yourself, half crazed and full of drivel,
he has relieved them with his doses of medicine.
—Good-day to you, Sopolis. Do take charge of
Lexiphanes here, who is my friend, as you know,
and at present has on him a nonsensical, outlandish
distemper affecting his speech which is likely to be
the death of him outright. Do save him in one way
or another.
LEXIPHANES
Not me, Sopolis, but this man Lycinus, who is
patently maggoty and thinks that well-furnished
heads want wits, and imposes silence and a truce of
the tongue upon us in the style of the son of Mne-
sarchus, the Samian.1_ But I protest, by bashless
Athena and by mighty Heracles, slayer of ferines,
I shan’t bother even a flock or a doit about him! In
fact I abominate meeting him at all, and I am fit to
snort when I hear him pass such censure. Any-
1 Pythagoras; in Philosophies for Sale, 3 (II, 454) Lucian
alludes to the five years of silence which he imposed on his
pupils.

how, I am this moment going off to my comrade
Cleinias’s because I am informed that for some time
now his wife is irregular! and out of sorts by reason
of wanting issue, so that he no longer even knows
her ; she is unapproachable and uncultivated.
SOPOLIS
What ails him, Lycinus?
LYCINUS
Just that, Sopolis! Can’t you hear how he talks?
Abandoning us, who converse with him now, he talks
to us from a thousand years ago, distorting his
language, making these preposterous combinations,
and taking himself very seriously in the matter, as
if it were a great thing for him to use an alien
idiom and debase the established currency of speech.
SOPOLIS
By Zeus, it is no trivial disorder you tell of, Lycinus.
The man must be helped by all means. As good
luck would have it, I came away with this medicine,
made up for an insane person, so that by taking it he
might throw off his bile. Come, you be the first to
take it, Lexiphanes, that we may have you cured
and cleansed, once you have rid yourself of such
impossible language. Do obey me and take it, and
you will feel better.
LEXIPHANES
I don’t know what you and Lycinus mean to do
to me, Sopolis, plying me with this drench. Indeed,
I fear your draught may chill my vocabulary.

Drink without delay, that at last you may be
human in thought and speech.
LEXIPHANES
There, I obey and drink. Oh me, what is this?
The bombilation is vast! I would seem to have
swallowed a familiar spirit.
SOPOLIS
Begin now to lighten yourself. Aha! First, this
“ prithee,”’ then after it “‘ eftsoons ’’ has come up;
then on their heels his “ quoth he ’’ and “ in some
wise,’ and “fair sir,’”’ and ‘‘in sooth,’ and _ his
incessant “ sundry.’’ Make an effort, however; put
your fingers down your throat. You have not yet
given up “ instanter ”’ or ‘‘ pandiculation ” or “ diva-
gation” or ‘‘spoliation.’” Many things still lurk in
hiding and your inwards are full of them.?_ It would
be better if some should take the opposite course,
Anyhow, “ vilipendency ”’ will make a great racket
when it comes tumbling out on the wings of the
wind.
Well, this man is now purged, unless something
has remained behind in his lower intestines. It is
for you next, Lycinus, to take him on, mending his
education and teaching him what to say.

LYCINUS
That I will, Sopolis, since you have cleared the
way for me, and the advice which will follow is to
your address, Lexiphanes. If you really desire to
be genuinely praised for style and to have a great
name among the public, avoid and shun all this sort
of thing. After beginning with the best poets and
reading them under tutors, pass to the orators, and
when you have become familiar with their diction,
go over in due time to Thucydides and Plato—but
only after you have first disciplined yourself
thoroughly in attractive comedy and sober tragedy.
When you have garnered all that is fairest from these
sources, you will be a personality in letters. Before,
you had unconsciously become like the images shaped
for the market by the modellers of figurines, coloured
with red and blue on the surface, but clay on the
inside, and very fragile.
If you do this, abiding for a time the reproach of
illiteracy and feeling no shame to mend your know-
ledge, you will address the public confidently and
will not be laughed at as you are now, or talked
about in an uncomplimentary manner by our best
people, who dub you “the Greek” and “the
Athenian ” when you do not deserve to be numbered
even among the most intelligible of barbarians.
Before all else, however, please remember not to
imitate the most worthless productions of the
Sophists who lived only a little before our own
time, or to go nibbling at that stuff as you do now
—tread that sort of thing underfoot and copy the
ancient models only. And do not let yourself be
enticed by the wind-flowers of speech, but follow
the custom of the athletes and habituate yourself

to solid nourishment. Above all, sacrifice to the
Graces and to Clearness; you are very remote from
them at present! As for vanity, boastfulness and
malice, blustering and bawling, away with them,
and with girding at the works of all others and
thinking that you yourself will be first if you carp
at the achievements of everyone else.
Yes, and there is also this fault which you have,
not a slight one, but rather the greatest possible :
you do not prepare your thoughts in advance of
your words and subsequently dress them out in the
parts of speech, but if you find anywhere an out-
landish expression or make one up yourself and
think it pretty, you endeavour to fit the thought to
it and think yourself damaged if you cannot stuff it
in somewhere, even if it is not essential to what you
are saying. For example, the other day, without
even knowing what “‘scintilla’’ meant, you tossed it
off when it had no relation at all to the subject,
and the vulgar to a man were dazed when its
unfamiliarity struck their ears, but the well-informed
laughed, not only at you but at your admirers.
What is most ridiculous of all is that although you
want to be more than Attic and have meticulously
shaped your diction after the most antiquated
pattern, some (or rather, most) of the expressions
which you intermingle with what you say are
such that even a boy just beginning school would
not fail to know them. For instance, you can’t
think how I prayed for the earth to swallow me as I
listened to the exhibition you made of yourself
when you thought that “ shift’? meant a man’s
garment also, and used “ slatterns ”’ of male servants
when who does not know that a shift is a female

And there were other things far more obvious than
these, like “‘flopped’’! and “‘ meeting up”? and
“setting,” > which are not even naturalised in the
Attic tongue. We do not praise even poets who
compose poems that are all full of rare words, but
your compositions, if I might compare prose to verse,
would be like the ‘“ Altar’’ of Dosiadas, the
“ Alexandra ”’ of Lycophron, and whatever else
is still more infelicitous in diction than those works.
If you imitate the men of whom I have spoken

planned the best possible course for yourself, but if
you unwittingly slip back into your preciosity, I at
least have done my part in advising you and you
may blame yourself, if indeed you are conscious of
deterioration.

« For the Altar of Dosiadas see Edmonda, Greek Bucolic Poets

<nhead>THE EUNUCH<note><p>A malicously satirical account of a competition for one
of the chairs in philosophy established at Athens, along with
a@ chair in rhetoric, by Marcus Aurelius. The chairs in
pilose hy were apportioned to four sects only—Platonic,
toic, Epicurean, and Peripatetic. That there were two chairs
for each of these sects, not merely one, is clear from the
statement that this vacancy is due (c. 3) to the death of
one of the two Peripatetics (rdv [lepumarnrixdv olwae rev
€repov). Each chair carried a stipend of 10,000 drachmas.
The first appointment in rhetoric (Theodotus) was made by
the emperor himself; those in philosophy were committed
to Herodes Atticus, who, however, cannot have made any
nominations after the first, as the chairs were established in
November, 176 a.p., and the death of Herodes can hardly be
dated later than 178 a.p. It is not surprising, therefore,
that Lucian speaks of selection by a jury of prominent
Athenians.</p>
<p>It is not probable that the incident occurred before 179 a.p.,
and it may easily have been much later. The dialogue was
undoubtedly written at the time, and at Athens. The names
given to the competitors are fictitious, and nothing is known
ae affords any ground for conjecture as to the identity of
either one.</p></note></head>

PAMPHILUS
Where have you been, Lycinus, and what are you
laughing at, I should like to know, as you come?
Of course, you are always in a good humour, but this
appears to me to be something out of the ordinary,
as you cannot restrain your laughter over it.
LYCINUS
I have been in the Agora, I’d have you know,
Pamphilus; and I shall make you share my laughter
at once if you let me tell you what sort of case has
been tried in my presence, between philosophers
wrangling with each other.
PAMPHILUS
Well, what you have already said is laughable, in
all truth, that followers of philosophy should have it
out with one another at law, when they ought, even
if it should be something of importance, to settle their
complaints peaceably among themselves.
LYCINUS
Indeed, you blessed simpleton! Peaceably! They!
Why, they came together at full tilt and flung whole
cartloads of abuse upon each other, shouting and
straining their lungs enough to split them!

PAMPHILUS
No doubt, Lycinus, they were bickering about their
doctrines, as usual, being of different sects?
LYCINUS
Not at all; this was something different, for they
were of the same sect and agreed in their doctrines.
Nevertheless, a trial had been arranged, and the
judges, endowed with the deciding vote, were the
most prominent and oldest and wisest men in the
city, in whose presence one would have been ashamed
even to strike a false note, let alone resorting to such
shamelessness.
PAMPHILUS
Then do please tell me at once the point at issue
in the trial, so that I may know what it is that has
stirred up so much laughter in you.
LYCINUS
Well, Pamphilus, the Emperor has established, as
you know, an allowance, not inconsiderable, for the
philosophers according to sect—the Stoics, I mean,
the Platonics, and the Epicureans; also those of the
Walk, the same amount for each of these. It was
stipulated that when one of them died another should
be appointed in his stead, after being approved by
vote of the first citizens. And the prize was not ‘‘ a
shield of hide or a victim,” as the poet has it,! but a
matter of ten thousand drachmas a year, for instruct-
ing boys.
PAMPHILUS
I know all that; and one of them died, they say,
recently—one of the two Peripatetics, I think.

LYCINUS
That, Pamphilus, is the Helen for whom they were
meeting each other in single combat. And up to
this point there was nothing to laugh at except per-
haps that men rah to be philosophers and to
despise lucre should fight for it as if for imperilled
fatherland, ancestral fanes, and graves of forefathers.
PAMPHILUS
Yes, but that is the doctrine of the Peripatetics,
not to despise wealth vehemently but to think it a
third “ supreme good.”
LYCINUS
Right you are; they do say that, and the war
that they were waging was on traditional lines. But
listen now to the sequel.
Many competitors took part in the funeral games
of the deceased, but two of them in particular were
the most favoured to win, the aged Diocles (you
know the man I mean, the dialectician) and Bagoas,
the one who is reputed to be a eunuch. The matter
of doctrines had been thrashed out between them
already, and each had displayed his familiarity with
their tenets and his adherence to Aristotle and his
placita; and by Zeus neither of them had the better
of it. The close of the trial, however, took a new
turn; Diocles, discontinuing the advertisement of
his own merits, passed over to Bagoas and made a
great effort to show up his private life, and Bagoas
met this attack by exploring the history of Diocles
in like manner.

PAMPHILUS
Naturally, Lycinus ; and the greater part, certainly,
of their discussion ought rather to have centred upon
that. For my own part, if I had chanced to be a
judge, I should have dwelt most, I think, upon that
sort of thing, trying to ascertain which led the better
life rather than which was the better prepared in the
tenets themselves, and deeming him more suitable
to win.
LYCINUS
Well said, and you have me voting with you in this.
But when they had their fill of hard words, and their
fill of caustic observations, Diocles at length said in
conclusion that it was not at all permissible for
Bagoas to lay claim to philosophy and the rewards
of merit in it, since he was a eunuch; such people
ought to be excluded, he thought, not simply from
all that but even from temples and holy-water bowls
and all the places of public assembly, and he declared
it an ill-omened, ill-met sight if on first leaving home
in the morning, one should set eyes on any such
person. He had a great deal to say, too, on that
score, observing that a eunuch was neither man nor
woman but something composite, hybrid, and
monstrous, alien to human nature.
PAMPHILUS
The charge you tell of, Lycinus, is novel, anyhow,
and now I too, my friend, am moved to laughter,
hearing of this incredible accusation. Well, what
of the other? Held his peace, did he not? Or did
he venture to say something himself in reply to this?

LYCINUS
At first, through shame and cowardice—for that
sort of behaviour is natural to them—he remained
silent a long while and blushed and was plainly in a
sweat, but finally in a weak, effeminate voice he said
that Diocles was acting unjustly in trying to exclude
a eunuch from philosophy, in which even women had
a part; and he brought in Aspasia, Diotima, and
Thargelia 1 to support his also a certain Academic
eunuch hailing from among the Pelasgians, who shortly
before our time achieved a high reputation among
the Greeks.2 But if that person himself were alive
and advanced similar claims, Diocles would (he
said) have excluded him too, undismayed by his
reputation among the common sort ; and he repeated
a number of humorous remarks made to the man by
Stoics and Cynics regarding his physical imper-
fection.?
That was what the judges dwelt upon, and the point
thenceforward at issue was whether the seal of approval
should be set upon a eunuch who was proposing him-
self for a career in philosophy and requesting that
the governance of boys be committed to him. One
the Socratic wrote about her, the sophist Hippias spoke of
her as beautiful and wise, and Aspasia is said to have taken
her as a pattern. Diotima is the priestess of Mantinea to
whom, in Plato’s Symposium, Socrates ascribes the discourse
on love which he repeats.to the company. Subsequent
mention of her seems to derive from that passage, and it is
possible that Plato invented her.
* The allusion is to Favorinus of Arles, known to us from
Philostratus and especially from Aulus Gellius. Part of his
treatise on exile has been recovered recently from an Egyptian
papyrus and poe ished by Medea Norea and Vitelli.
3 Among the ics was Demonax; see Lucian’s Demonaz,
12 and 13 (I, pp. 150 ff.).

said that presence and a fine physical endowment
should be among the attributes of a philosopher, and
that above all else he should have a long beard that
would inspire confidence in those who visited him
and sought to become his pupils, one that would
befit the ten thousand drachmas which he was to
receive from the Emperor, whereas a eunuch was in
worse case than a cut priest, for the latter had at
least known manhood once, but the former had been
marred from the very first and was an ambiguous sort
of creature like a crow, which cannot be reckoned
either with doves or with ravens. The other pleaded
that this was not a physical examination; that there
should be an investigation of soul and mind and
knowledge of doctrines. Then Aristotle was cited
as a witness to support his case, since he tremendously
admired the eunuch Hermias, the tyrant of Atarneus,
to the point of celebrating sacrifices to him in the
same way as to the gods. Moreover, Bagoas ventured
to add an observation to the effect that a eunuch was
a far more suitable teacher for the young, since he
could not incur any blame as regards them and would
not incur that charge against Socrates of leading the
youngsters astray. And as he had been ridiculed
especially for his beardlessness, he despatched this
shaft to good effect—he thought so, anyhow: “If
it is by length of beard that philosophers are to be
judged, a he-goat would with greater justice be given
preference to all of them! ””
At this juncture a third person who was present—
his name may remain in obscurity—said:1 ‘“‘ As a
matter of fact, gentlemen, if this fellow, so smooth

of jowl, effeminate in voice, and otherwise similar to
a eunuch, should strip, you would find him very
masculine. Unless those who talk about him are
lying, he was once taken in adultery, commissis
membris, as the table of the law says. At that time
he secured his acquittal by resorting to the name of
eunuch and finding sanctuary in it, since the judges
on that occasion discredited the accusation from the
very look of him. Now, however, he may recant, I
suppose, for the sake of the pelf that is in view.”
Upon those remarks everyone began to laugh, as
was natural, while Bagoas fell into greater confusion
and. was beside himself, turning all colours of the
rainbow and dripping with cold sweat. On the one
hand, he did not think it seemly to plead guilty to
the charge of adultery; yet, on the other, he thought
that this accusation would not be without its useful-
ness for the case then in progress.
PAMPHILUS
This is truly laughable, Lycinus, and must have
given you uncommon diversion. But what was the
outcome, and how did the judges decide about them?
LYCINUS
They were not all of the same opinion. Some
thought they ought to strip him, as is done with
slaves, and determine by inspection whether he had
the parts to practise philosophy. Others made the
suggestion, even more ridiculous, that they should
send for some women out of bawdy-houses and bid
him consort with them and cohabit; and that one
of the judges, the eldest and most trustworthy,

should stand by and see whether he could practise
philosophy! Then, as all were overcome by laughter
and every man of them had a sore belly from shaking
with it, they decided to refer the case to the highest
court and send it to Italy.
Now, one of the pair is training, they say, for a
demonstration of his eloquence, making his prepara-
tions, and composing an accusation. Morever, he
is delicately putting forward the charge of adultery
again, thereby acting in direct contradiction to him-
self, like a bad lawyer, and enrolling his opponent
among fully enfranchised males through his accusa-
tion. As to Bagoas, he, they say, has different
concerns, assiduously demonstrating his powers,
keeping his case in hand, and, in sum, hoping to win
if he can show that he is not a bit inferior to a jack
at service. This, my friend, is apparently the best
criterion of devotion to wisdom, and an irrefutable
demonstration. Consequently, I may well pray that
my son (who is still quite young) may be suitably
endowed for the practise of philosophy with other
tools than brain or tongue.

<div type="translation" n="tlg0062.tlg048">
<head>ASTROLOGY<note><p>A mock eulogy of judicial astrology, put into the mouth of
some ancient worthy who used the Ionic dialect, almost
certainly Democritus, the peer of Herodotus in Ionic prose
style and the author, according to Cicero (de Divin., I, 42),
of a treatise on extispicy. The thing is so clever that it has
duped almost everyone, including myself (I, ix), into taking
it in earnest and proclaiming it spurious. Its Lucianic
origin, however, is apparent if one looks closely enough.
Orpheus, elsewhere in Lucian given a leading part in the
introduction of philosophy (p. 65) and of dancing (p. 229) into
Greece, is here the promulgator of astrology—but not ‘* unto
elucidation.”” Odysseus in the lower world 13 so eager to hear
what Tiresias may have to say that he ‘‘ endures to see his
mother’s shadow athirst,” no doubt like to die of it, even as
Tantalus (Funerals, 8: IV, 116). The novel assumption that
different peoples of Egypt worship different signs of the Zodiac
serves to explain not only the animal shapes of their gods—
a topic to which Lucian mischievously keeps recurring (cf.
pp. 431 f., and III, 168), but the taboo upon fish to which,
with Herodotean reticence as to its reason, he alludes in the
Goddesse of Surrye, 14 (IV, 356). The same fondness for
rationalizing myths with a twinkle in his eye, which elsewhere
turns not only Proteus but Empusa into pantomimic dancers
(pp. 231f.), here asserts itself with complete abandon, in an
astrological sense, even to the point of including Pasiphae
among theadepts. And when sheer love of story-telling seduces
him into repeating a favourite tale, that of Phaethon, his style
betrays him utterly (cf. Amber, and Dialogues of the Gods, 25).
It is only mock eulogy, but still, in spite of the fun in it,
not quite meant as satire or parody. It is primarily a bal ala
literary exercise of the same nature as the first and second
Phalaris, in which the fun is incidental—a Lucianic ‘‘ parergy.””
To get something of the effect, the translation is intended
to carry a suggestion of Sir Thomas Browne as. he appears
in the Vulgar Errors.</p></note></head>

Tuts treatise concerneth heaven and the stars, yet
not the stars themselves nor heaven itself, but the
auspiciall verity that from them assuredly entereth
into the life of man. My discourse containeth not
counsell, nor proffereth instruction how to ply this
auspiciall art, but my aim is to chide those learned
men who cultivate and expose unto their disciples all
other studies, but neither esteem nor cultivate
astrology. Although the science is ancient, not come
to us newly, but the creation of divinely favoured
kings of antiquity, yet men of these daies, through
ignorance, supinity, and mislike of labour, hold
opinions repugnant unto theirs, and when they
encounter men that make false prognostickes, they
impeach the stars and contemne astrology itself,
which they consider neither sound nor veridicall but a
vain and idle fiction; wherein, as I think, the
judge unjustly. For a wright’s unskillfullness
argueth not the wright’s art in error, nor a piper’s
untunefullness the art of musick devoid of sense.
Rather are they ignorant of their arts, and each of
these in itself rationall.1

It was the Aethiopians that first delivered this

the wisdom of that nation, the Aethiopians being in
all else wiser than all men; but in part also the
benignity of their clime, since clear skyes and calm

ance, but carrieth a various aspect and changeth into
divers figures, they accounted the thing good reason
for wonder and empuzzlement. In consequence they
sought and found the cause thereof, that the lustre
of the moon is not her own but cometh to her from the
sun. And they determined also the course of the
other stars, which we call planets or wanderers
because they alone of all the stars do move; also
their nature and potency, and the works that are
brought to pass by each of them. Also, they
ascribed names unto them, that yet were not
names, as they seemed, but symboles.
All which the Aethiopians observed in the skye,
and afterwards they transmitted their doctrine
incompleat to the Aegyptians. And the Aegyptians,
deriving from them the auspiciall art but half con-
summated, advanced it; and they indicated the
measure of each planet’s motion, and determined
the numericall extension of yeares and moneths and
hours. The moneths they measured by the moon
that they first taught people to worship the gods, that the
Egyptians were their colonists, and that most of the Egyptian
institutions were Ethiopian. And if, as we read in the Platonic
Epinomis and in Macrobius (Comm. in Cic. Somn. Scip., I,
21, 9), the climate of Egypt is conducive to the study of the
heavens, that of Ethiopia, naturally, would be far more so.

and her cycle, the year by the sun and his revolution.
And they devised other inventions much greater than
these. For they divided the entire skye and the
other stars that are inerrant and fixed, and do never
move, into twelve segments for such as move: which
they styled “houses,’’ although they resemble living
creatures, each patterned after the figure of a
different kind, whereof some are sea-monsters, some
humans, some wild beasts, some volatiles, some
juments.
For this reason, indeed, the Aegyptian deities are
portrayed in various aspects.1 For it is not to be
supposed that all Aegyptians were wont to draw
prognosticks from all the twelve signs; but some
had one sign in use, others another. The ram is
reverenced by those who looked up unto Aries, fish
is not eaten by those who attached signality unto
Pisces, the goat is not slain by those who had know-
ledge of Capricorn, and the other creatures are
_severally venerated by other folk. Assuredly the
bull too is adored in honour of the celestial Taurus,
and Apis, esteemed by them an object of the utter-
most sanctity, depastureth their land, and they that
inhabit it vouchsafe him an oracle in token of the
auspiciality of Taurus.
Not long after, the Libyans also espoused the
science; for the Libyan oracle of Ammon was founded
in regard of the heavens and his knowledge thereof;
1 In accrediting the invention of the signs of the Zodiac
to the Egyptians, our author is at one with his contemporaries
(cf. Macrobius, loc. cit.), but in deriving from these signs the
animal forms of the Egyptian gods, and in connecting the fish-
taboo in that country with the constellation Pisces he presents
the results of original research.

1 In the Goddesse of Surrye (2) Lucian is similarly minded
as to Babylonian claims of priority in religion; and in the
Runaways Philosophy goes successively to India, Ethiopia,
Egypt, Babylon, and Greece.
2 It seems better established that Atlas was the first
astronomer; cf. Cicero, 7’usc. Disp., V, 3, 8, and Vergil, Aen.,
I, 740. He taught the doctrine of the sphere to Heracles,
and the fact that Heracles introduced it into Greece underlies

whence they represent Ammon with a ram’s head.
And the Babylonians came to know all these things,
even before the others, as they themselves say; but
I think that the science reached them long after-
ward.!
As for the Greeks, they learned not a whit of
astrology either from the Aethiopians or from the
Aegyptians. It was Orpheus, the son of Oeagrus and
Calliope, that first declared these matters unto them,
but not at all plainly, nor did he bring the science
forth unto illucidation but unto ingannation and pious
fraude, such being the humour of the man.?_ For he
made a harp and exposed his mystick rites in poesy
and his theology in song; and the harp, that had
seven chords, discoursed the harmony of the errant
spheres. It was by investigating and ventilating
these matters that he enchanted and enthralled all
creatures; for he regarded not that harp of his nor
yet concerned himselfe with other musick, but this
was the mightie harp of Orpheus,’ and to honour
these things, the Greeks set apart a station in the
heavens and numerous stars are denominated
Orpheus his harp.
If ever you see Orpheus pictured in mosaick stones
or in pigment, he sitteth in the centre, in the simili-
the story of the golden apples of the Hesperides—so, at all
events, says Diodorus. Orpheus, however, was no doubt a
very active person in many ways; e.g. in connection with
philosophy (Runaways, 8) and very likely dancing (Dance, 15),
and the mathematician Nicomachus of Gerasa (pp. 241, 271,
274 Jan.), Lucian’s contemporary, agrees with him that the
lyre of Orpheus had seven strings to match the number of the
planets and played the harmony of the spheres.
3 The thought is that the planets form the only musical
instrument and render the only music in which Orpheus,
as primarily an astronomer, had any real interest.

1 Here again we have ‘‘ indepeniiont thought.” A widely
variant explanation of the myth had previously been offered
by Cephalio (cf. J. Malalas, Chron., p. 40, 1, in the Bonn
ition), according to which Tiresias was a student of
356

<note type="head">ASTROLOGY</head>
tude of one that sings, holding in his hands the harp,
and about him stand numberless creatures, among
which a bull, a man, a lion, and others after their
kind. When you see these, bethink you, pray, what
his song was, what his harp, and what the bull or
the lion that giveth ear to him. And if you would
know the originalls that I speak of, you may behold
each of them in the heavens.
They say, moreover, that Tiresias, a Boeotian
man, whose fame as touching prophecie is greatly
cried up, declared, unto the Greeks that of the errant
stars some are masle, some female, and that they
do not engender like effects; wherefore they fable
that Tiresias himself was bisexous and amphibious,
now masle, now female.!
When Atreus and Thyestes contended for the
throne of their fathers, even then, it is plain, the
Greeks set great store by astrologie and celestial
lore; and the commonwealth of Argos determined
that which ever of them was more excellent than the
other in this lore should bear rule. Thereupon
Thyestes indicated and made manifest unto them the
Ram in the heavens, in consequence whereof they
fable that Thyestes had a golden lamb. But Atreus
declared the doctrine of the sun and its risings, that
the sun and the First Movable? do not course in the
same direction, but rowle contrariwise to one another
medicine who concerned himself with the mysteries of
parturition.
2 The firmament, or orb, of the fixed stars. This was
thought of as revolving from East to West. The sun partici-
ted, to be sure, in its motion, but had a contrary motion of
is own, which was compared to that of an ant walking on the
rim of a moving wheel in the direction contrary to the wheel’s
motion.

1 Previous authors left this topic to Lucian “ incomplete.”
That Atreus owed his kingship to his discovery of the retrograde
motion of the sun was known not only to Polybius (XXXIV,
358
<pb n="359"/>
<note type="head">ASTROLOGY</head>
and that which now seemeth his setting, being a
setting of the First Movable, is a rising of the sun.
At his saying this, the men of Argos made him their
king, and great renown for learning became his.!
Concerning Bellerophon also I am of this opinion:
that he had a volatile as horse I do not at all believe,
but conceive that he pursued this wisdom and raised
his thoughts on high and held conversation with the
stars, and thus ascended unto heaven by means
not of his horse but of his wit.
The same may be said of Phrixus, the son of
Athamas, that is fabled to have ridden through the
ayr upon a golden ram. And certainly of Daedalus
the Athenian; although his story be strange, yet
methinks it is not without relation unto astrology, but
rather he practised it constantly himself and taught
it unto his son. But because Icarus was governed
by youth and audacity, and sought not the attainable
but let his minde carry him into the zenith, he came
short of truth and defected from reason and was
precipitated into a sea of unfathomable perplexities.
But the Greeks tell an idle myth of him and loosely
call a golfe of their sea Icarian after his name.
Doubtless Pasiphae also, hearing from Daedalus
of the Bull that appeareth amongst the constellations
and of Astrology itself, fell in love with the doctrine ;
beginning) but even to Sophocles and Euripides, according
es enter on arate (Achilleus: Maass, Comm.
in Arat., p. 28). It remained for Lucian to point out that
Thyestes was an astronomer also, the discoverer of the
constellation Aries, and to add a touch of paradox to the other
doctrine with his suggestion that inasmuch as the sun’s proper
motion is from West to East, he is really going upward,
and therefore rising, when he sets, and downward, or setting,
when he rises. : ;

whence they derive the belief that Daedalus con-
joined her in wedlock with the bull.1
Again, there be-those who, dissecting the science
into parts, have made different discoveries, some
collecting the particulars of the moon, some those of
Jupiter, and some those of the sun, concerning their
course and motion and potency. So Endymion
established the motions of the moon,? so Phaeton
inferred the course of the sun; yet not strictly, but
left the theory incompleat at his death. Ignorant
of this, men believe that Phaeton was Helius his son,
and they relate a story of him that is not at all
credible. Going, say they, unto Helius, his father,
he asked to drive the car of light; whiche he suffered
him to do, and also instructed him in the manner
of its governance. But when Phaeton mounted the
car, because of youth and inexpertness he drove
now close to earth, now at a vast remove; and men
were being destroyed both by cold and by heat that
passed endurance. Thereupon, Jupiter in wrath smote
Phaeton with a great bolt of lightning. After his
fall his sisters surrounding him made great dole until
they transmuted themselves, and now they are trees
of black poplar and distil amber over him in place of
tears. These things were not so, and it consisteth
not with piety to believe in them; Helius begat no
son, and no son of his perished.
1 The reader will not fail to note how neatly this explanation
of the Pasiphae myth puts a colophon upon Lucian’s masterly
treatment of the flight-legends, which is entirely his own.
2 We are indebted to Germanicus, in his commentary on
Aratus, for the information that Mnaseas of Sicyon credited
Endymion with the discovery of the course of the moon.
Having found the key to the flight-legends, it was easy for
Lucian to supply a pendant to Endymion in Phaethon.

But the Greeks relate many other fabulosities—
which I do not credit at all. For how doth it consist
with piety to believe that Aeneas was the’son of
Venus, Minos of Jupiter, Ascalaphus of Mars, or
Autolycus of Mercury? Nay, these were each and
all divinely favoured, and at their birth one of them
was under the regard of Venus, another of Jupiter,
another of Mars. For what powers soever are in
their proper houses at the moment of birth into this
life, those powers like unto parents make men
answerable to them in all respects, in complexion,
in figure, in workes, and in humour. So Minos
became a king because Jupiter was in his ascendancy,
Aeneas fair by the will of Venus, and Autolycus a
theef, whose theevery came to him from Mercury.
Moreover, it is not true, neither, that Jupiter put
Saturn in chaines or threw him into Tartarus or other-
wise mistreated him as men credit. Nay, Saturn
moveth in the extream orbe, far away from us, and
his motion is sluggish and not easy to be apprehended
ocularly by human kind, whence they say that he
holdeth still as if fettered ; and the vast abyss of the
ayr is called Tartarus.
’Tis chiefly from the verses of Homer the poet and
of Hesiod that we may learn that antiquity holdeth
with the astrologers. When he describeth the chain
of Jupiter! and the kine of the Sun, which I con-
heaven and all the other gods and ni agi should lay hold
of it, they could not pull him down, but he could pull them up,
along with the earth and the sea, fasten the chain about the
peak of Olympus, and leave everything hanging. Socrates in
the Theaetetus, 153 a, says that by the golden chain Homer
means nothing else than the sun; others, according to
Hysteria (695, 9), took him to mean the orbits of the
planets.

ceive to be daies,! and the cities that Vulcan made
upon the shield, and the choir, and the vineyard?...
All that he hath said of Venus and of Mars his
passion, is also manifestly composed from no other
source than this science. Indeed, it is the conjunc-
tion of Venus and Mars that createth the poetry of
Homer. And in other verses he distinguished the
duties of each, saying unto Venus,
“* Nay, be it thine to control the delightsome duties
of wedlock,”
and anent those of warfare,
“ These shall all be the care of impetuous Mars and
Minerva.” 3
Discerning all these things, the ancients had divina-
tion in very great use and counted it no parergy, but
would found no cities, invest themselves with no
ramparts, slay no men, wed no women, untill they
had been advised in all particulars by diviners. And
certainly their oracles were not aloof from astrology,
but at Delphi a virgin hath the office of prophet
in token of the celestial Virgin, and a serpent
giveth voice beneath the tripod because a Serpent
giveth light among the stars, and at Didymi also
the oracle of Apollo hath its name, methinks, from
the heavenly Twins.*
Lucian’s allegorical explanation. It is easy to see that the
chorus would be the planetary song and dance (cf. Dance,
§ 7), but the astronomical significance of the cities and the
vineyard is just a bit obscure.
3 Tliad, V, 429, 430.
« Modern philology soberly rejects the happy thought that
Didyma (Dids i) owes its name to the constellation Didymi
(Gemini), and explains that the name is Carian, like Idyma,
Sidyma, Loryma, etc. (Birchner, in Pauly-Wissowa, 3.v.).

So firmly did they believe divination a thing most
sacred, that when Ulysses, wearied of wandering,
took a phansie to learn the truth as touching his
affaires, he went off unto Hell, not ‘‘ to behold dead
men and a land that is joyless,’’ 1 but because he would
come to speech with Tiresias. And when he was
come to the place whereunto Circe directed him, and
had dug his pit and slain his sheep, although many dead
that were by, and amongst them his own mother,
were fain to drink of the blood, he suffered none of
them, not even his very mother, until he had wet the
throstle of Tiresias and constrained him to deliver
the prophecy, verily enduring to behold his mother’s
shadow athirst.
For the Spartans, Lycurgus drew from the skye his
ordering of their whole polity and made it their law
never to leave their country, even to go to the wars,
before the moon should be at her full, for he conceited
that the potency of the moon is not the same when
she waxeth and when she waneth, and that all things
are subject unto her sway. The Arcadians, however,
and none but they, would have naught of this and
yeelded no honour unto astrologie ; and in their folly
they affirm that they are older than the moon.
Whereas our forbears were so mightily enamoured
of divination, among this generation there be some
who say that it is an impossibility for mankind to
conceive a useful purpose of astrologie. It is neither
credible, say they, nor truthful, and Mars and Jupiter
do not move in the skye for our sake, but are nothing

at all solicitous of the affairs of men, wherewith
they have naught in common, but accomplish their
courses independently, through a necessitude of re-
volving. And others affirm that astrologie, although
not untruthful, is unprofitable, insomuch as divina-
tion will not alter that which draweth nigh by decree
of the fates.1
To both these opinions I may answer that although
the stars do verily absolve their own course in the
skye, none the less as a parergy or incidental of their
motion each event among us cometh to pass. Or
will you have it that although if a horse run or
birds or humans move, pebbles are flung up and
strawes set astir by the wind of their motion, yet the
gyration of the stars bringeth naught else to pass?
And that whereas from a little fire an effluxion cometh
to us, although the fire burneth not for our sake at all
and is not a whit sollicitous that we be warmed, yet
from the stars we receive no effluxion whatever?
Furthermore, astrologie is indeed impotent to con-
vert bad into good, or to effect mutation in any of the
effluents, yet is it profitable to those that employ
it, in so much as the good, when they know that it is
to come, delighteth them long beforehand, while the
bad they accept readily, for it cometh not upon them
unawares, but in vertue of contemplation and expect-
ance is deemed easie and light. That is my opinion
in the matter of astrology.
1 Among those who so argue is Lucian’s Cyniscus in Zeus
Catechized, 12-14 (II, 76f).

1 As Lucian explains below (12-13), an apophras hémera,
or ‘‘nefandous day,’’ like a dies nefastus among the Latins,
was a day of ill-omen on which no courts were held and no
business affairs transacted. But the fact that a day can be
called apophras does not in itself justify calling a man a: 1as,
particularly as the word is of the feminine gender; and that is

<head>THE MISTAKEN CRITIC, OR A DISCOURSE ON THE WORD
NEFANDOUS<note><p>A personal attack resembling the Professor of Rhetoric
and the Ignorant Book-Collector, but outdoing both of them in
savagery. Its motive was not so much to show up a vicious
citizen as to avenge a personal insult. In passing the man,
Lucian had expressed his opinion of him loudly enough to be
overheard (which was doubtless his intention). He used a
word that as an epithet was obsolete, and not conspicuously
sanctioned by good use. Consequently, the man laughed, and
ridiculed his language, which was a fatal mistake; for Lucian,
always sensitive about his diction, as witness his On a Slip of the
Tongue in Salutation (Vol. VI), was thereby provoked to pay
him back with interest.</p>
<p>For raw, unsparing satire like this, Lucian had plenty of pre-
cedent not only in the iambics of Archilochus and Semonides,
to which, with the scazons of Hipponax, he himself alludes,
and in Old Comedy, but in melic poetry (not only Timocreon
of Rhodes, but Anacreon). Of its use in the orators, where
it conspicuously serves ulterior purposes, Aeschines against
Timarchus is the classic example. After the orators it was the
Cynics, particularly the street-corner type, who kept the
tradition of outspokenness alive; Lucian’s Demonax is full
of illustrations.</p>
<p>That the name of Lucian’s victim was Timarchus is, I
think, an erroneous assumption from the nickname Atimarchus
that was given him at Athens (§27; see the note there),
He had been an actor and a teacher, and was then a sophist.
A Syrian by birth, he had lived in Antioch, Egypt, Italy, and
Greece. The piece was written soon after the incident
occurred, apparently in Ephesus, where the sophist was then
living. There is nothing in its content to fix its date.</p></note></head>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="1"><p>


That you did not know the word nefandous is
surely cleartoeveryone. When I had said of you that
you were like a nefandous day—for I well remember
comparing your character to a day of that kind !—
how could you, with reference to that word, have
made the stricture that I was barbarous in my speech,
unless you were wholly unacquainted withit? Ishall
teach you presently what nefandous means ;_ but I say
to you now what Archilochus once said: ‘‘ You have
caught a cicada by the wing.” ? Have you ever
heard of a writer of iambic verses named Archilochus,
a Parian by birth, a man absolutely independent and
given to frankness, who did not hesitate at all to use
insulting language, no matter how much pain he was
what Lucian obviously did (cf. § 16, and especially § 23).
It might have been defended by citing the comedian Eupolis
(Fr. Incert., 832M., 309K.): ‘On going out, I chanced to
meet a wight nefandous (avOpwaos dmod¢pds) with a fickle
eye.’’ Either Lucian did not know the passage, or perhaps
he thought that to reply in that way would be too like a
Lexiphanes. Anyhow, he elected to infuriate his critic
and divert his public by being transparently disingenuous
and mendacious, and entirely evading the real issue. What
his talk of ‘‘ comparing ’’ amounts to is commented on in the
note on § 16.

1 See G. L. Hendrickson, ‘‘ Archilochus and Catullus,’’

he is able to identify the poem from which Lucian quotes with
the one from which we have the fragment addressed to

going to inflict upon those who would be exposed to
the gall of his iambics? Well, when he was abused
by someone of that type, he said that the man had
caught a cicada by the wing, likening himself,
Archilochus, to the cicada, which by nature is
vociferous, even without any compulsion, but when
it is caught by the wing, cries out still more lustily.
“ Unlucky man,” said he, “ what is your idea in
provoking against yourself a vociferous poet, in search
of motives and themes for his iambics? ”’!
In these same terms I threaten you, not likening
myself to Archilochus (how could I? I am far indeed
from that!), but aware that you have done in your
life hundreds of things which deserve iambics. Even
Archilochus himself, I think, would not have been
able to cope with them, though he invited both
Simonides ? and Hipponax to take a hand with him
in treating just one of your bad traits, so childish in
every sort of iniquity have you made Orodocides and
Lycambes and Bupalus,? their butts, appear. Prob-
ably it was one of the gods who brought the smile to
your lips on that occasion at my use of the word
nefandous, in order that you might become more
notorious than a Scythian for being absolutely
uneducated and ignorant of these obvious matters of
common knowledge, and that you might afford a
reasonable excuse for attacking you to an independent
‘* Father Lycambes ” (Bergk, 88), and to reconstruct part of
the context.
2 Of Amorgos; his name is sometimes spelt Semonides, but
not in the MSS of Lucian.
3 Orodocides was evidently the butt of Semonides; this
is the only reference to him, and the name is not wholly
certain (Horodoecides N). Lycambes was satirised by Archi-
lochus, and Bupalus by Hipponax.

man who knows you thoroughly from home and will
not refrain from telling—I should say, heralding
abroad—all that you do by night and by day even
now, in addition to those many incidents of your
ast.
P And yet it is idle, no doubt, and superfluous to deal
frankly with you by way of education; for in the first
place you yourself could never improve in response
to my censure, any more than a tumble-bug could be
persuaded not to roll those balls of his any longer,
when once he has become used to them.? In the
second place, I do not believe that anyone exists who
still is ignorant of your brazen performances and of
the sins that you, an old man, have committed
against yourself. You are not to that extent secure
or unobserved in your iniquity. There is no need of
anyone to strip away your lion’s skin that you may
be revealed a donkey, unless perhaps someone has
just come to us from the Hyperboreans, or is suffi-
ciently Cymaean? not to know, as soon as he sees you,
that you are the most unbridled of all asses, without
waiting to hear you bray. Your doings have been
noised abroad so long a time, so far ahead of me,
so universally and so repeatedly; and you have no
slight reputation for them, surpassing Ariphrades,
surpassing the Sybarite Hemitheon, surpassing the
notorious Chian, Bastas, that adept in similar
matters.3
Nevertheless, I must speak of them, even if I shall
(or Minthon ; see the critical note) is alluded to as the author of
an obscene book in the Ignorant Book-Collector, 23 (III, 203)
and perhaps also in Ovid (Trist., II, 417 : qui composuit nuper
Sybaritica), but the name is not given there. Bastas was a
nickname applied to Democritus of Chios, a musician, by
Eupolis in the Baptae (Fr. 81 Kock).

seem to be telling stale news, in order that I may
not bear the blame of being the only one who does
not know about them. Butno! We must callin one
of Menander’s Prologues, Exposure, a god devoted
to Truth and Frankness, by no means the least notable
of the characters that appear on the stage, disliked
only by you and your sort, who fear his tongue because
he knows everything and tells in plain language all
that he knows about you.! It would indeed be
delightful if he should prove willing to oblige us by
coming forward and telling the spectators the entire
argument of the play.
Come then, Exposure, best of prologues and divini-
ties, take care to inform the audience plainly that we
have not resorted to this public utterance gratui-
tously, or in a quarrelsome spirit, or, as the proverb has
it, with unwashen feet,” but to vindicate a grievance
of our own as well as those of the public, hating the
man for his depravity. Say only this, and present a
clear exposition, and then, giving us your blessing,
take yourself off, and leave the rest to us, for we shall
copy you and expose the greater part of his career so
thoroughly that in point of truth and frankness you
can find no fault with us. But do not sing my praises
to them, Exposure dear, and do not prematurely
pour out the bald truth about these traits of his; for
it is not fitting, as you are a god, that the words which
describe matters so abominable should come upon
your lips.

to those who should attend the festival a speech
which he had written long before. The subject of
his composition was the exclusion of Pythagoras (by
one of the Athenians, I suppose) from participation
in the Eleusinian mysteries as a barbarian, because
Pythagoras himself was in the habit of saying that
before being Pythagoras he had once been Euphor-
bus.! In truth, his speech was after the pattern of
Aesop’s jackdaw, cobbled up out of motley feathers
from others. Wanting, of course, to have it thought
that he was not repeating a stale composition but
making up offhand what really came from his book,
he requested one of his familiars (it was the one from
Patras, who has so much business in the courts) to
select Pythagoras for him when he asked for subjects
to talk about. The man did so, and prevailed upon
the audience to hear that speech about Pythagoras.
In the sequel, he was very unconvincing in his
delivery, glibly reciting (as was natural) what he had
thought out long before and learned by heart, no
matter how much his shamelessness, standing by
him, defended him, lent him ahelping hand, and aided
him in the struggle. There was a great deal of
laughter from his hearers, some of whom, by looking
from time to time at that man from Patras, indicated
that they had not failed to detect his part in the
improvisation, while others, recognising the expres-
sions themselves, throughout the performance con-
tinued to have that as their sole occupation, testing
each other to find out how good their memories were
at distinguishing which one of those sophists who
achieved fame a little before our time for their
1 Euphorbus was one of Homer’s Trojans. See Lucian’s
Cock, 13, 17, and 20 (II, pp. 204-214).

so-called ‘‘ exercises” was the author of each
expression.
“ Among all these, among those who laughed, was
the writer of these words. And why should not he
laugh at a piece of cheek so manifest and unconvinc-
ing and shameless? So, somehow or other, being one
who cannot control his laughter, when the speaker had
attuned his voice to song, as he thought, and was
intoning a regular dirge over Pythagoras, our
author, seeing an ass trying to play the lyre, as the
saying goes, burst into a very melodious cachinnation,
and the other turned and saw him. That created a
state of war between them, and the recent affair
sprang from it. It was the beginning of the year, or
rather, the second day after the New Year,! the day
on which the Romans, by an ancient custom, make
prayers in person for the entire yearand holdsacrifices,
following ceremonies which King Numaestablished for
them; they are convinced that on that day beyond
all others the gods give ear to those who pray. Well,
on that festival and high holiday, the man who burst
out laughing then in Olympia at the suppositious
Pythagoras saw this contemptible cheat approaching,
this presenter of the speeches of others. It happened
that he knew his character, too, and all his wanton-
ness and unclean living, both what he was said to do,
and what he had been caught doing. So he said to
1 New Year’s Day is called in the Greek “‘ the great New-
Moon-Day.”? The day of the festival on which the incident
occurred was January third (a.d. III non. Ian.) For the vow
of the consuls on that day, two gilded bulls for the health of
the Imperial family, see Henzen, Acta Fratrum Arvalium,
pp. 100-102.

one of his friends: ‘We must give a wide berth to
this ill-met sight, whose appearance is likely to make
the most delightful of all days nefandous for us.’ +
“ On hearing that, the sophist at once laughed at
the word nefandous as if it were strange and alien to
the Greeks, and paid the man back, in his own
estimation, at least, for the laughter of that former
time, saying to all: ‘Nefandous! What, pray, is
that? A fruit, or a herb, or a utensil? Can it be
something to eat ordrink? For my part I have never
heard the word, and should never be able to guess
what it means.’ He thought he was directing these
remarks at our friend, and he subjected ‘ nefandous ’
to a great deal of laughter; but he had unwittingly
brought against himself the uttermost proof of his
want of education. Under these circumstances he
who sent me in to you in advance has written this
composition to demonstrate that the renowned
sophist does not know expressions common to all
the Greeks, which even men in the workshops and
the bazaars would know.”
Thus far Exposure. In my own turn (for I myself
have now taken over the rest of the show), I might
fittingly play the part of the Delphic tripod and tell
what you did in your own country, what in Palestine,
what in Egypt, what in Phoenicia and Syria; then,
in due order, in Greece and Italy, and on top of it all,
what you are now doing at Ephesus, which is the
extremity of your recklessness and the culminating
clearly to exasperate Lucian’s victim rather than to impose
upon his public. To say that a man’s appearance would make
the day apophras is not saying that he was “‘ like that kind of
day,’’ let alone calling him apophras. See the note on § 1,
above, and that on § 16, below.

point and crowning glory of your character. Now
that, in the words of the proverb,’ you who live in
Troy have paid to see tragedians, it is a fitting
occasion for you to hear your own misadventures.
But no! not yet. First about that ‘ nefandous.’
Tell me, in the name of Aphrodite Pandemus and
the Genetyllides* and Cybebe, in what respect did
you think the word nefandous objectionable and fit to
be laughed at? Oh, because it did not belong to the
Greeks, but had somehow thrust its way in among
them from their intercourse with Celts or Thracians
or Scyths; wherefore you—for you know everything
that pertains to the Athenians—excluded it at once
and banished it from the Greek world, and your
laughter was because I committed a barbarism and
used a foreign idiom and went beyond the Attic
bounds !
““Come now, what else is as well established on
Athenian soil as that word? ’’ people would say who
are better informed than you about such matters.
It would be easier for you to prove Erechtheus and
Cecrops foreigners and invaders of Attica, than to
show that ‘ nefandous ’ is not at home and indigenous
in Attica. There are many things which they de-
signate in the same way as everybody else, but they,
and they alone, designate as nefandous a day which
is vile, abominable, inauspicious, useless, and like
you. There now! I have already taught you in
passing what they mean by nefandous!
and was of foreign origin. But in Attica, where she was wor-
shipped in the temple of another similar divinity, Colias,
the identities of the two were apparently so thoroughly
merged that they could both be called either Genetyllides or
Coliades, and both were more or less blended with Aphrodite.

When official business is not transacted, introduc-
tion of lawsuits is not permissible, sacrifice of victims
is not performed, and, in general, nothing is done
that requires good omens, that day is nefandous.
The custom was introduced among different peoples
in different ways; either they were defeated in great
battles and subsequently established that those days
on which they had undergone such misfortunes
should be useless and invalid for their customary trans-
actions, or, indeed—but it is inopportune, perhaps,
and by now unseasonable to try to alter an old
man’s education and reinstruct him in such matters
when he does not know even what precedes them.!
It can hardly be that this is all that remains, and that
if you learn it, we shall have you fully informed!
Nonsense, man! Not to know those other expressions
which are off the beaten path and obscure to ordinary
folk is pardonable ; but even if you wished, you could
not say nefandous in any other way, for that is every-
one’s sole and only word for it.
“‘ Well and good,’’ someone will say, ‘‘ but even in
the case of time-honoured words, only some of them
are to be employed, and not others, which are
unfamiliar to the public, that we may not disturb the
wits and wound the ears of our hearers.’’ My dear
sir, perhaps as far as you are concerned I was wrong
to say that to you about yourself; yes, yes, I should
have followed the folk-ways of the Paphlagonians or
the Cappadocians or the Bactrians in conversing with
you, that you might fully understand what was being
said and it might be pleasing to your ears. But
Greeks, I take it, should be addressed in the Greek
tongue. Moreover, although even the Athenians in

course of time have made many changes in their
speech, this word especially has continued to be used
in this way always and by all of them.
I should have named those who have employed
the word before our time, were I not certain to
disturb you in this way also, by reciting names of
poets and rhetoricians and historians that would be
foreign to you, and beyond your ken. No, I shall not
name those who have used it, for they are known to
all; but do you point me out one of the ancients who
has not employed the word and your statue shall be
set up, as the saying goes, in gold at Olympia.
Indeed, any old man, full of years, who is unacquainted
with such expressions is not, I think, even aware
that the city of Athens is in Attica, Corinth at the
Isthmus, and Sparta in the Peloponnese.
It remains, perhaps, for you to say that you knew
the word, but criticised the inappropriate use of it.
Come now, on this point too I shall respond to you
fittingly, and you must pay attention, unless not
knowing matters very little to you. The ancients
were before me in hurling many such taunts at the
like of you, each at the men of their day; for in that
time too there were, of course, dirty fellows, disgust-
ing traits, and ungentle dispositions. One man
called a certain person “ Buskin,’’ comparing his
principles, which were adaptable, to that kind of
footwear ; another called a man “‘ Rampage”’ because
he was a turbulent orator and disturbed the assembly,
and another someone else ‘‘ Seventh Day ”’ because
he acted in the assemblies as children do on the

1 The nickname ‘‘ Buskin’”’ was given to Theramenes.
‘* Seventh Day ” cannot be identified, and the other nickname
is corrupted in the Greek text.
2 Stripped of its manifest disingenuousness (for comparison
includes both simile and metaphor, and the use of simile
would have been entirely unexceptionable), this amounts to
defending what he said as Ry legitimate use of metaphor,
like calling a man “ Buskin.’? The argument would be valid
if he had called the man ‘‘ Apophras hémera!’’ But since
we may safely say that he addressed him or spoke about him

seventh day of the month, joking and making fun
and turning the earnestness of the people into jest.!
Will you not, then, in the name of Adonis, permit
me to compare an utterly vile fellow, familiar with
every form of iniquity, to a disreputable and in-
auspicious day ??
We avoid those who are lame in the right foot,
especially if we should see them early in the morn-
ing; and if anyone should see a cut priest or a eunuch
or a monkey immediately upon leaving the house,
he returns upon his tracks and goes back, auguring
that his daily business for that day will not be
successful, thanks to the bad and inauspicious omen
at the start. But in the beginning of the whole year,
at its door, on its first going forth, in its early morn-
ing, if one should see a profligate who commits and
submits to unspeakable practices, notorious for it,
broken in health, and all but called by the name of
his actions themselves, a cheat, a swindler, a perjurer,
a pestilence, a pillory, a pit,? will not one shun him,
will not one compare him to a nefandous day ?
Well, are you not such a person? You will not
deny it, if I know your boldness; indeed, it seems to
me that you are actually vain over the fact that you
simply as ‘‘ apophras,’’ the examples are not parallel, despite
the speciousness of ‘‘ hebdomas ’’ (‘‘ Seventh Day ’’), formally
identical with ‘‘ apophras.’’ The one locution, however,
is metaphor, because ‘‘day’’ is understood; in the other,
that is not the case, and instead of metaphor what we have to
do with is an application of the adjective grammatically
incorrect and really justifiable only by pleading previous
use—which might have been done by adducing Eupolis (see
$1, note).
3 That is to say, approximately, a whipping-stock, a gallows-
bird; hurling into a pit was a form of capital punishment in
many cities of Greece.

1 This man played parts like that of the Odysseus who,
as we are told in The Dance, § 83, had his head broken by the
pantomimic dancer who was enacting Ajax gone mad. Such
parts did not involve dancing (cf. daoxplywy, above), but
were not silent—a point made perfectly clear by another allu-
sion to them in § 25 of this piece. Three of the réles in which

have not lost the glory of your exploits, but are
conspicuous to all and have made a great noise. If,
however, you should offer opposition and should deny
that you are such a person, who will believe what you
say? The people of your native city (for it is fitting
to begin there)? No, they knew about your first
source of livelihood, and how you gave yourself over
to that pestilential soldier and shared his depravity,
serving him in every way until, after reducing you
to a torn rag, as the saying goes, he thrust you out.
And of course they remember also the effrontery that
you displayed in the theatre, when you acted second-
ary parts for the dancers and thought you were leader
of the company.1 Nobody might enter the theatre
before you, or indicate the name of the play ; you were
sent in first, very properly arrayed, wearing golden
sandals and the robe of a tyrant, to beg for favour
from the audience, winning wreaths and making your
exit amid applause, for already you were held in
esteem by them. But now you are a public speaker
and a lecturer! So those people, if ever they hear
such a thing as that about you, believe they see two
suns, as in the tragedy,? and twin cities of Thebes,
and everyone is quick to say, “That man who
then—, and after that—?’’ Therefore you do well
in not going there at all or living in their neighbour-
hood, but of your own accord remaining in exile from
your native city, thoughit is neither “ bad in winter ”’
not “ oppressive in summer,’’® but the fairest and
Lucian’s butt appeared are named there; Ninus, Metiochus,
and Achilles. See the note on that passage.

largest of all the cities in Phoenicia. To be put to
the proof, to associate with those who know and
remember your doings of old, is truly as bad as a
halter in your sight. And yet, why do I make that
' silly statement? What would you consider shame-
ful, of all that goes beyond the limit? I am told
that you have a great estate there—that ill-con-
ditioned tower, to which the jar of the man of Sinope !
would be the great hall of Zeus !
In view of all this, you can never by any means
persuade your fellow-citizens not to think you the
most odious man in the world, a common disgrace to
the whole city. Could you, though, perhaps win over
the other inhabitants of Syria to vote for you if you
said that you had done nothing bad or culpable in
your life? Heracles! Antioch was an eye-witness
of your misconduct with that youth from Tarsus whom
you took aside—but to unveil these matters is no
doubt shameful for me. However, it is known about
and remembered by those who surprised the pair of
you then and saw him doing—you know what, unless
you are absolutely destitute of memory.
Well, perhaps people in Egypt do not know you,
who received you when, after those marvellous per-
formances of yours in Syria, you went into exile for
the reasons which I have mentioned, pursued by the
clothiers, from whom you had bought costly garments
and in that way obtained your expense-money for the
journey. But Alexandria knows you to be guilty of
offences just as bad, and should not have been ranked
second to Antioch. No, your wantonness there was
more open and your licentiousness more insane, your

reputation for these things was greater, and your
head was uncloaked under all circumstances.1
There is only one person who would have believed
you if you denied having done anything of the sort,
and would have come to your assistance—your latest
employer, one of the first gentlemen of Rome. The
name itself you will allow me to withhold, especially
in addressing people who all know whom I mean.
As to all the liberties taken by you while you were
with him that he tolerated, why should I speak of
them? But when he found you in the company of
his young cup-bearer Oenopion,—what do you think ?
Would he have believed you? Not unless he was
completely blind. No, he made his opinion evident by
’ driving you out of his house at once, and indeed con-
ducting a lustration, they say, after your departure.
And certainly Greece as well as Italy is completely
filled with-your doings, and your reputation for them,
and I wish you joy of your fame! . Consequently, to
those who marvel at what you are now doing in
Ephesus, I say (and it is true as can be) that they
would not wonder if they knew your early perform-
ances. Yet you have learned something new here
having to do with women.
Does it not, then, fit such a man to a hair to call him
nefandous? But why in the name of Zeus should you
take it upon yourselfto kiss us after such performances ?
In so doing you behave very offensively, especially
to those who ought least of all to be so treated, your
pupils, for whom it would have been enough to get
only those other horrid boons from your lips—bar-
barity of language, harshness of voice, indistinctness,

1 Except for rhesimeter (to speak for a measured time,
as in court), which Lucian’s Lexiphanes uses (Lez., 9), these
words are found only here. Their meaning is :
bromologous : stench-mouthed.
tropomasthletes: oily-mannered fellows.
athenio: to yearn for Athens.

confusedness, complete tunelessness, and the like,
but to kiss you—forfend it, Averter of Ill! Better
kiss an asp or a viper; then the risk is a bite and a
pain which the doctor cures when you call him. But
from the venom of your kiss, who could approach
victims or altars? What god would listen to one’s
prayer? How many bowls of holy water, how many
rivers are required?
And you, who are of that sort, laughed at others in
the matter of words and phrases, when you were doing
such terrible deeds! For my part, had I not known
the word nefandous, I should have been ashamed, so
far am I from denying that I used it. In your own
case, none of us criticised you for saying ‘‘ bromo-
logous ”’ and “ tropomasthletes ’’ and “to rhesi-
meter,” and “ Athenio,’’ and “ anthocracy ’’ and
“‘sphendicise’’ and ‘“‘cheiroblime.’’! May Hermes,
Lord of Language, blot you out miserably, language
and all, for the miserable wretch that you are!
Where in literature do you find these treasures?
Perhaps buried somewhere in the closet of some
composer of dirges, full of mildew and spiders’ webs,
or from the Tablets of Philaenis,? which you keep in
hand. For you, however, and for your lips they are
quite good enough.
anthocracy: apparently, rule of the ‘‘flower’’; i.e., the
select few.
sphendicise: to sling, very likely in the sense, to throw.
cheiroblime : to handle. ‘
2 The Tablets of Philaenis are frequently mentioned as
an ars amatoria. An epigram by Aeschrion (Anth. Pal.,
VII, 345) says that it was not written by the woman whose name
it bore, but by the sophist Polycrates. The book is therefore
of the time of Polycrates, the beginning of the fourth century
B.C.

Now that I have mentioned lips, what would you
say if your tongue, summoning you to court, let us
suppose, should prosecute you on a charge of injury
and at the mildest, assault, saying: ‘‘ Ingrate, I took
you under my protection when you were poor and
hard up and destitute of support, and first of all I
made you successful in the theatre, making you now
Ninus, now Metiochus, and then presently Achilles 1
After that, when you taught boys to spell, I kept you
for a long time; and wien at length you took to
delivering these speeches of yours, composed by other
people, I caused you to be considered a sophist,
attaching to you a reputation which had nothing at
all to do with you. What charge, then, have you to
bring against me, so great that you treat me in this
way, imposing disgraceful tasks and abominable
services? Are not my daily tasks enough, lying,
committing perjury, ladling out such an amount of
silliness and twaddle, or (I should say) spewing out
the nastiness of those speeches? Even at night you
do not allow me, unlucky that I am, to take my rest,
but unaided I do everything for you, am abused,
defiled, treated deliberately like a hand rather than
a tongue, insulted as if I were nothing to you, over-
whelmed with so many injuries. My only function
is to talk; other parts have been commissioned to do
such things as those. Oh if only someone had cut
me out, like the tongue of Philomela. More blessed
the fragments in 8. Gaselee, Daphnis and Chloe [L.C.L.];_ cf.
R. M. Rattenbury, New Chapters in the Hist. of Greek Lit.,
III, pp. 211-223). Opposite to his Metiochus the Phrygian,
the dancer played Parthenope; see The Dance, §1. His
Achilles was very likely that hero on Scyros, disguised as a
girl, with the dancer taking the part of the king’s daughter
whom he beguiled, Deidameia; cf. p. 257.

1 Timarchus is the man whom Aeschines castigated for his
vices in an extant speech. From the wording of this passage
it has been very generally inferred that the name of Lucian’s
butt was Timarchus. That, however, would be a singular

in my sight are the tongues of parents who have eaten
their children! ”’
In Heaven’s name, if your tongue should say that,
acquiring a voice of its own, and getting your beard
to join in the accusation, what response would you
make? The reply, manifestly, which you made
recently to Glaucus when he rebuked you just after a
performance, that by this means you had speedily
become famous and known to everyone, and how could
you have become so notorious by making speeches ?
It was highly desirable, you said, to be renowned and
celebrated in any way whatsoever. And then you
might tell it your many nicknames, acquired in
different nations. In that connection I marvel at it
that you were distressed when you heard ‘ nefandous ’
but were not angry over those names. In Syria you
were called Rhododaphne; the reason, by Athena,
I am ashamed to tell. So as far as lies in me, it will
still remain a mystery. In Palestine, you were
Thorn-hedge, with reference, no doubt, to the
prickling of your stubbly beard; for you still kept it
shaved. In Egypt you were called Quinsy, which is
clear. In fact, they say you were nearly throttled
when you ran afoul of a lusty sailor who closed with
you and stopped your mouth. The Athenians, ex-
cellent fellows that they are, gave you no enigmatic
name but called you Atimarchus, honouring you with
the addition of a single letter because you had to have
something that went even beyond Timarchus.1. And
in Italy—my word! you got that epic nickname of
coincidence, which would surely have called for especial
emphasis. All that Lucian intends to convey, I think, is that
the Athenians did not nickname the man Timarchus as they
might have done, but went a step further and styled him
Atimarchus.

Cyclops, because once, over and above your old bag
of tricks, you took a notion to do an obscene parody
on Homer’s poetry itself, and while you lay there,
drunk already, with a bowl of ivy-wood in your hand,
a lecherous Polyphemus, a young man whom you
had hired came at you as Odysseus, presenting his
bar, thoroughly made ready, to put out your eye;
‘“‘ And that he missed; his shaft was turned aside.
Its point drove through beside the jawbone’s
root.’’! :
(Of course it is not at all out of the way, in discussing
you, to be silly.) Well, you as the Cyclops, opening
your mouth and setting it agape as widely as you
could, submitted to having your jaw put out by him,
or rather, like Charybdis, you strove to engulf your
Noman whole, along with his crew, his rudder, and
his sails. That was seen by other people present.
Then the next day your only defence was drunken-
ness, and you sought sanctuary in the unwatered
wine.
Rich as you are in these choice and numerous
appellations, are you ashamed of ‘nefandous’? In
the name of the gods, tell me how you feel when
the rabble call you names derived from Lesbos and
Phoenicia?, Are you as unacquainted with these as

praising you? Or do you know these through old
acquaintance, and is it only ‘ nefandous’ that you scorn
as unknown and exclude from your list of names?
Consequently, you are paying us a penalty which
cannot be considered inadequate; no, your notoriety

1 The quaint conceit that with a trident all three might
be despatched at a blow undoubtedly embellished a rhetorical
“* exercise ’’ like Lucian’s own Tyrannicide or Disowned.

extends even to the women’s quarters. Recently,
for instance, when you had the hardihood to seek a
match in Cyzicus, that excellent woman, who had
very thoroughly informed herself in every particular
said: ‘I do not care to have a man who needs
one.”
Then, being in such case, you bother about words,
do you, and laugh, and insult other people? Not
without reason, for we could not all use expressions
like yours. How ever could we? Who is so greatly
daring in language as to ask for a trident instead of a
sword to use on three adulterers, as you did?! Or
to say of Theopompus, in passing judgement on his
Tricaranus,? that he had razed the outstanding cities
single-handed with a three-pronged book? And
again, that he had plied a ruinous trident upon Hellas,
and that he was a literary Cerberus.2 Why, the other
day you even lighted a lantern and went peering
about, for some “ brother,’’ I suppose, that had got
astray. And there are other examples beyond
counting, which it is not worth while to mention,
except for one that was heard and reported. A rich
man, I gather, and two poor men were on bad terms.
Then, in the middle of the story, speaking of the rich
man, you said: ‘‘ He killed @urepoy (meaning one of
the two, instead of saying rév érepov) ; and when those
present laughed, as was natural, by way of correcting
and undoing your slip you said: ‘‘ No, not that;
he killed drepov”’! Your old-time slips I pass over,
your use of the dual in speaking of three months, of
dvyvepin (for vnveuia, windlessness), of wérayac (for
méropat, I fly), of éxxdve (for éxxeiv, to pour out), and
all the other fine flowers that adorn your compositions.
® Cerberus had three heads.

<note type="head">THE MISTAKEN CRITIC</head>
As to what you do under the impulsion of poverty
—by our Lady of Necessity! I cannot censure a
single act. It can be overlooked, for example, if a
man in the pinch of hunger who has received moneys
entrusted to him by a man of his own city subse-
quently takes a false oath that he received nothing;
or if a man shamelessly asks for gifts—begs, in fact—
and steals and plies the trade of publican. That is
not what I am talking about; for there is nothing
invidious in fending off destitution by every means.
But it goes beyond what is endurable when you, a
poor man, pour the proceeds of your shamelessness
into such indulgences only. However, you will per-
mit me to praise one thing, anyhow, that very pretty
performance of yours when you yourself—and you
know it—composed the “ Tisias’ Handbook,”’ that
work of an ill-omened crow, thus robbing that stupid
old man of thirty gold pieces; for because of Tisias’
name he paid seven hundred and fifty drachmas for
the book, gulled into it by you.t
I have still a great deal that I might say; but I
willingly forego the rest for you, adding only this:
do as you like in everything else and do not cease to
indulge in such maudlin behaviour at your own
expense, but not that one thing—no, no! It is not
decent to ask people who so act to the same table, to
share a cup with them, and to partake of the same
food. And let there be none of this kissing after
lectures, either, especially with those who have made
‘nefandous’ apply to you not long before. And inas-
much as I have already begun to give friendly advice,
rhetoric, were said to have written handbooks. This pro-
duction, purporting to be by Tisias, was really the work of
an ill-omened Koraz (crow), thievish as such birds always are.

hair, and depilating only certain parts; for if some
ailment is besetting you, your whole body should be
attended to, but if nothing of that sort ails you, what
is the point of your making parts hairless, smooth,
and sleek which should not even be seen? One
thing only is prudent in you, your grey hairs, and
that you no longer dye them, so that you can have
them to cloak your iniquity. Spare them, in Heaven’s
name in this point also, and particularly your beard,
too; do not defile or mistreat it any longer. If
you must, let it be at night and in darkness; but
by day—no, no!—that is absolutely uncivilised and
beastly.
Do not you see that it would have been better for
you to “leave Camarina undisturbed,” and not to
laugh at the word nefandous, which is going to make
your whole life nefandous? Or is something more
still required? As far as in me lies, it shall not

too—that “glozing varlet’’—as if you had heard
something enigmatic and riddling; for you do not
know the words for your actions. So you now have

<head>THE PARLIAMENT OF THE GODS<note><p>This brief comic dialogue records the proceedings of an
assembly on Olympus in which steps are taken to purge the
celestial roster of aliens and interlopers. It has been called a
sequel to Zeus Rants because in that dialogue (§ 42: II, 154)
the caustic remarks of the infidel Damis about the odd gods
worshipped in various parts of the world force Zeus to admit
that Momus had been right in expecting all this to cause trouble
one day, and to promise that he would try to set everything
straight. It is to be noted, however, that in the Parliament of
the Gods there is not only no allusion, direct or indirect, to
Zeus Rants, but no suggestion that this purgation of the
body politic has any relation to hostile criticism on earth.
The connection, therefore, is not remarkably close. It is too
bad that Lucian has left us no record of the subsequent
proceedings before the committee on credentials. An account
of ae appearance of Mithras would have been particularly
welcome.</p></note></head>

MOMUS
Well then, I say that some of us behave shockingly ;
it is not enough for them that they themselves have
become gods instead of men, but unless they can
make their very attendants and servants as good as
we are, they do not think they have done anything
important or enterprising. And I beg you, Zeus, to
let me speak frankly, for I could not do otherwise.
Everybody knows how free of speech I am, and
disinclined to hush up anything at all that is ill done.
I criticize everybody and express my views openly,
without either fearing anyone or concealing my
opinion out of respect, so that most people think
me vexatious and meddling by nature; they call
me a regular public prosecutor. However, inasmuch
as it is according to law, and the proclamation has
been made, and you, Zeus, allow me to speak with
complete liberty, I shall do so, without any-
reservations.
Many, I say, not content that they themselves
take part in the same assemblies as we and feast
with us on equal terms, and that too when they are
half mortal, havelugged up into heaven their own
servants and boon-companions and have fraudulently
registered them, so that now they receive largesses
and share in sacrifices on an equal footing without
even having paid us the tax of resident aliens.
ZEUS
Let us have no riddles, Momus ; speak in plain and
explicit language, and supply the name, too. Asit is,
you have flung your statement into the midst of us

all, so that many are making guesses and applying
your remarks now to one and now to another. Being
an exponent of frankness, you must not stick at saying
anything.
, MOMUS
It is splendid, Zeus, that you actually urge me to
frankness; that is a truly royal, high-souled action.
Therefore I shall give the name. It is this peerless
Dionysus, who is half human; in fact, on his mother’s
side he is not even Greek, but the grandson of a
Syrophoenician trader named Cadmus. Inasmuch
as he has been honoured with immortality, I say
nothing of the man himself—either of his hood or of
his drunkenness or of his gait; for you all, I think,
see that he is womanish and unmanly in his character,
half crazy, with strong drink on his breath from the
beginning of the day. But he has foisted upon us a
whole clan; he presents himself at the head of his
rout, and has made gods out of Pan and Silenus and
the Satyrs, regular farm-hands and goat-herds,
most of them—capering fellows with queer shapes.
One of them has horns and looks like a goat from the
waist down, and wears a long beard, so that he is
not much different from a goat. Another is a bald-
pated gaffer with a flat nose who usually rides on a
donkey. He is a Lydian. The Satyrs are prick-
eared, and they too are bald, with horns like those
that bud on new-born kids; they are Phrygians, and
they all have tails. D’ye see what sort of gods he is
making for us, the bounder?

ZEUS
Say nothing, Momus, about either Asclepius or
Heracles, for I see where you are heading in your
speech. As far as they are concerned, one of them
is a doctor who cures people of their illnesses and is
“as good as a host in himself,” ? whilst Heracles,
though my own son, purchased his immortality at
the cost of many labours; so do not denounce them.
MOMUS
I shall hold my tongue, Zeus, for your sake, although
I have plenty to say. Indeed, if there were nothing

that accounts for his failure to mention Icarius’ introduction
into the heavens as Bootes.

more than one place. His critics in Lucian several times
refer to this fact (Timon, 4; Zeus Rants, 45). Lucian very

ZEUS
I assure you, about me it is quite permissible.
But you are not prosecuting me as an alien, are you?
MOMUS
Well, in Crete not only that may be heard, but
they tell another story about you and show people
atomb. However, I put no faith either in them or
in the Achaeans of Aegium, who assert that you are a
changeling.1 But I do intend to speak of one thing
that in my opinion ought by all means to be censured.
It was you, Zeus, who began these illegalities and
caused the corruption of our body politic by cohabit-
ing with mortal women and going down to visit them,
now in one form, now in another. It has gone so far
that we are afraid that someone may make a victim
of you if he catches you when you are a bull, or that
some goldsmith may work you up when you are gold,
and instead of Zeus we may have you turning up as a
necklace or a bracelet or an earring. However that
may be, you have filled heaven with these—demi-
gods! I do not care to put it otherwise. And it is a
very ridiculous state of things when one suddenly
hears that Heracles has been appointed a god, but
Eurystheus, who used to order him about, is dead;
and that the temple of Heracles, who was a slave,
and the tomb of Eurystheus, his master, stand side
by side; and again, that in Thebes Dionysus is a
likely means the place that was pointed out to R. Pashley in
1834 as the tomb of Zeus, on Mt. Juktas; see A. J. Cook’s
Zeus, I, 157-163. The Achaean version of the birth of Zeus
which made him out a changeling is not mentioned elsewhere,
but plenty of places gave him other fathers than Cronus, which
amounts to the same thing.

1 All three were own cousins of Dionysus, being sons of
other daughters of Cadmus; Pentheus of Agave, Actaeon of
Autonoe, and Learchus of Ino. Learchus was killed by his
father Athamas.
2 In Icaromenippus, 27 (II, 312) a similar list of ‘‘ alien
gods of doubtful status’’ is given, in which, besides Pan,
Attis, and Sabazius, we find the Corybantes. For Lucian’s
conception of them, see the note on The Dance, 8 (p. 220, n. 2).
Here only one Corybas is remarked in the sacred precincts.

god, but his cousins Pentheus, Actaeon, and Learchus
were of all mankind the most ill-fated.1
From the moment that you, Zeus, once opened our
doors to such as they and turned your attention to
mortal women, everyone else has copied you, and
not the male sex alone but—what is most unseemly—-
even the goddesses. Who does not know about
Anchises, Tithonus, Endymion, Iasion, and the rest of
them? So I think I shall omit those incidents, for
it would take too long if I were to pass censure on
them.
ZEUS
Say nothing about Ganymede, Momus, for I
shall be angry if you vex the little lad by disparaging
his birth.
MOMUS
Then am I not to speak of the eagle, either, and
say that he too is in heaven, where he sits upon your
royal sceptre and all but nests on your head, passing
for a god? Or must I omit him also, for the sake of
Ganymede?
But Attis at all events, Zeus, and Corybas? and
Sabazius ’—how did they get trundled in upon us?
Does Lucian think of him as that one who was slain by the
others (Clem. Alex., Protr., II, 19), and so as the central figure
of the cult ?
3 Sabazius was the centre of a wide-spread and important
mystery-religion, which merged with that of Dionysus
(Zagreus). He is frequently represented sitting in the palm
of a great hand opened in a gesture like that of benediction
(thumb and first two dingo extended), see Cook’s Zeus, I,
390, Fig. 296. Multitudes of attributes always surround
him, and the bull, the ram, and the snake figured in his cult.
On initiation, a snake was through the clothing of the
initiate, and “‘ snake through the bosom ”’ is said to have been
the pass-word (Clem. Alex., Protr., III, 15, 1).

1 Lucian recognises that the Getae were not Scythians but
Thracians in Icaromenippus, 16, and that Zamolxis belongs
to the Thracians in True Story, II, 17, and Zeus Rants, 44.
On the other hand, the god is styled Scythian in The Scythian,
1 and 4, and in the passage before us, though he is ascribed to

<note type="head">THE PARLIAMENT OF THE GODS</head>
Or Mithras yonder, the Mede, with his caftan and
his cap, who does not even speak Greek, so that he
cannot even understand if one drinks his health?
The result is that the Scythians—the Getae among
them—seeing all this have told us to go hang, and
now confer immortality on their own account and
elect as gods whomsoever they will, in the selfsame
way that Zamolxis, a slave, obtained fraudulent
admission to the roster, getting by with it somehow
or other.
All that, however, is as nothing, Gods.—You
there, you dog-faced, linen-vested Egyptian, who
are you, my fine fellow, and how do you make out
that you are a god, with that bark of yours?? And
with what idea does this spotted bull of Memphis?
receive homage and give oracles and have prophets?
I take shame to mention ibises and monkeys and
billy-goats and other creatures far more ludicrous
that somehow or other have been smuggled out of
Egypt into heaven. How can you endure it, Gods,
to see them worshipped as much as you, or even
more? And you, Zeus, how can you put up with
it when they grow ram’s horns upon you? 4
the Getae, they are represented as Scythian. Perhaps these
two pieces are earlier than the others, and earlier than Tozaris,
where Zamolxis is not mentioned. Zamolxis obtained his
‘fraudulent registration’’ by hiding in a cave and not appear-
ing for four years, according to Herodotus (IV, 95). Strabo
(VII, 5), who says that he was counsellor to the king, who
connived at the fraud, adds that he was followed by a con-
tinuous succession of such gods; and to these Lucian must
be alluding when he speaks of their electing gods.

ZEUS
All these points that you mention about the Egypt-
ians are in truth unseemly. Nevertheless, Momus,
most of them are matters of symbolism and one who
is not an adept in the mysteries really must not
laugh at them.
MOMUS
A lot we need mysteries, Zeus, to know that gods
are gods, and dogheads are dogheads!
ZEUS
Never mind, I say, about the Egyptians. Some
other time we shall discuss their case at leisure.
Go on and name the others.
MOMUS
Trophonius, Zeus, and (what sticks in my gorge
beyond everything) Amphilochus, who, though the
son of an outcast and matricide,! gives prophecies,
the miscreant, in Cilicia, telling lies most of the time
and playing charlatan for the sake of his two obols.
That is why you, Apollo, are no longer in favour;
at present, oracles are delivered by every stone and
every altar that is drenched with oil and has garlands
and can provide itself with a charlatan—of whom
there are plenty. Already the statue of Polydamas
the athlete heals those who have fevers in Olympia,
1 Alomaeon, son of Amphiaraus; he slew his mother
Eriphyle, fled from Argos in frenzy, and never returned.

1 Polydamas, a gigantic pancratiast, was said to have killed
lions with his bare hands and stopped chariots at full speed
by laying hold of them. Pausanias (VI, 5, 1) mentions his
statue at Olympia, made by Lysippus, but does not speak
of its healing the sick. But about the Thasian statue of
Theagenes, who won 1400 crowns as boxer, cratiast,
and runner, and was reputed to be a son of Heracles, we hear
not only from Pausanias (VI, 11, 6-9) but from Oenomaus (in
Euseb., Praep. Evang., V, 34, 6-9) and Dio Chrysostom in
his Rhodiaeus (XXXI, 95-97). After his death, when an
enemy whipped the statue at night, it fell on him and killed
him; so it was tried for murder, and flung into the sea. Har-
434
<pb n="435"/>
<note type="head">THE PARLIAMENT OF THE GODS</head>
and the statue of Theagenes does likewise in Thasos ;1
they sacrifice to Hector in Troy and to Protesilaus
on the opposite shore, in the Chersonese. So, ever
since we became so numerous, perjury and sacrilege
have been increasing, and in general they have
despised us—quite rightly.
Let this suffice on the subject of those who are
base-born and fraudulently registered. But there
are many outlandish names that have come to my
ears, of beings not to be found among us and
unable to exist at all as realities; and over these
too, Zeus, I make very merry. Where is that famous
Virtue, and Nature, and Destiny, and Chance? They
are unsubstantial, empty appellations, excogitated by
those dolts, the philosophers. All the same, arti-
ficial as they are, they have so imposed upon the
witless that nobody is willing to do as much as
sacrifice to us, knowing that though he offer ten
thousand hecatombs, nevertheless “Chance” will
effect what is ‘“‘ fated” and what has been “ spun ”’
for every man from the beginning. So I should like
vests then failed, and after the reason had been elicited from
Delphi, the statue, miraculously recovered by fishermen in
their net, was set up where it had stood before, and sacrifices
were thereafter offered before it ‘‘as to a god.’’ Pausanias
adds that he knows that Theagenes had many other statues
both in Greece and in ‘‘ barbarian ’’ parts, and that he healed
sicknesses and received honours from the natives of those
places. A very similar tale about the statue of another
Olympic victor, the Locrian Euthycles, previously known only
from Oenomaus (ibid., 10-11), can now be traced to the Iambi
of Callimachus (Diegeseis, ed. Vitelli-Norsa, i, 37-ii, 8).
And in Lucian’s Lover of Lies, 18-20 (III, 346, ff.) there is an
amusing account of activities imputed to the statue of Pellichus,
a Corinthian general.

1 Obtaining from fourth-century Athens a formula for
decrees of the senate and people, Olympus has filled in the
blanks as best it could. At Athens, the name of a ph le, or
tribe, would go in the first blank of the preamble, as ‘‘ exer-
cising the prytany’’; but Ob ympus has no tribes, and anyhow
Zeus should come first. So his name is set down there. The
next two offices might now be crossed off; for as Zeus presides

to ask you, Zeus, if you have anywhere seen either
Virtue or Nature or Destiny. I know that you too
are always hearing of them in the discussions of the
philosophers, unless you are deaf, so as not to be able
to hear them screaming.
I still have plenty to say, but I will bring my speech
to an end, for I notice that many are annoyed with
me for my remarks, and are hissing, particularly
those who have been touched to the quick by my
frankness. To conclude, then, with your consent,
Zeus, I shall read a motion on this subject which
has already been committed to writing.
ZEUS
Read it, for not all your criticisms were unreason-
able, and we must put a stop to most of this, so that
it may not increase.
Momus (reads)
“With the blessing of Heaven! In a regular
session of the assembly, held on the seventh of the
month, Zeus presiding, Poseidon first vice-president,
Apollo second vice-president, Momus, son of Night,
recorder, the following resolution was proposed by
Sleep :1
at assemblies, there is no function left for the proedros, or
chairman of the board of presidents, and the office of epistatés,
or chairman of the prytanies, is already filled, since Zeus can
hardly be ‘‘ exercising the prytany”’ in any other capacity.
However, there are the blanks !—and Poseidon, second in the
Olympian hierarchy, will do all the better for proedros if it is
a sinecure, while the duties actually performed by Apollo
as Zeus’ right-hand man and more or less of a factotum,
are not too dissimilar to those of an Athenian epistatés in the
fourth century B.o. These problems solved, the remaining
blanks were easy to fill.

sick or Asclepius give oracles or Apollo combine in
himself so many activities; he shall select one and
be either seer or singer or physician; that the
philosophers be warned not to make up empty names
or talk nonsense about matters of which they know
nothing; that in the case of those who already have
been vouchsafed temples or sacrifices, their images be
pulled down and those of Zeus or Hera or Apollo or
one of the others be substituted; but the city shall
raise a funeral-mound for them and set a gravestone
upon it instead of an altar; that if anyone shall fail
to comply with this proclamation and shall be un-
willing to appear before the deputies, judgement by
default shall be rendered against him.”
There you have the resolution.
ZEUS
It is most equitable, Momus ; so let everyone who is
in favour of the resolution hold up his hand—but
no! I declare it carried, as those who will not vote
for it will be the majority, I know. Well, you may
go now; but when Hermes makes the proclamation,
present yourselves, and let each of you bring un-
mistakable means of identification and clear proofs—
his father’s name and his mother’s, why and how he
became a god, and his tribe and clan. For if anyone
shall fail to put all this in evidence, it will make no
difference to the deputies that he has a huge temple
on earth and that men believe him to be a god.

<head>THE TYRANNICIDE<note><p>This piece and the next are typical productions of the
rhetorical school, where fictitious cases, often highly imagina-
tive and improbable, were debated. The themes were common
property, transmitted from one rhetorician to another. The
one that underlies this declamation, outlined in the argument
which precedes it, was later employed by Libanius (Or. VII)
and still later by Choricius (XXV1). Erasmus, who was the
author of the Latin translation of Tyrannicide and Disowned
in its original form, wrote in Latin a companion-piece to
Tyrannicide, a mock pleading in opposition to it, which is to
be found in several of the old editions of Lucian.
If Lucian abandoned rhetoric at forty, as he says in the
Double Indictment (32: III, 142), both these declamations
should be early works. Of the two, T'yrannicide seems the
earlier, as Disowned more closely approximates the style of his
maturity.</p></note></head>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="1"><p>

A man went to the Acropolis to slay the tyrant. He did
not find him, but slew his son and left his sword in the body.
When the tyrant came and saw his son already dead, he
slew himself with the same sword. The man who went up
and slew the tyrant’s son claims the reward for slaying the
tyrant.
Two tyrants, gentlemen of the jury,! have been
done to death by me in a single day, one already
past his prime, the other in the ripeness of his years
and in better case to take up wrongdoing in his turn.
Yet I have come to claim but one reward for both,
as the only tyrant-slayer of all time who has done
away with two malefactors at a single blow, killing
the son with the sword and the father by means of
‘his affection for his son. The tyrant has paid us a
sufficient penalty for what he did, for while he still
lived he saw his son, prematurely slain, in the toils
of death, and at last (a thing incomparably strange)
he himself was constrained to become his own exe-
cutioner. And his son not only met death at my
hands, but even after death assisted me to slay
another ; for though while he still lived he shared his
father’s crimes, after his death he slew his father as
best he might.
1 The form of procedure posited is analogous to dokimasia
at Athens. The claimant’s right to the reward offered by the
state has been challenged by one of his fellow-citizens, and
the authorities have referred the question to a jury. The
adversary, as plaintiff, has already spoken.

It was I, then, who put an end to the tyranny, and
the sword that accomplished everything was mine.
But I inverted the order of executions, and made an
innovation in the method of putting criminals to
death, for I myself destroyed the stronger, the one
capable of self-defence, and resigned the old man to
my unaided sword. *
It was my thought, therefore, that I should get for
this a still more generous gift from you, and should
receive rewards to match the number of the slain,
because I had freed you not only from your present
ills, but from your expectation of those that were to
come, and had accorded you established liberty,
since no successor in wrongdoing had been left alive.
But now there is danger that after all these achieve-
ments I may come away from you unrewarded and
may be the only one to be excluded from the re-
compense afforded by those laws which I maintained.
My adversary here seems to me to be taking this
course, not, as he says, because of his concern for the
interests of the state, but because of his grief over
the dead men, and in the endeavour to avenge them
upon the man who caused their death. On your
part, however, gentlemen of the jury, bear with me
for a moment while I recount the history of their
tyranny, although you know it well; for then you
can appreciate the greatness of my benefaction and
you yourselves will be more exultant, thinking of
all that you have escaped.
It is not as it has often before been with others ;
it is not a simple tyranny and a single slavery that we
have endured, nor a single master’s caprice that we
have borne. Nay, of all those who have ever ex-
perienced such adversity we alone had two masters

instead of one and were torn asunder, unlucky folk!
between two sets of wrongs. The elder man was
more moderate by far, less acrimonious in his fits of
anger, less hasty in his punishments, and less
headlong in his desires, because by now his age was
staying the excessive violence of his impulses and
curbing his appetite for pleasures. It was said,
indeed, that he was reluctantly impelled to begin
his wrongdoings by his son, since he himself was not
at all tyrannical but yielded to the other. For he was
excessively devoted to his children, as he has shown,
and his son was all the world to him; so he gave way
to him, did the wrongs that he bade, punished the
men whom he designated, served him in all things,
and in a word was tyrannised by him, and was mere
minister to his son’s desires.
The young man conceded the honour to him by
right of age and abstained from the name of sove-
reignty, but only from that; he was the substance
and the mainspring of the tyranny. He gave the
government its assurance and security, and he alone
reaped the profit of its crimes. It was he who kept
their guardsmen together, who maintained their
defences in strength, who terrorised their subjects and
extirpated conspirators; it was he who plucked lads
from their homes, who made a mockery of marriages;
it was for him that maids were carried off; and what-
ever deeds of blood there were, whatever banish-
ments, confiscations of property, applications of
torture, and outrages—all these were a young man’s
emprises. The old man followed him and shared his

wrongdoing, and had but praise for his son’s misdeeds.
So the thing became unendurable to us; for when the
desires of the will acquire the licence of sovereignty,
they recognise no limit to wrongdoing.
What hurt us most was to know that our slavery
would be long, nay unending, that our city would be
handed down by succession from despot to despot,
and that our folk would be the heritage of villains.
To other peoples it is no slight comfort to think, and
to tell one another, ‘“‘ But it will stop soon,” ‘‘ But
he will die soon, and in a little while we shall be
free.’ In their case, however, there was no such
comfort; we saw the successor to the sovereignty
already at hand. Therefore not one of the brave
men who entertained the same purpose as myself
even ventured to make an attempt. Liberty was
wholly despaired of, and the tyranny was thought
invincible, because any attempt would be directed
against so many.
This, however, did not frighten me; I did not
draw back when I estimated the difficulty of the
achievement, nor play the coward in the face of
danger. Alone, alone, I climbed the hill to front the
tyranny that was so strong and many-headed—yet,
not alone but with my sword that shared the fray
with me and in its turn was tyrant-slayer too. I had
my death in prospect, but sought to purchase our
common liberty with the shedding of my own blood.
I met the first guard-post, routed the guardsmen with
no little difficulty, slew whomsoever I encountered,
destroyed whatsoever blocked my path. Then I
assailed the very forefront of my tasks, the sole

strength of the tyranny, the cause of our calamities.
I came upon the warden of the citadel, I saw him
offer a brave defence and hold out against many
wounds; and yet I slew him.
The tyranny, therefore, had at last been over-
thrown, my undertaking had attained fulfilment,
and from that moment we all were free. Only an
old man still remained, unarmed, his guards lost,
that mighty henchman of his gone, deserted, no
longer even worthy of a valiant arm.
Thereupon, gentlemen of the jury, I thus reasoned
with myself; “ All has gone well for me, everything
is accomplished, my success is complete. How shall
the survivor be punished? Of me and my right
hand he is unworthy, particularly if his slaying were
to follow a glorious, daring, valiant deed, dishonour-
ing that other mortal thrust. He must seek a fitting
executioner, a change of fate, and not profit by
having the same one. Let him behold, suffer his
punishment, have the sword lying at hand; I commit
the rest to him.” This plan formed, I myself with-
drew, and he, as I had presaged, carried through
with it, slew the tyrant, supplied the ending to my
lay.
P Tam here, then, to bring you democracy, to notify
all that they may now take heart, and to herald the
glad tidings of liberty. Even now you are enjoying
the results of my achievements. The acropolis, as
you see, is empty of malefactors, and nobody issues
by writing a over vy; in consequence of which those two
letters were mistakenly admitted into the text, as often
happens in the Lucianic tradition. .

orders; you may bestow honours, sit in judgement,
and plead your cases in accordance with the laws.
All this has come about for you through me and my
bold deed, and in consequence of slaying that one
man, after which his father could no longer continue
in life. Therefore I request that you give me the
reward which is my due, not because I am greedy or
avaricious, or because it was my purpose to benefit
my native land for hire, but because I wish that my
achievements should be confirmed by the donative
and that my undertaking should escape misre-
presentation and loss of glory on the ground that it
was not fully executed and has been pronounced
unworthy of a reward.
This man, however, opposes my plea, and says
that I am acting unreasonably in desiring to be
honoured and to receive the gift, since I am not a
tyrant-slayer, and have not accomplished anything in
the eyes of the law; that my achievement is in some
respect insufficient for claiming the reward. I ask
him, therefore: ‘“‘ What more do you demand of me?
Did I not form the purpose? Did I not climb the hill?
DidI not slay? Did I not bring liberty? Does any-
one issue orders? Does anyone give commands?
Does any lord and master utter threats? Did any of
the malefactors escape me? Youcannot say so. No,
everything is full of peace, we have all our laws,
liberty is manifest, democracy is made safe, marriages
are free from outrage, boys are free from fear,
maidens are secure, and the city is celebrating its
common good fortune. Who, then, is responsible for
it all? Who stopped all that and caused all this?
If there is anyone who deserves to be honoured in
preference to me, I yield the guerdon, I resign the

gift. But if I alone accomplished it all, making the
venture, incurring the risks, going up to the citadel,
taking life, inflicting punishment, wreaking vengeance
upon them through one another, why do you mis-
represent my achievements? Why, pray, do you
make the people ungrateful towards me? ”
“Because you did not slay the tyrant himself;
and the law bestows the reward upon the slayer of a
tyrant!” Is there any difference, tell me, between
slaying him and causing his death? For my part I
think there is none. All that the lawgiver had
in view was simply liberty, democracy, freedom from
dire ills. He bestowed honour upon this, he con-
sidered this worthy of compensation; and you
cannot say that it has come about otherwise than
through me. For if I caused a death which made it
impossible for that man to live, I myself accom-
plished his slaying. The deed was mine, the hand was
his. Then quibble no longer about the manner of
his end; do not enquire how he died, but whether
he no longer lives, whether his no longer living is
due to me. Otherwise, it seems to me that you
will be likely to carry your enquiry still further, to
the point of carping at your benefactors if one of
them should do the killing with a stone or a staff or
in some other way, and not with a sword.
What if I had starved the tyrant out of his hold and
thus occasioned the necessity of his death? Would
you in that case require me to have killed him with
my own hand, or say that I failed in any respect of
satisfying the law, even though the malefactor had
been done to death more cruelly? Enquire into one
thing only, demand this alone, disturb yourself about
this alone, whether any one of the villains is left, any

expectation of fearfulness, any reminder of our woes.
If everything is uncontaminated and peaceful, only
a cheat would wish to utilise the manner of ac-
complishing what has been done in order to take
away the gratuity for the hard-won results.
I remember, moreover, this statement in the laws
(unless, by reason of our protracted slavery, I have
forgotten what is said in them), that there are two
sorts of responsibility for manslaughter, and if,
without taking life himself or doing the deed with
his own hand, a man has necessitated and given rise
to the killing, the law requires that in this case
too he himself receive the same punishment—quite
justly, for it was unwilling to be worsted by his
deed through his immunity. It would be irrele-
vant, therefore, to enquire into the manner of the
killing.
Can it, then, be that you think fit to punish as a
murderer one who has taken life in this manner, and
are not willing under any circumstances to acquit
him, yet when a man has conferred a boon upon the
city in the same way, you do not propose to hold him
worthy of the same treatment as your benefactors?
For you cannot even say that I did it at haphazard,
and that a result followed which chanced to be bene-
ficial, without my having intended it. What else did
I fear after the stronger was slain, and why did I
leave the sword in my victim if I did not absolutely
prefigure exactly what would come to pass! You
have no answer, unless you maintain that the dead
man was not a tyrant and did not have that

name; and that the city would not have been glad
to make many presents on his account if he should
lose his life. But you cannot say so.
Can it be that, now the tyrant has been slain,
you are going to refuse the reward to the man who
caused his death? What pettiness! Does it con-
cern you how he died, as long as you enjoy your
liberty? Do you demand any greater boon of the
man who gave back your democracy? ‘“‘ But the
law,” you say, ‘“‘scrutinises only the main point
in the facts of the case, ignoring all the incidentals
and raising no further question!’’ What! was
there not once a man who obtained the guerdon of
a tyrannicide by just driving a tyrant into exile?
Quite rightly, too; for he bestowed liberty in
exchange for slavery. But what I have wrought
is not exile, or expectation of a second uprising,
but complete abolition, extinction of the entire
line, extirpation, root and branch, of the whole
menace.
Do, in the name of the gods, make a full enquiry,
if you like, from beginning to end, and see whether
anything that affects the law has been left undone,
and whether any qualification is wanting that a
tyrant-slayer ought to have. In the first place, one
must have at the outset a will that is valiant, patriotic,
disposed to run risks for the common weal, and ready
to purchase by its own extinction the deliverance of
the people. Then did I fall short of that, play the
weakling, or, my purpose formed, shrink from any
of the risks that lay ahead? You cannot say so.
Then confine your attention for a moment to this
1 The allusion is to Harmodius, who slew Hipparchus,
the brother of the tyrant Hippias.

point, and imagine that simply on account of my
willing and planning all this, even if the result had
not been favourable, I presented myself and de-
manded that in consequence of the intention itself
I should receive a guerdon as a benefactor. Be-
cause I myself had not the power and someone
else, coming after me, had slain the tyrant, would
it be unreasonable, tell me, or absurd to give it
me? Above all, if I said: ‘“‘ Gentlemen, I wanted
it, willed it, undertook it, essayed it; simply for my
intention I deserve to be honoured,” what answer
would you have made in that case?
But as things are, that is not what I say; no, I
climbed the acropolis, I put myself in peril, I ac-
complished untold labours before I slew the young
man. For you must not suppose that the affair was
so easy and simple—to pass a guard, to overpower
men-at-arms, to rout so many by myself; no, this
is quite the mightiest obstacle in the slaying of a
tyrant, and the principal of its achievements. For of
course it is not the tyrant himself that is mighty and
impregnable and indomitable, but what guards and
maintains his tyranny; if anyone conquers all this,
he has attained complete success, and what remains
is trivial. Of course the approach to the tyrants
would not have been open to me if I had not over-
powered all the guards and henchmen about them,
conquering all these to begin with. I add nothing
further, but once more confine myself to this point:
I overpowered the outposts, conquered the body-
guards, rendered the tyrant unprotected, unarmed,
defenceless. Does it seem to you that I deserve
honour for that, or do you further demand of me the
shedding of his blood?

But even if you require bloodshed, that is not
wanting either, and I am not unstained with blood;
on the contrary, I have done a great and valiant
deed in that I slew a young man in the fullness of
his strength, terrible to all, through whom that
other was unassailed by plots, on whom alone he
relied, who sufficed him instead of many guardsmen.
Then am I not deserving of a reward, man? Am I
to be devoid of honours for such deeds? What if I
had killed a bodyguard, or some henchman of the
tyrant, or a valued slave? Would not even this
have seemed a great thing, to go up and slay one of
the tyrant’s friends in the midst of the citadel, in
the midst of arms? But as it is, look at the slain
man himself! He was a tyrant’s son, nay more, a
harsher tyrant, an inexorable despot, a more cruel
chastiser, a more violent oppressor; what is most
important, he was heir and successor to everything,
and capable of prolonging vastly the duration of our
misery.
Suppose, if you will, that this was my sole achieve-
ment—that the tyrant has made his escape and is
still alive. Well and good, I demand a guerdon for
this. What do you all say? Will you not vouch-
safe it? Did you not view the son, too, with
concern? Was he notadespot? Was he not cruel,
unendurable?
As it is, however, think of the crowning feat itself.
What this man requires of me I accomplished in the
best possible way. I killed the tyrant by killing
someone else, not directly nor at a single blow, which
would have been his fondest prayer after misdeeds
so monstrous. No, first I tortured him with profound
grief, displayed full in his view. all that was dearest

to him lying exposed in pitiable case, a son in his
youth, wicked, to be sure, but in the fullness of his
strength and the image of his sire, befouled with
blocd and gore. Those are the wounds of fathers,
those the swords of tyrannicides who deal justly,
that is the death deserved by savage tyrants, that
the requital befitting misdeeds so great. To die
forthwith, to know nothing, to see no such spectacle
has in it nothing worthy of a tyrant’s punishment.
For I was not unaware, man—I was not un-
aware, nor was anyone else, how much love he had for
his son, and that he would not have wanted to outlive
him even a little while. To be sure, all fathers no
doubt have such feelings toward their children;
‘but in his case there was something more than in the
case of others; naturally, for he discerned that it
was his son who alone cherished and guarded the
tyranny, who alone faced danger in his father’s
stead, and gave security to his rule. Consequently
I knew that he would lay down his life at once, if
not through his love, then at all events through his
despair, considering that there was no profit in life
now that the security derived from his son had been
abolished. I encompassed him, therefore, with all
manner of toils at once—his nature, his grief, his
despair, his misgivings about the future; I used
these allies against him, and forced him to that final
decision. He has gone to his death childless, grief-
stricken, in sorrow and in tears, after mourning but
a little while, it is true, yet long enough for a
father; gone (and that is most horrible) by his own

hand, the most pitiable of deaths, far more bitter
than as if it should come about at the hand of
another.
Where is my sword? Does anyone else recognise
this? Was this any other man’s weapon? Who
carried it up to the citadel? Who preceded the
tyrant in its use? Who commissioned it against
him? Good sword, partner and promoter of my
successes, after so many perils, after so many slayings,
we are disregarded and thought unworthy of a re-
ward! If it were for the sword alone that I sought
the meed of honour trom you—if I were pleading:
“Gentlemen, when the tyrant wished to die and
at the moment found himself unarmed, this sword of
mine served him and did its part in every way
towards the attainment of liberty—account it worthy
of honour and reward,” would you not have requited
the owner of a possession so valuable to the state?
Would you not have recorded him among your bene-
factors? Would you not have enshrined the sword
among your hallowed treasures? Would you not
have worshipped it along with the gods?
Now then, imagine, I beg you, what the tyrant
no doubt did and what he said before his end. When
I sought to slay the son and wounded him again
and again in those parts of his body which could be
seen, that so I might grieve the parent most, that
so I might rend his heart through the first sight, he
raised a doleful cry, calling his parent to him, not to
aid him or share the conflict—for he knew him to
be old and weak—but to behold his own calamities.

whole plot of the tragedy, but had left to the actor the
body, the stage-setting, the sword, and the remainder
of the play. When the other made his appearance
and saw his only son with but little breath in him,
bloodied, covered with gore, his wounds close
together, numerous, and vital, he raised this cry:
“ My child, we are destroyed, assassinated, fallen
victims to the tyrant-slayer! Where is the exe-
cutioner? For what purpose is he keeping me, for
what purpose reserving me, now that I am already
destroyed through you, my child? Or is it perhaps
that he contemns me as an old man, and also by his
dilatoriness (since I must be punished) protracts my
death and makes my execution longer? ”
With these words he sought a sword; for he was
unarmed on account of his complete reliance upon
his son. But that too was not wanting; long
beforehand, that too had been provided by me and
left behind for the bold deed that was to come.
So, withdrawing the sword from the victim, plucking
it from the wound, he said: ‘‘ A little while ago you
gave me death; now give me repose, Osword. Come
to console a mourning father; lighten the task of an
aged hand beset by adversity; let my blood; be
tyrant-slayer to me; quit me of my woe. Had I
but encountered you first! had I but inverted the
order of deaths! I should have perished; but
simply as tyrant—but thinking still that I should
have an avenger, while now I die as one who is
childless, as one who can hardly so much as find a
man to take his life! ’’ Thereupon he hastened his
despatch, trembling, incapable, craving it, to be
sure, but lacking the strength to serve his bold
purpose.

How many punishments were there in all this?
How many wounds? How many deaths? How
many tyrant-slayings? How many rewards? And
at the end you have all seen not only the young
man exposed in death (no slight accomplishment or
easy to achieve), but the old man prostrate upon
him, you have seen the blood of both intermingled
(that thank-offering for liberty and for victory),
and the havoc of my sword; aye, the sword itself
between them both, evincing that it has not been
unworthy of its owner and testifying that it served me
faithfully. Had this been done by me, it would be
less of an achievement ; but now it is more splendid
by reason of its novelty. It is I, to be sure, who
overthrew the entire tyranny; but the performance
has been distributed among many people as in a
play; the leading part was played by me, the second
by the son, the third by the tyrant himself, and the
sword served all.

<head>DISOWNED<note><p>The fictitious case which underlies this declamation is
outlined in the argument that precedes the text. An earlier
treatment of the same theme is to be found in the Controversiae
of Seneca Rhetor (IV, 5). In the Lucianic piece, the speaker’s
references to his stepmother constitute a notable example of
sustained irony as a rhetorical device.</p></note></head>

A son who had been disowned studied medicine. When his
father became insane and had been given up by the other
doctors, he cured him by administering a remedy, and was again
received into the family. After that, he was ordered to
cure his stepmother, who was insane, and as he refused to do so,
he is now being disowned again.
There is nothing novel or surprising, gentlemen of
the jury, in my father’s present course, and this is
not the first time that he has displayed such anger ;
on the contrary, he keeps this law always in readiness
and resorts to this court by habit.2, There is, however,
something of novelty in my present plight, in that I
am under no personal charge, but am in jeopardy of
punishment on behalf of my profession because it
cannot in every particular obey his behests. But what
could be more absurd than to give treatment under
orders, in accordance, not with the powers of the pro-
fession, but with the desires of my father? I could
wish, to be sure, that medical science had a remedy
certain case of disownment at Athens is known; but Dionysius
of Halicarnassus (Arch., II, 26) says that provisions for it
were included in the codes of Solon, Pittacus, and Charondas,
there is one in Plato’s Laws (XI, 928D; it involves a family
council), and Egyptian documents attest it. P. M. Meyer,
in publishing one of them (Juristische Papyri, No. XI) cites
Cod. Just., VIII, 46, 6: abdicatio, quae Graeco more ad
alienandos liberos usurpatur et apoceryxis dicebatur, Romanis
legibus non comprobatur.

of such sort that it could check not only insanity
but unjust anger, in order that I might cure my
father of this disorder also. As things are, his
madness has been completely assuaged, but his
anger is growing worse, and (what is hardest of all)
he is sane to everyone else and insane towards me
alone, his physician. You see, therefore, what fee
I receive for my attendance—I am disowned by him
once more and put away from my family a second
time, as if I had been taken back for a brief space
merely that I might be more disgraced by being
turned out of the household repeatedly.
For my part, in cases which can be cured I do not
wait to be summoned; on the previous occasion, for
instance, I came to his relief uncalled. But when a
case is perfectly desperate, I am unwilling even to
essay it. And in respect to this woman I am with
good reason even less venturesome, since I take into
consideration how I should be treated by my father
if I were to fail, when without having so much as -
begun treating her I am disowned. I am indeed
pained, gentlemen of the jury, at my stepmother’s
serious condition (for she was a good woman), at
my father’s distress on her account, and most of all
at my own apparent disobedience and real inabilit
to do the'service which is enjoined upon me, bot
because of the extraordinary violence of the illness
and the ineffectiveness of the art of healing. I do
not think, however, that it is just to disown a man
who declines at the outset to promise what he
cannot perform.
The charges on which he disowned me before
can be readily understood from the present situation.
To those charges I have made a sufficient answer, I

think, by my subsequent life, and these accusations
which he now brings I shall dispose of to the best of
my ability; but first I shall tell you a little about my
position.
I who am so difficult and disobedient, who so dis-
grace my father and act so unworthily of my family,
on the former occasion thought it behoved me to
make little opposition to him when he was making
all that clamour and straining his lungs. On leaving
the house, I expected to have a grand jury and a
true verdict in my subsequent life, with its disclosure
that I was at a very great remove from those offences
with which I had been charged by my father, that I
had devoted myself to the noblest of pursuits, and
that I was frequenting the best company. I foresaw,
too, something like this, suspecting even then that it
indicated no great sanity in a father to be angry
unjustly and to concoct false accusations against a
son. And there were those who held all that to be
the beginning of madness, the hostile demonstration
and skirmish-fire of the disease that was soon to
fall upon him—the insensate hatred, the cruel law,
the ready abusiveness, the grim tribunal, the clamour,
the anger, and in general the atrabiliousness which
impregnated the whole proceedings. Therefore I
expected that perhaps I should some day need a
knowledge of medicine.
I went abroad, then, studied with the most famous
physicians in foreign parts, and by dint of great
labour and insistent zeal thoroughly mastered the
art. On my return I found my father by then defin-

itively insane and given up by the local physicians, who
had not profound insight and could not accurately dis-
tinguish different forms of disease. Yet I did as was
natural for an uprigne son to do, neither cherishing
a grudge because of my being disowned, nor waiting
to be sent after; for I had no fault to find with him
personally, but all those offences were of extraneous
origin and, as I have said already, peculiar to the
disease. So I came without being called, but did
not begin the treatment at once. It is not our
custom to do so, and the art of medicine does not re-
commend that course; we are taught first of all to
observe whether the disease is curable or irremediable
and beyond the limits of medical skill. Then, if it
is manageable, we put our hands to it and make
every effort to save the patient; but if we see that
the ailment already has the upper hand and is victori-
ous, we do not touch it at all, observing an ancient
law of the progenitors of the art of medicine, who
say that one must not lay hand to those who are
overmastered.!
Since I saw that my father was still within hope
and his ailment not beyond professional skill, after
long observation and accurate investigation of all
details I set my hand to it at last and compounded
my remedy confidently, although many of those
present were suspicious of my prescription, critical of
my treatment of the case, and ready to bring charges
against me. My stepmother was present also,
panic-stricken and distrustful, not because she hated
me but because she was fearful and well aware that
he was in a bad way; she knew it because she alone
associated exclusively with him and lived side by

side with his disorder. Nevertheless, without any
timidity (for I knew that the symptoms would not
cheat me or betray the profession) I applied the
treatment at the nick of time for the attempt,
although some of my friends advised me not to be
overbold for fear that failure bring upon me a more
serious imputation of avenging myself upon my father
with poison, having conceived a grudge against him
for what I had suffered at his hands.
To sum it up, he became well at once, recovered
his sanity, and was thoroughly in command of his
faculties. Those present were amazed, and my
stepmother was full of praise, making it plain to all
that she was delighted with my success and his
sanity. And as for my father here (for I am able to
testify on his behalf) without delay and without
asking any advice in this matter, as soon as he had
heard the whole story from those who were there, he
annulled the disownment and made me his son once
more, calling me his saviour and benefactor, admitting
that he had tested me thoroughly, and defending
himself for his former charges. This event gave joy
to many, the men of rectitude who were there, and
pain to those who preferred the disownment of a
son to his resumption. I saw, anyhow, at the time
that not all were equally pleased with the affair, but
at once one or another showed changed colour, dis-
turbed eyes, and an angry face, such as comes from
jealousy and hatred.
Well, we were rejoicing and making merry, as
was natural, since we had regained each other, when
after a short time my stepmother suddenly began
to be afflicted, gentlemen of the jury, with an ailment
which was severe and unusual. I observed the

affliction constantly from the moment when it began,
Her form of insanity was not simple or superficial ;
some trouble of long ago, lurking in the soul, had
broken out and won its way into the open. We have,
of course, many symptoms of incurable madness,
but in the case of this woman I have observed one
that is novel; towards everyone else she is very
civil and gentle, and in their presence the disease is
peaceful, but if she sees any physician and simply
hears that he is one, she is beyond all things exas-
perated against him, and this in itself is proof that
her condition is bad and incurable.
Seeing this, I was distressed and pitied the woman,
who was worthy of it and unfortunate beyond her
deserts. My father, in his inexperience (for he
does not know either the origin of the trouble that
holds her in its grip, or its cause, or the extent of the
infirmity), bade me treat her and give her the same
medicine; for he thinks that madness has but one
form, that the ailment is simple, and that her illness
is identical with his, permitting the same treatment.
When I say what is as true as true can be, that it is
impossible to save his wife and confess that I am
worsted by the disorder, he is indignant and angry,
and says that I am deliberately shirking and giving
the woman up, thus making the ineffectiveness of
the art of medicine a reproach against me. He does,
indeed, what is habitually done by people who are
offended; all are angry at those who speak the
truth in frankness. In spite of that, I shall plead to
the best of my ability against him, not only for myself
but for my art.

First, I shall begin with the law under which he
wishes to disown me, in order that he may discover
that his power is now no longer what it was before.
The lawgiver, father,has not permitted all to exercise
the privilege of disownment, or upon all sons, or as
often as they choose, or upon all manner of grounds.
On the contrary, just as he has conceded to fathers
the right to exercise such anger, just so he has made
provision in behalf of sons, that they may not suffer it
unjustly ; and for that reason he has not allowed the
punishment to be inflicted freely or without trial,
but has ordered men to be summoned to court and
empanelled as investigators who will not be influenced
either by anger or by malice in determining what is
just. For he knew that many people on many
occasions are obsessed by senseless reasons for
anger; that one believes a malicious falsehood, while
another relies upon a servant or an unfriendly female.
It was not his idea, therefore, that the thing should
go untried or that sons should at once lose their case
by default. Water is measured,! a hearing is given,
and nothing is left uninvestigated.
Accordingly, since it is within your powers, since
my father controls only the charge, and you who sit
in judgement control the decision whether his accusa-
tion is reasonable, do not yet consider his specific
allegation against me and the ground of his present
indignation, but first examine that other point,
whether he should still be allowed to disown a son
when, after once for all disowning him, using the
privilege that derives from the law and exercising to
the full this paternal suzerainty, he has subsequently

taken him back again and annulled the disownment.
I say that such a thing is most unjust—for punish-
ments, precisely in the case of children, to be inter-
minable, their condemnations numerous, and their
fear eternal; for the law at one moment to share
the prosecutor’s anger, only soon afterward to relax,
and then again to be as severe as before; in a word,
for justice to be altered this way and that to conform
to the momentary opinion of fathers. No, the first
time it is right to give the parent free rein, to share
his anger with him, to make him arbiter of the
punishment; but if, once for all, he expends his
privilege, makes full use of the law, satisfies his anger,
and then afterwards takes back his son, persuaded
that he deserves it, he must abide by it, and not keep
shifting, changing his mind, and altering his decision.
When that son was born there was no way, of
course, to ascertain whether he would turn out to be
bad or good, and on that account the privilege of
repudiating children who are unworthy of their
family has been allowed to their parents, since they
determined to bring them up at a time when they
were unaware ofthis. When, however, under no con-
straint but able to do as he pleases, a man himself,
of his own motion and after putting his son to
the test, takes him back, what pretext for change of
mind remains, or what further recourse to the law?
The legislator would say to you: “ If he was bad and
deserved to be disowned, what made you ask him
back? Why did you readmit him to your house?
Why did you nullify the law? You were free and
at liberty not to do this. Surely it cannot be con-
ceded that you should make sport of the laws and that

the courts should be convened to suit your changes
of mind, that the laws should be relaxed one moment
and enforced the next and the jurors sit to register,
or rather to execute, your decisions, inflicting a
penalty at one time, bringing you together at another,
as often as it shall please you. You begat him
once for all, you brought him up once for all, and
have once for all, in return for this, the power to
disown him, and then only if you are held to be
doing it justly. This persistence, this intermin-
ability, this prodigious casualness is beyond the legal
right of a father.”
In Heaven’s name, gentlemen of the jury, do not
permit him, once he has effected the reinstatement
of his own free will, set aside the decision of the
former court, and nullified his anger, to reinvoke the
same penalty and to recur to the right of a father
when its term by now is over and done with, in-
operative in his case alone because it is already used
up. You perceive, surely, that in all courts where
jurors are drawn by lot, if a man thinks that the
verdict is unjust, the law allows him to appeal from
them to another tribunal; but if people have them-
selves of their own accord agreed upon jurors and
willingly committed the arbitrament to them, that is
not then the case. For there was no need to consult
them at all; but if a man has selected them of his own
choice, he ought to remain content with their decision.
So it is with you: a son who seemed to you unworthy
of his lineage need never have been taken back, but
one whom you have pronounced good and taken

back again you will not thereafter be able to disown ;
for you yourself have borne witness that he does not
deserve to undergo this again, and have acknowledged
that he is good. It is fitting, therefore, that his
reinstatement should be irrevocable and the re-
conciliation binding after deliberation so oft-repeated,
and two sessions of court, one (the first) in which
you repudiated him, the other (your own) when you
changed your mind and undid it. By setting aside
the earlier decision you have guaranteed your later
determination. Abide, then, by your latest purpose
and maintain your own verdict; you must be a
father, for that is what you decided, what you
approved, what you ratified.
Even if I were not your own son, but adopted, and
you wished to disown me, I should not think you
could; for what it was possible not to do at all, it is
unjust to undo once it has taken place. But when
a son has been got by birth, and then again by choice
and decision, how is it reasonable to put him away
again and deprive him repeatedly of that single
relationship? If I happened to be a slave, and at
first, thinking me vicious, you had put me in irons,
but on becoming convinced that I was not a wrong-
doer you had let me go and set me free, would it be
in your power, if you became angry on occasion, to
bring me back into the same condition of slavery? By
no means, for the laws require that such pacts should
be permanent and under all circumstances valid.
Upon the point that it is no longer in his power to
disown one whom he has once disowned and then of
his own accord taken back I still have much to say ;
nevertheless, I shall make an end. But consider
what manner of man he will now be disowning. I do

not mean that then I was but a layman, whereas
now I am a physician, for my profession would avail
me nothing in this respect. Nor that then I was
young, whereas now I am well on in years and
derive from my age the right to have it believed
that I would do no wrong; for that too is perhaps
trivial. But at that time, even if he had suffered
no wrong, as I should maintain, yet he had received
no benefit from me when he excluded me from the
house ; whereas now I have recently been his saviour
and benefactor. What could be more ungrateful
than that, after he had been saved through me and
had escaped so great a danger, he should at once
make return in this way, taking no account of that
cure; nay, should so easily forget and try to drive
into loneliness a man who, when he might justly
have exulted over those who had unjustly cast
him out, not only had borne him no grudge but
actually had saved his life and made him sound of
mind?
It is no trifling or commonplace benefit, gentlemen
of the jury, that I have conferred upon him; and
yet I am accounted worthy of treatment like this.
Although he himself does not know what happened
then, you all know how he acted and felt and what his
condition was when, taking him in hand after the
other doctors had given up, while the members of
the family were avoiding him and not venturing
even to approach him, I made him what you see him,
so that he is able to bring charges and argue about the
laws. Stay! you can see your counterpart, father;
you were nearly as your wife is now, when I brought
you back to your former sanity. Truly it is not just
that I should receive such a recompense for it, or that

you should employ your reason only against me.
That I have done you no little good is clear from the
very charges which you bring; you hate me because
I do not cure your wife when she is at the end of
everything and in an utterly wretched plight. Since
I freed you from a similar condition, why are you
not far rather overjoyed and thankful to have been
liberated from a state so terrible? Instead, and it is
most ungrateful—you no sooner recover your sanity
than you bring me to court and after your life has
been saved, seek to punish me, reverting to that
old-time hatred and citing the self-same law. It is a
handsome fee, in truth, that you pay in this manner
to the art of healing, and a fitting price for your
medicines, to employ your sanity only to attack your
physician !
Will you, gentlemen of the jury, empower this
man to punish his benefactor, to banish his saviour,
to hate the one who made him sane, to take vengeance
on the one who set him on his feet? Not if you do
what is just. For if I were really now guilty of the
greatest offences, there was no slight gratitude
owing me previously; keeping this in sight and in
mind, he would have done well to ignore the present
and to be prompt to forgive for the sake of the past,
especially if the benefaction were so great as to
overtop everything subsequent. That, I think, is
true of mine toward this man, whom I saved, who
is my debtor for the whole of his life, to whom I
have given existence, sanity, and intelligence, and
that at a time when all the others had finally given
up and were confessing themselves defeated by the
malady.
My benefaction, I think, is the greater because,

although I was not his son at that time and had no
imperative reason to take the case but was free
and independent, having been released from the
responsibility imposed by nature, nevertheless I was
not indifferent but came voluntarily, unsummoned,
on my own initiative; I gave my assistance, lavished
my attentions, brought about a cure, and set my
father on his feet, preserving him for myself, pleading
my own cause against his disownment, stilling his
anger by my friendliness, annulling the law by my
love, purchasing by a great benefaction my re-
entrance into the family, demonstrating my loyalty
to my father at a crisis so dangerous, bringing about
my own adoption with the help of my profession, and
proving myself a legitimate son in his time of dire
need.
What do you suppose my sufferings were, what my
exertions, to be with him, to wait upon him, to watch
my opportunity, now yielding to the full force of the
ailment, now bringing my professional skill to bear
when the disorder abated a little? And truly, of all
these duties that are included in medical science,
the most dangerous is to treat such patients and to
approach people in that condition, for often they
loose their frenzy upon those who are near them,
when their ailment has become severe. And yet
none of these considerations made me hesitant or
faint-hearted. I joined battle with the disease and
measured myself against it in every way, and so at
last prevailed by means of my remedy.
Let no one, hearing this, be quick to remark:

body easy to cure, and take thought for the patient’s
whole condition, purging him, reducing him, nourish-
ing him with the proper foods, rousing him as
much as is expedient, planning for periods of sleep,
contriving periods of solitude. Those who have any
other sickness can readily be persuaded to consent to
all this, but the insane because of their independence
of spirit are hard to influence and hard to direct,
dangerous to the physician, and hard to conquer by
the treatment. Often when we think we are near
the goal at last and become hopeful, some trivial
slip, occurring when the illness has reached its
height, easily overturns everything that has been
done, hampers the treatment, and thwarts our skill.
When a man has endured all this, has wrestled with
an illness so serious, and has conquered the ailment
of all ailments most difficult to master, will you
empower the plaintiff to disown him again, permit
him to interpret the laws in any way he will against
a benefactor, and allow him to fight with nature?
I, obeying nature, save and preserve my father for
my own sake, gentlemen of the jury, even if he
wrongs me; but that father, following, he says, the
laws, ruins the son that has done him a benefit, and
deprives him of his family. He is his son’s enemy,
I am my father’s friend. I cherish nature, he slights
and insults her just claims. To think of a father who
hates his son unjustly! To think of a son that loves his
father still more unjustly! For I bring it as a charge

against myself, since my father constrains me to do
so, that I who am hated love when I should not and
love more than I ought. Yet it is nature’s behest
that fathers love their sons more than sons their
fathers. He, however, deliberately slights even the
laws, which preserve for the family sons who have
done no wrong, as well as nature, who draws parents
into great affection for their children. It cannot be
said that, having exceptional grounds for good-will
towards me, he pays me exceptional dues of good-will
and runs the measure over, or that at least he imitates
and rivals me in my love; no, alas! he even hates
one who loves him, repels one who cherishes him,
injures one who helps him, and disowns one who
clings to him. Aye, though the laws are kindly to
children, he employs them against me as if they
were unkindly. Ah, what a conflict you wish to
precipitate, father, between the laws and nature !
Truly, truly, this matter is not as you will have it
tobe. Youillinterpret the laws, father, for they are
well made. Nature and law are not at war in the
matter of good-will; they go hand in hand there,
and work together for the righting of wrongs. You
mistreat your benefactor; you wrong nature. Why
wrong the laws, as well as nature? They mean to
be good, and just, and kindly to children, but you will
not allow it, inciting them repeatedly against one
son as if his name were legion, and not suffering
them to rest contented with punishments when they
are willing to rest contented with demonstrations
of filial affection; and yet they were not made,
surely, as a menace to those who have done no
wrong. Indeed, the laws permit suit to be brought
on the charge of ingratitude against persons who do

1 The existence of a law making ingratitude (dyapio7ia)
actionable was part of the accepted tradition of the Greek
rhetorical seHnee (Sopater in Walz, Rhetores Graect, VIII,
175 and 239; Cyrus, tbsd., 391; cf. Seneca, de Benef., III, 6, 1).

not help those who have helped them.!_ But when a
man, besides failing to render like for like, even
deems it right to inflict punishment in return for
the very benefits that he has received, think whether
there is any exaggeration of injustice which he has
overlooked !
That it is neither possible for him to disown a
.son after having already once for all exhausted his
paternal right and made use of the laws, nor yet just
to thrust away one who has shown himself so great
a benefactor and exclude him from the house has
been, I think, sufficiently established. Therefore
let us now come to the ground of disownment and
let us see what the nature of the charge is. It is
_ hecessary to recur once more to the intent of the
lawgiver; for, suppose we grant you briefly the
right to disown as often as you wish and also concede
you this right even against your benefactor, you are
not to disown casually, I take it, or for any and eve
cause. The lawgiver does not say that the father
may disown for any reason that he may chance to
allege—that it is enough just to express the wish
and find a fault. Else why should we need a court?
No, he commits it to you, gentlemen of the jury,
to consider whether the father’s anger is based upon
just and sufficient grounds or not. This, then, is
what you should now look into. And IJ shall begin
with what immediately followed his insanity.
ing. The name of the action is included in the list given by
Pollux, VIII, 31, and Valerius Maximus (V, 3, ext. 3) says that
Athens had such a law. On the other hand, Xenophon
puts into the mouth of Socrates (Mem., II, 2,13; ef. Cyrop. I,
2,7) the statement that Athens took no cognisance of ingrati-
tude except toward parents, and Seneca (loc. cit.) says that
no nation except the Macedonians had a law against it,

The first act of his sanity was to set aside the dis-
ownment, and I was a saviour, a benefactor, all in
allto him. No charge, I take it, could go with that.
And as to what followed, what do you censure in all
of it? What service, what attention proper to a son
did I omit? When did I sleep away from home?
Of what ill-timed carouses, of what riotous revels do
you accuse me? What licentiousness has there
been? What pander have I assaulted? Who has
filed any charges? Nobody at all. Yet these are
the deeds for which the law especially sanctions dis-
ownment.
““ No, but your stepmother began to be ill.” Well,
do you accuse me of that, and demand satisfaction
for the illness? “No,” he says. What, then?
“* That when you are ordered to treat her, you do not
consent; and on that account would merit disown-
ment for disobeying your father.” Deferring for a
moment the question what sort of orders on his
part, when I cannot obey them, cause me to be
considered disobedient, I first assert simply that the
law does not allow him to issue all orders, and that I
am not obliged to obey all orders under all circum-
stances. In the matter of commands, sometimes
disobedience is unexceptionable, sometimes it justi-
fies anger and punishment. If you yourself are ill,
and I am indifferent; if you bid me manage the
household, and I am neglectful; if you direct me to
oversee the estate, and I am indiligent—all this and
the like of it affords reasonable grounds for a father’s
censure. But these other matters are within the dis-
cretion of us children, belonging as they do to our
callings and the exercise of them; particularly if
the father himself is in no way wronged. For

really, if a scribe’s father gives him the order,
“Write this, my boy, not that,” or a musician’s
father, ‘‘Play this tune, not that,” or a copper-
smith’s father, ‘‘ Forge things like this, not like that,”
would anyone put up with his disowning his son
because the son does not exercise his calling in
accordance with the views of the father? No one,
I think.
In the case of the medical profession, the more
distinguished it is and the more serviceable to the
world, the more unrestricted it should be for those
who practise it. It is only just that the art of heal-
ing should carry with it some privilege in respect to
the liberty of practising it; that no compulsion and
no commands should be put upon a holy calling,
taught by the gods and exercised by men of learn-
ing; that it should not be subject to enslavement
by the law, or to voting and judicial punishment, or
to fear and a father’s threats and a layman’s wrath.
. Consequently, if I were to say to you, as clearly and
expressly as this: ‘I am unwilling to give treatment,
and I do not do so, although Ican; my knowledge of
the profession is for my benefit alone and my father’s,
and to others I wish to be a layman,” what tyrant
so high-handed that he would constrain me to practise
my calling against my will? Such things should, in
my opinion, be amenable to entreaties and suppli-
cations, not to laws and fits of anger and courts: the
physician ought to be persuaded, not ordered; he
ought to be willing, not fearful; he ought not to be
haled to the bedside, but to take pleasure in coming
of his own accord. Surely his calling is exempt
from paternal compulsion in view of the fact that

physicians have honours, precedence, immunities,
and privileges publicly bestowed on them by states.
This, then, is what I might say without circum-
locution in behalf of my profession if you had had me
taught and had been at much pains and expense that
I might learn, and I were nevertheless reluctant to
undertake this one cure, which was possible. But as
things stand, consider how absolutely unreasonable
a thing you are doing in not allowing me to use my
own possession freely. I did not learn this profession
while I was your son or subject to your jurisdiction,
and yet I learned it for you (aye, you were the first to
profit by it) though I had no help from you towards
learning it. What teacher did you furnish money
for? What supply of drugs? None at all. No,
poor as I was, in want of necessities, and pitied by
my teachers, I got myself educated, and the assistance
towards learning which I had from my father was
grief, loneliness, poverty, the hatred of my family,
_ and the aversion of my kinsmen. In return for this,
do you now think fit to utilize my profession and wish
to be master of all that I acquired when you were
not my master? Be content if I have already done
you a good turn of my own accord, without previous
indebtedness to you, for then as now nothing could
have been required of meas an expressionof gratitude.
Surely my act of kindness should not become an
obligation for the future, nor should the fact that I
conferred a benefit of my own free will constitute a
reason that I should be ordered to do it against my
will; neither should it become customary that once a
"man has cured anybody, he must for ever treat all
those whom his former patient wishes him to treat.
Under those conditions we should have elected our

playing slave to them and executing all their orders.
What could be more inequitable than this? Because
I restored you to health in this way when you had
fallen severely ill, do you think that you are therefore
empowered to abuse my skill?
That is what I might have said if what he enjoined
upon me were possible, and I were refusing to obey
him in absolutely everything, and under compulsion.
But as things are, consider now what his commands
are like. ‘‘Since you have cured me,” says he,
“ from insanity, since my wife too is insane and has
the same symptoms ” (for so he thinks), ‘‘ and has
been given up by others in the same way, and since
you can do everything, as you have shown, cure her
too and free her forthwith from the disorder.”” That,
to hear it so simply put, might seem very reasonable,
particularly to a layman, inexperienced in matters
of medicine. But if you will listen to my plea on
behalf of my profession, you will discover that all
things are not possible to us, that the natures of
ailments are not alike, that the cure is not the same
or the same medicines effective in all cases; and
then it will be clear that there is a great difference

and unseasonable.
In the first place, the natures and temperaments of
human bodies are not the same, although they are

admittedly composed of the same elements, but
some contain more, or perhaps less, of this, others
of that. And I say further that even the bodies of
males are not all equal or alike either in tempera-
ment or in constitution. So it is inevitable that the
diseases which arise in them should be different both
in intensity and in kind, and that some bodies should
be easy to cure and amenable to treatment, while
others are completely hopeless, being easily affected
and quickly overcome. Therefore, to think that all
fevers or consumptions or inflammations of the lungs
or madnesses, if of one and the same kind, are alike
in all bodies is not what one expects of sound-minded,
sensible men who have investigated such matters.
No, the same ailment is easy to cure in this person
but not in that. Just so, I take it, with wheat;
if you cast the same seed into different plots of ground,
it will grow in one way in the ground that is level,
deep-soiled, well watered, blessed with sunshine
and breezes, and thoroughly tilled, yielding a full,
rich, abundant harvest, no doubt, but otherwise in a
stony farm on a mountain, or in ground with little
sun, or in the foothills; to put it generally, in
different ways according to the various soils. So too
diseases become prolific and luxuriant or less so
through the soils which receive them. Omitting
this point and leaving it entirely uninvestigated, my
father expects all attacks of insanity in all bodies to
be alike and their treatment the same.
In addition to these important distinctions, it is
easy to grasp the fact that the bodies of women differ
very widely from those of men, both in respect to

the dissimilarity of their diseases and in respect to
one’s hopefulness or despair of a cure. For the
bodies of men are well-knit and sinewy, since they
have been trained by toils and exercises, and by an
open-air life; but those of women are weak and
soft from being reared indoors, and white for lack of
blood, deficiency of heat, and an excessive supply
of the moist humour. They are therefore more
susceptible than those of men, prone to diseases,
intolerant of medical treatment, and above all, more
liable to attacks of insanity ; for since women have
much bad temper, frivolity, and instability, but little
physical strength, they easily fall into this affection.
It is not right, then, to ask of the physicians the
same treatment for both, when we know that there
is a great gulf between them, dissociated as they have
been from the very first in their entire mode of life,
and in all their activities and all their pursuits. So
when you say “It is a case of insanity,’’ add, “ in-
sanity in a woman,” and do not confuse all these
variations by subsuming them under the title of
insanity, which seems always one and the same
thing, but distinguish them, as is right, in their
nature and see what can be done in each case. That
is what we do, for, as I remember telling you in the
beginning of my speech, the first thing that we con-
sider is the constitution and temperament of the
patient’s body, what quality predominates in it,
whether it is inclined to be hot or cold, whether it is

than any other in Lucian, is right. Its use as a synonym
of AnOdpa, though not recognised in the dictionaries, is
abundantly documented in Galen; e.g., De San. Tuenda,

vigorous or senile, tall or short, fat or lean, and
everything of that sort. In short, if a man examines
into these matters to begin with, he will be very
trustworthy when he expresses any doubt or makes
any promise.
To be sure, of madness itself there are countless
varieties, with many causes and even dissimilar
names; for perversity, eccentricity, delirium, and
lunacy are not the same thing, but are all names
that signify whether one is more or less in the grip
of the disease. The causes, too, are of one sort
with men, another with women, and even among
men they are of one sort with the young and
different with the aged; for instance, with the young
usually excess of humours, whereas in the case of the
old, groundless prejudice and insensate anger against
members of the family, attacking them frequently,
disturbs them at first, then gradually deranges them
to the point of insanity. Women are affected by
many things which easily incline them to this
ailment, especially by excessive hatred of someone,
or jealousy of an enemy who is prospering, or grief of
some sort, or anger; these passions, slowly smoulder-
ing and acquiring strength in a long lapse of time,
produce madness.
That, father, is what has happened to your wife,
and it may be that something has grieved her re-
cently, for she, of course, hated nothing at all. How-
ever that may be, she has a seizure, at all events, and
in the circumstances cannot be cured by a physician.
If anyone else should engage to do it, if anyone —
should relieve her, you may then hate me as offending

against you. Indeed, father, I shall not hesitate to
say further that even if her case were not so wholly
desperate, but some hope of saving her still were in
sight, even then I should not have undertaken her
case lightly or ventured to prescribe for her out of
hand, fearing mischance and the slanderous tongues
of the common sort. You are aware that everybody
thinks that all stepmothers entertain some hatred
of their stepsons, even if they are good women, and
that in this they suffer from a sort of insanity affect-
ing women in common. Perhaps someone would
have suspected, if the ailment had gone badly and
the’ remedies had not been effective, that the treat-
ment had been malevolent and treacherous.
As regards your wife, father, the case stands thus,
and I tell you so after careful observation—she will
never be better, even if she takes medicine a thousand
times. For that reason it is not proper to make any
attempt, unless you are trying to force me into sheer
failure and wish to give me a bad name. Let me
continue to be envied by my fellow-practitioners !
If, however, you disown me again, I certainly,
though totally alone in the world, will not pray that
any adversity may befall you; but what if (Heaven
forfend !) your affliction returns once more? Some-
how it often happens that such afflictions, under
irritation, do recur. What shall I be required to do?
I will treat you even then, you may be sure, and
shall never desert the post which Nature has com-
manded sons to hold, nor ever, so far as in me lies,
forget my origin. And then, if you recover your
mind, may I expect you some day to take me back
again? Look! even now by these actions of yours
you are bringing on the disorder and provoking the

terrible plight, and yet you strain your lungs shout-
