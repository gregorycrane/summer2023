<head>THE DOWNWARD JOURNEY, OR THE TYRANT<note><p>A scene in the realm of Hades, showing that cobblers fare
better there than kings. The lower world is depicted also in
the Menippus and in the Dialogues of the Dead. All these
pleces were deeply influenced by Cynic satire and in particular by the Necyia of Menippus. Helm maintains that the
Downward Journey is based on a couple of scenes in the
Necyia which Lucian left unused in writing his Menippus
and subsequently worked up into a separate dialogue, prefixing an introduction of his own; but there is hardly
enough evidence to make this theory plausible, lect alone
incontestable.</p>
<p>The part played by the Fates is unusual. Instead of
Spinning destinies up aloft as in the Charon, two of them are
given a share in the convoying of souls to the underworld,Atropos turning them over to Hermes and C lotho presiding
over their reception at the ferry. Clotho’s function thus in
great measure duplicates that assigned to Aeacus.</p></note></head>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="1"><p>

<label>CHARON</label>
Well, Clotho, we have had this boat all ship-shape
and thoroughly ready to sail for some time. The
water is baled out, the mast is set up, the sail is
hoisted in stops and each of the oars has a lanyard to
it, so that as far as I am concerned there is nothing
to hinder our getting up anchor and sailing. But
Hermes is behind hand; he should have been here
long ago. There is not a passenger aboard the ferryboat, as you see, when she might have made three
trips to-day by this time, and here it is almost dusk
and I haven’t earned even an obol yet. Besides,
Pluto will surely think I am taking it easy all this
time, when really someone else is to blame. Our
honourable guide of souls<ref n="3.1"/> has had a drink of Lethewater up there if ever a man did, and so has forgotten
to come back to us: he is either wrestling a fall with
the boys or playing a tune on the lyre or making
speeches to show off his command of piflle, or maybe
the gentleman is even playing sneak-thief, for that is
one of his accomplishments also. Anyhow, he takes
<note n="3.1">Hermes.</note>

<pb n="5"/>

liberties with us as if he were free, when really
he is half ours.<ref n="5.1"/>

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="2"><p>

<label>CLOTHO</label>
But, Charon, how do you know that he hasn’t
found something to keep him busy? Zeus may have
wanted to make more use of him than usual in
affairs up above. He too is his master.
</p>
<p><label>CHARON</label>
Yes, Clotho, but he has no right to go too far in
playing the master over joint property, for we
on our part have never kept Hermes back when
he had to go. No, I know the reason: here with
us there is nothing but asphodel and libations and
funeral-cakes and offerings to the dead, and all else
is misty, murky darkness ; in heaven, however, it is
all bright, and there is ambrosia in plenty and nectar
without stint, so it is likely that he finds it more
pleasant to tarry there. And when he leaves us he
flies up as if he were escaping from jail, but when it
is time to come down he comes with reluctance, at
the last moment, slowly and afoot.

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="3"><p>

<label>CLOTHO</label>
Don’t be angry any longer, Charon; here he is
close by, you see, bringing us a lot of people, or I
should say waving them along with his wand, all in
a huddle, like a herd of goats. But what’s this?
There is a man in fetters among them and another
who is laughing, I see, and one fellow with a wallet
over his shoulder and a club in his hand, who has a
piercing eye and hurries the others along. Don’t
you see, too, that Hermes himself is dripping with
sweat and dusty-footed and panting? In fact, he is
<note n="5.1">Like a slave in the upper world, Charon identifies himself with his master Pluto.</note>

<pb n="7"/>

gasping for breath. What’s all this, Hermes?
What’s the excitement? You seem to be in a stew,
you know.
</p>
<p><label>HERMES</label>
Why, Clotho, this miserable sinner ran away and I
chased him, and so almost failed to make your boat
to-day, that’s all!
</p>
<p><label>CLOTHO</label>
Who is he, and what was his object in trying to
run away?
</p>
<p><label>HERMES</label>
That’s easy to see—he preferred to live! He isa
king or a tyrant, to judge from his lamentations and
the wailing that he makes, in which he makes out
that he has had great happiness taken away from
him.
</p>
<p><label>CLOTHO</label>
So the poor fool tried to run away, thinking that
he could live longer, when the thread of life apportioned to him had already run short?
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="4"><p>

<label>HERMES</label>
Tried to run away, do you say? Why, if this
splendid fellow, the one with the stick, had not
helped me and we had not caught and bound him, he
would have got clean away from us. You see, from
the moment Atropos turned him over to me he kept
straining and pulling back every inch of the way,
and as he braced his feet on the ground he was by
no means easy to lead; sometimes, too, he would
beg and entreat, wanting to be let go for a little
while and promising a heavy bribe. Of course I did
not let him go, for I saw that what he was after
was impossible. But when we were right by the

entrance, while I was counting the dead for Aeacus<ref n="9.1"/>
as usual and he was comparing them with the tally
sent him by your sister, he gave us the slip somehow
or other, curse him, and made off. Consequently we
were one dead man short in the reckoning, and
Aeacus raised his eyebrows and said : “Don’t be too
promiscuous, Hermes, in plying your thievery; be
content with your pranks in Heaven. The accounts
of the dead are carefully kept and cannot be falsified.
The tally has a thousand and four marked on it, as
you see, and you come to me with one less. You
aren’t going to say that Atropos cheated you in the
reckoning ?” What he said made me blush, but I
speedily recalled what had happened on the way,
and when, after glancing about me, I did not see
this fellow anywhere, I perceived that he had escaped
and pursued with all the speed I could muster along
the road leading toward the light. My good friend
here followed me of his own free will, and by running
as if in a match we caught him just at Taenarus:<ref n="9.2"/>
that was all he lacked of escaping.
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="5"><p>
<label>CLOTHO</label>
And we, Charon, were condemning Hermes for
neglecting his duty, indeed !
</p>
<p><label>CHARON</label>
Well, why do we keep dilly-dallying as though we
had not had delay enough already.
</p>
<p><label>CLOTHO</label>
Right ; let them get aboard. I will hold the book
and sit by the gangway as usual, and as each of them

from, and how he met his death ; you receive them,
and as you do so, pack and stow them. LTlermes,
heave these babies aboard first, for what in the world
can they have to say to me?
</p>
<p><label>HERMES</label>
Here you are, ferryman, three hundred of them,
including those that were abandoned.
</p>
<p><label>CHARON</label>
I say, what a rich haul! It’s green-grape dead
you have brought us.
</p>
<p><label>HERMES</label>
Clotho, do you want us to get the unmourned
aboard next ?
</p>
<p><label>CLOTHO</label>
You mean the old people? Yes, for why should I
bother now to investigate what happened before the
food?<ref n="11.1"/> All of you who are over sixty go in now.
What’s this? They don’t heed me, for their ears are
stopped with years. You will probably have to pick
them up and carry them in, too.
</p>
<p><label>HERMES</label>
Here you are again, three hundred and _ninetyeight, all tender and ripe and harvested in season.
</p>
<p><label>CHARON</label>
Good Lord, yes! They’re all raisins now !

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="6"><p>

Bring in the wounded next, Hermes. (To the
DEAD) First tell me what deaths brought you

pass you. Eighty-four should have died in battle
yesterday in Media, among them Gobares, the son of
Oxyartas.
</p>
<p><label>HERMES</label>
Here they are!
</p>
<p><label>CLOTHO</label>
Seven committed suicide for love, among them the
philosopher Theagenes for the courtesan from
Megara.<ref n="13.1"/>
<label>HERMES</label>
Right here beside you.
</p>
<p><label>CLOTHO</label>
Where are the men who killed each other fighting
for the throne?
</p>
<p><label>HERMES</label>
Here they stand.
</p>
<p><label>CLOTHO</label>
And the man who was murdered by his wife and
her lover ?
</p>
<p><label>HERMES</label>
There beside you.
</p>
<p><label>CLOTHO</label>
Now bring in the output of the courts, I mean
those who died by the scourge and the cross. And
where are the sixteen who were killed by pirates,
Hermes ?
<note n="13.1">This man can hardly be other than the Cynic of Patras mentioned in The Passing of Peregrinus, who died in the teign of Marcus Aurelius. To be sure, Galen says he was killed by his doctor (x, p. 909), but he may well have been alive when Lucian wrote this.</note>

<label>HERMES</label>
Here they are, these wounded men whom you see.
Do you want me to bring in all the women
together ?
</p>
<p><label>CLOTHO</label>
By all means, and also those lost at sea, for they
died in the same way. And those who died of the
fever, bring them in together, too, and their doctor
Agathocles along with them.

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="7"><p>
Where is the philosopher Cyniscus, who was to die from eating the
dinner of Hecate and the lustral eggs and a raw
squid besides ?<ref n="15.1"/>
<label>CYNISCUS</label>
Ihave been standing at your elbow a long time,
kind Clotho. What have I done that you should leave
me on earth so long? Why, you nearly ran off your
whole spindle for me! In spite of that, I have often
tried to cut the thread and come, but somehow or
other it could not be broken.
</p>
<p><label>CLOTHO</label>
I left you behind to observe and prescribe for
the sins of man. But get aboard, and good luck to
you. :
</p>
<p><label>CYNISCUS</label>
No, by Heaven, not till we have put this man in
fetters aboard. I am afraid he may come it over you
with his entreaties.
<note n="15.1">The dinner of Hecate (mentioned also in Dialogues of the Dead, 1) was a purificatory offering made at cross-roads and,to judge from Aristophanes (Plutus 594), very well received by the poor. For the use of eggs in purification see Ovid, Ars Amat. ii. 329; Juv. vi. 517. The raw squid is mentioned because Diogenes is said to have died from eating one (Diog. Laert. 156 ap; cf. Philosophers for Sale, 10).</note>

<label>CLOTHO</label>
Come, let’s see who he is.
</p>
<p><label>CYNISCUS</label>
Megapenthes,<ref n="17.1"/> son of Lacydes, a tyrant.
</p>
<p><label>CLOTHO</label>
Aboard with you !
</p>
<p><label>MEGAPENTHES</label>
Oh no, good lady Clotho! Do let me go back to
earth for a little while. Then [ll come of my own
accord, you will find, without being summoned by
anyone.
</p>
<p><label>CLOTHO</label>
Why is it that you want to go back ?
</p>
<p><label>MEGAPENTHES</label>
Let me finish my house first, for the building has
been left half-done.
</p>
<p><label>CLOTHO</label>
Nonsense! Come, get aboard.
</p>
<p><label>MEGAPENTHES</label>
It’s not much time that I ask for, Lady of Destiny ;
let me stay just this one day, till I can give my wife
directions about my money—the place where I kept
my great treasure buried.
</p>
<p><label>CLOTHO</label>
It is settled ; you can’t be permitted.
</p>
<p><label>MEGAPENTHES</label>
Then is all that gold to be lost?
</p>
<p><label>CLOTHO</label>
No, it will not be lost. Be easy on that score
your cousin Megacles will get it.
<note n="17.1">«“Greatwoe.”</note>
<pb n="19"/>

<label>MEGAPENTHES</label>
What an outrage! My enemy, whom I was too
easy-going to put to death before I died ?
</p>
<p><label>CLOTHO</label>
The very man ; and he will outlive you forty years
and a little more, taking over your concubines and
your clothing and all your plate.
</p>
<p><label>MEGAPENTHES</label>
You are unjust, Clotho, to bestow my property on
my worst enemies.
</p>
<p><label>CLOTHO</label>
Why, did not it formerly belong to Cydimachus,
and did not you take it over after killing him and
slaughtering his children upon him while the breath
was still in his body ?
</p>
<p><label>MEGAPENTHES</label>
But it was mine now.
</p>
<p><label>CLOTHO</label>
Well, the term of your ownership has now expired.

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="9"><p>

<label>MEGAPENTHES</label>
Listen, Clotho, to something that I have to say to
you in private, with nobody else listening. (Yo the
others.) You people stand aside a moment. (Yo ctoruo)
If you let me run away, I promise to give you a
thousand talents of coined gold to-day.
</p>
<p><label>CLOTHO</label>
What, you ridiculous creature, have you gold and
talents still on the brain ?
</p>
<p><label>MEGAPENTHES</label>
And_ I'll give you also, if you wish, the two winebowls that I got when I put Cleocritus to death ;
they are of refined gold and weigh a hundred talents
each.

<pb n="21"/>


<label>CLOTHO</label>
Hale him off: it seems that he won’t go aboard
willingly.
</p>
<p><label>MEGAPENTHES</label>
I call you all to witness, the town wall and the
docks remain unfinished. I could have finished them
if I had lived only five days longer.
</p>
<p><label>CLOTHO</label>
Never mind ; someone else will build the wall.
</p>
<p><label>MEGAPENTHES</label>
But this request at all events is reasonable.
</p>
<p><label>CLOTHO</label>
What request ?
</p>
<p><label>MEGAPENTHES</label>
To live only long enough to subdue the Pisidians
and subject the Lydians to tribute, and to build
myself a huge mausoleum and inscribe on it all the
great military exploits of my life.
</p>
<p><label>CLOTHO</label>
Why, man, you are no longer asking for this one
day, but for a stay of nearly twenty years !

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="10"><p>

<label>MEGAPENTHES</label>
But I tell you I am ready to give bail for my
speedy return. If you wish, I’ll even surrender you
my beloved as a substitute for myself.
</p>
<p><label>CLOTHO</label>
Vile wretch! Have not you often prayed that he
night outlast you on earth?
</p>
<p><label>MEGAPENTHES</label>
That was long ago, but now I perceive whawi is for
the best.

<pb n="23"/>

<label>CLOTHO</label>
He too will soon be here, you'll find, slain by the
new ruler.

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="11"><p>
<label>MEGAPENTHES</label>
Well, at all events don't refuse me this, Lady of
Destiny. ,
</p>
<p><label>CLOTHO</label>
What ?
</p>
<p><label>MEGAPENTHES</label>
I want to know how things will turn out after my
death.
</p>
<p><label>CLOTHO</label>
Listen, for it will vex you all the more to know.
Midas, your slave, will have your wife ; indeed, he
has been her lover a long time.
</p>
<p><label>MEGAPENTHES</label>
Curse him, I set him free at her request !
</p>
<p><label>CLOTHO</label>
Your daughter will be enrolled among the concubines of the present tyrant, and the busts and
statues which the city long ago set up in your
honour will all be pulled down and will make everyone who looks at them laugh.
</p>
<p><label>MEGAPENTHES</label>
Tell meé, will none of my friends get angry at these
doings ?
</p>
<p><label>CLOTHO</label>
Why, what friend did you have, and how did you
make him? Don’t you know that all those who
bowed the knee and praised your every word and
deed did so either from hope or from fear, being
23
<pb n="25"/>

friends of your power, not of you, and keeping their
eyes on the main chance?
</p>
<p><label>MEGAPENTHES</label>
But as they poured their libations at our drinking
parties they used to pray at the top of their voices
that many blessings might descend upon me, saying
every one of them that he was ready to die for me if
so might be ; in a word, they swore by me.
</p>
<p><label>CLOTHO</label>
Consequently, you died after dining with one of
them yesterday : it was that last drink he gave you
that sent you down here.
</p>
<p><label>MEGAPENTHES</label>
Then that is why I noticed a bitter taste. But
what was his object in doing it?
</p>
<p><label>CLOTHO</label>
You are asking me many questions when you ought
to get aboard.
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="12"><p>
<label>MEGAPENTHES</label>
There is one thing that sticks in my throat above
all, Clotho, and on account of it I longed to slip
back again to the light of day, if only for a
moment.
</p>
<p><label>CLOTHO</label>
What is that? It must be something tremendous.
</p>
<p><label>MEGAPENTHES</label>
As soon as Cario, my valet, saw that I was dead,
toward evening he came into the room where I lay,
having nothing to do, for nobody was doing anything,
not even guarding me, and brought in my mistress
Glycerium; they had been on good terms a long time,
25
<pb n="27"/>

Isuppose. Shutting the door, he began to make free
with her as though nobody was in the room, and
then, when he had enough of it, he gazed at me and
said: “You wretched little shrimp, you often gave
me beatings when I was not at fault.” With that he
pulled my hair and hit me in the face, and finally,
after clearing his throat raucously and spitting on
me, went away saying: “Off with you to the place
of the wicked!” I was aflame with rage, but could
not do a thing to him, for I was already stiff and
cold. And as for the wretched wench, when she
heard people approaching she smeared her eyes with
spittle as if she had been crying over me and
went away weeping and calling my name. If I
should catch them—

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="13"><p>

<label>CLOTHO</label>
Stop threatening and get aboard; it is already
time for you to make your appearance in court.
</p>
<p><label>MEGAPENTHES</label>
And who will dare to pass judgement on a tyrant?
</p>
<p><label>CLOTHO</label>
On a tyrant, no one, but on a dead man,
Rhadamanthus. You shall soon see him impose on
every one of you the sentence that is just and fits the
case. No more delay now!
</p>
<p><label>MEGAPENTHES</label>
Make me even a common man, Lady of Destiny,
one of the poor people; make me evenaslave instead
of the king that once I was. Only let me come to
life again!
27
<pb n="29"/>

<label>CLOTHO</label>
Where is the man with the club? You take hold
of him too, Hermes, and pull him in by the leg, for
he won’t go aboard willingly.
</p>
<p><label>HERMES</label>
Come along now, runaway. (Zo cuanon.) Take
this fellow, ferryman, and see here—mind you make
sure—
</p>
<p><label>CHARON</label>
No fear! he shall be lashed to the mast.
</p>
<p><label>MEGAPENTHES</label>
But I ought to sit on the quarter-deck !
</p>
<p><label>CLOTHO</label>
For what reason ?
</p>
<p><label>MEGAPENTHES</label>
Because I was a tyrant, God knows, and had a
regiment of guardsmen.
</p>
<p><label>CYNISCUS</label>
Then wasn’t Cario justified in pulling your hair, if
you were such a lout? But you'll get small joy of
your tyranny if I give you a taste of my club!
</p>
<p><label>MEGAPENTHES</label>
What, will a Cyniscus make bold to shake his staff
at me? Did I not come within an ace of tricing you
up to a cross the other day because you were too
free-spoken and sharp-tongued and censorious?
</p>
<p><label>CYNISCUS</label>
That is why you yourself will stay triced up to
the mast.
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="14"><p>
<label>MICYLLUS</label>
Tell me, Clotho, do you people take no account at
all of me? Is it because I am poor that I have to
get aboard last?
29
<pb n="31"/>

<label>CLOTHO</label>
And who are you ?
</p>
<p><label>MICYLLUS</label>
The cobbler Micyllus.
</p>
<p><label>CLOTHO</label>
So you are aggrieved at having to wait? Don’t
you see how much the tyrant promises to give us
if we will let him go for a little while? Indeed,
it surprises me that you are not equally glad of the
delay.
</p>
<p><label>MICYLLUS</label>
Listen, kind. Lady of Destiny; I have no great
liking for such gifts as the famous one of the
Cyclops,—to be promised “T’]l eat Noman last of all.”<ref n="31.1"/>
In truth, be it first, be it last, the same teeth are in
waiting. Besides, my position is not like that of the
rich; our lives are poles apart, as the saying goes.
Take the tyrant, considered fortunate his whole life
long, feared and admired by everybody ; when he
came to leave all his gold and silver and clothing and
horses and dinners and handsome favourites and
beautiful women, no wonder he was distressed and
took it hard to be dragged away from them. Somehow or other the soul is limed, as it were, to things
like these and will not come away readily because
it has been cleaving to them long; indeed, the ties
with which such men have the misfortune to be
bound are like unbreakable fetters. Even if they
are haled away by force, they lament and entreat,
you may be sure, and although they are bold in
everything else, they prove to be cowardly in
the face of this journey to Hades. At any rate,
they turn back and, like unsuccessful lovers, want to
<note n="31.1">Odyssey 9, 369.</note>
31

That is what yonder poor fool did, who not only ran
away on the road but heaped you with entreaties
when he got here.

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="15"><p>

But as for me, having nothing at
stake in life, neither farm nor tenement nor gold
nor gear nor reputation nor statues, of course I was
in marching order, and when Atropos did but sign to
me I gladly flung away my knife and my leather (I
was working on a sandal) and sprang up at once and
followed her, barefooted as I was and without even
washing off the blacking. In fact, I led the way,
with my eyes to the fore, since there was nothing in
the rear to turn me about and call me back. And
by Heaven I see already that everything is splendid
here with you, for that all should have equal rank
and nobody be any better than his neighbour is
more than pleasant, to me at least. And I infer that
there is no dunning of debtors here and no paying of
taxes, and above all no freezing in winter or falling
ill or being thrashed by men of greater consequence.
All are at peace, and the tables are turned, for we
paupers laugh while the rich are distressed and
lament.

<label>CLOTHO</label>
Indeed, I noticed some time ago that you were
laughing, Micyllus. What was it in particular that
made you laugh ?
</p>
<p><label>MICYLLUS</label>
Listen, goddess whom I honour most. As I lived
next door to Sir Tyrant on earth, I used to see quite
distinctly what went on at his house, and I then
thought him a very god; for I held him happy when
I saw the splendour of his purple, the number of his

<pb n="35"/>

attendants, his plate, his jewelled goblets, and his
couches with legs of silver; besides, the savour
of the dishes prepared for his dinner drove me to
distraction. Therefore he appeared to me a superman, thrice-blessed, better looking and a full royal
eubit taller than almost anyone else; for he
was uplifted by his good fortune, walked with a
majestic gait, carried his head high and dazzled all
he met. But when he was dead, not only did he cut
an utterly ridiculous figure in my eyes on being
stripped of his pomp, but I laughed at myself even
more than at him because I had marvelled at such a
worthless creature, inferring his happiness from the
savour of his kitchen and counting him lucky because
of his purple derived from the blood of mussels in
the Laconian Sea.

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="17"><p>

And he was not the only one
that I laughed at. When I saw the usurer Gnipho
groaning and regretting that he had not enjoyed his
money but had died without sampling it, abandoning
his property to that wastrel Rhodochares, who was
nextof kin to him and had the first claim on the estate
according to law, I could not control my laughter,
: especially when I called to mind how pale and
unkempt he always was, with a forehead full of
worries, feeling his riches only with the fingers with
which he reckoned up thousands and tens of thousands ashe gathered in, little by little, what was soon
to be poured out by that lucky dog Rhodochares.
But why not gonow? We can finish our laughing
during: the sail as we see them crying.

<p><label>RHADAMANTHUS</label>
The man is altogether free from marks, except for

erased, or rather, effaced. How is that, Cyniscus,
and how is it that you looked free from them at

</p>
<p><label>CYNISCUS</label>
I will tell you. For a long time I was a wicked
man through ignorance and earned many marks
thereby ; but no sooner had I begun to be a philosopher than I gradually washed away all the scars
from my soul.

that the cursed scoundrel did while he was a private
citizen I intend to pass over; but when he had
leagued himself with the boldest men and had got
together a bodyguard, and so had set himself over the
city and had become tyrant, he not only put to
death more than ten thousand people without a
hearing but confiscated their properties in each case ;
and after he had made himself extremely rich, he
did not leave a single form of excess untried,
but practised every sort of savagery and high-handedness upon his miserable fellow-citizens, ravishing
maids, corrupting boys, and running amuck in every
way among his subjects. And for his superciliousness,
his pride, and his haughtiness toward all he met you
never could exact from him a fitting penalty. It
would have been less dangerous to look steadily at
the sun than at this man. Then, too, in the matter
of punishments who could describe his cruel inventiveness? Why, he did not even let his closest kin
alone! And that all this is not mere empty calumny
against him you will soon find out if you summon
up the men he murdered—but no, they are here
unsummoned, as you see, and press about him and
throttle him. All these men, Rhadamanthus, have
met their death at the scoundrel’s hands, some of
them entrapped in plots because of pretty wives,
others because they were angry on account of sons
outrageously kidnapped, others because they were
rich, and others because they were honest and decent

and on the raison d'être of the gods. The dialogue is
written from the Cynic standpoint against the Stoics, and is one of those showing Menippean influence. It stands in somewhat the same relation to the Icaromenippus as the Downward Journey to the Menippus.</note></head>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="1"><p>

<label>CYNISCUS</label>
But, Zeus, I for my part won’t annoy you that
way by asking for wealth or gold or dominion,
which are, it seems, very desirable to most people,
but not very easy for you to give; at any rate I
notice that you generally turn a deaf ear to their
prayers. I should like to have you grant me only
a single wish, and a very simple one.
</p>
<p><label>ZEUS</label>
What is it, Cyniscus? You shall not be disappointed, especially if your request is reasonable, as
you say it is.
</p>
<p><label>CYNISCUS</label>
Answer me a question ; it isn’t hard.
</p>
<p><label>ZEUS</label>
Your prayer is indeed trivial and easy to fulfil;
so ask what you will.
</p>
<p><label>CYNISCUS</label>
It is this, Zeus: you certainly have read the
poems of Homer and Hesiod: tell me, then, is
what they have sung about Destiny and the Fates
true, that whatever they spin for each of us at
his birth is inevitable ?<ref n="61.1"/>
<note n="61.1">Homer, Iliad 20, 127; Hesiod, Theogony 218, 904.</note>
61
<pb n="63"/>

<label>ZEUS</label>
It is really quite true. There is nothing which
the Fates do not dispose; on the contrary, everything that comes to pass is controlled by their
spindle and has its outcome spun for it in each
instance from the very beginning, and it cannot
come to pass differently.
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="2"><p>

<label>CYNISCUS</label>
Then when this same Homer in another part of
his poem says :

<cit><quote><l>Take care lest ere your fated hour you go to
house in Hell<ref n="63.1"/></l></quote>
<bibl>Iliad20, 336</bibl></cit>

and that sort of thing, of course we are to assume
that he is talking nonsense ?
</p>
<p><label>ZEUS</label>
Certainly, for nothing can come to pass outside
the control of the Fates, nor beyond the thread
they spin. As for the poets, all that they sing
under the inspiration of the Muses is true, but
when the goddesses desert them and they compose
by - themselves, then they make mistakes and contradict what they said before. And it is excusable
that being mere men they do not recognize the
truth when that influence is gone which formerly
abode with them and rhapsodized through them.
</p>
<p><label>CYNISCUS</label>
Well, we'll assume this to be so. But answer
me another question. There are only three of
the Fates, are there not—Clotho, Lachesis, I believe,
and Atropos?
</p>
<p><label>ZEUS</label>
Quite so.
<note n="63.1">εἰσαφίκηαι: completes the line.</note>
63
<pb n="65"/>

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="3"><p>

<label>CYNISCUS</label>
Well then, how about Destiny and Fortune?
They are also very much talked of. Who are they,
and what power has each of them? Equal power
with the Fates, or even somewhat more than they?
I hear everyone saying that there is nothing more
powerful than Fortune and Destiny.
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="4"><p>
<label>ZEUS</label>
It is not permitted you to know everything, Cyniscus. But why did you ask me that question about
the Fates?
</p>
<p><label>CYNISCUS</label>
Just tell me something else first, Zeus. Are you
ods under their rule too, and must you needs be
ttached to their thread ?
</p>
<p><label>ZEUS</label>
We must, Cyniscus. But what made you smile?
</p>
<p><label>CYNISCUS</label>
I happened to think of those lines of Homer in
hich he described you making your speech in the
sembly of the gods, at the time when you threatied them that you would hang the universe upon a
rd of gold. You said, you know, that you would
t the cord down from Heaven, and that the other
ds, if they liked, might hang on it and try to
Il you down, but would not succeed, while you,
lenever you chose, could easily draw them all up,
nd the earth and the sea along with them.”<ref n="65.1"/> At
at time it seemed to me that your power was wontful, and I shuddered as I heard the lines; but I
now that in reality you yourself with your cord
and your threats hang by a slender thread, as you
<note n="65.1">liad 8, 24.</note>
65
<pb n="67"/>

admit. In fact, I think that Clotho would have a
better right to boast, inasmuch as she holds you,
even you, dangling from her spindle as fishermen
hold fish dangling from a rod.

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="5"><p>

<label>ZEUS</label>
I don’t know what you are driving at with these
questions.
</p>
<p><label>CYNISCUS</label>
This, Zeus—and I beg you by the Fates and by
Destiny not to hear me with exasperation or anger
when I speak the truth boldly. If all this is so, and
the Fates rule everything, and nobody can ever
change anything that they have once decreed, why
do we men sacrifice to you gods and make you great
offerings of cattle, praying to receive blessings from
you? I really don’t see what benefit we can derive
from this precaution, if it is impossible for us through
our prayers either to get what is bad averted or to
secure any blessing whatever by the gift of the gods.

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="6"><p>
<label>ZEUS</label>
I know where you get these clever questions—
from the cursed sophists, who say that we do not
even exert any providence on behalf of men. At
any rate they ask questions like yours out of
impiety, and dissuade the rest from sacrificing and
praying on the ground that it is silly ; for we, they
ay, not only pay no heed to what goes on among
you, but have no power at all over affairs on
‘arth. But they shall be sorry for talking in that
vay,
</p>
<p><label>CYNISCUS</label>
I swear by the spindle of Clotho, Zeus, they did
lot put me up to ask you this, but our talk itself as
67
<pb n="69"/>

it went on led somehow or other to the conclusion
that sacrifices are superfluous. But if you have no
objection I will question you briefly once more. Do
not hesitate to answer, and take care that your
answer is not so weak.
</p>
<p><label>ZEUS</label>
Ask, if you have time for such nonsense.

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="7"><p>
<label>CYNISCUS</label>
You say that all things come about through the
Fates?
</p>
<p><label>ZEUS</label>
Yes, I do.
</p>
<p><label>CYNISCUS</label>
And is it possible for you to change them, to unspin them ?
</p>
<p><label>ZEUS</label>
Not by any means.
</p>
<p><label>CYNISCUS</label>
Then do you want me to draw the conclusion or is
it patent even without my putting it into words ?
</p>
<p><label>ZEUS</label>
It is patent, of course ; but those who sacrifice do ©
not do so for gain, driving a sort of bargain, forsooth,
and as it were buying blessings from us ; they do so
simply to honour what is superior to themselves.
</p>
<p><label>CYNISCUS</label>
Even that is enough, if you yourself admit that
sacrifices are not offered for any useful purpose, but

slaves with men, and subject to the same mistresses,
the Fates. For their immortality will not suffice to
make them seem better, since that feature certainly
is far worse, because men are set free by death at
least, if by nothing else, while with you gods the
thing goes on to infinity and your slavery is eternal,
being controlled by a long thread.<ref n="71.1"/>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="8"><p>
<label>ZEUS</label>
But, Cyniscus, this eternity and infinity is blissful
for us, and we live in complete happiness.
</p>
<p><label>CYNISCUS</label>
Not all of you, Zeus; circumstances are different
with you as with us, and there is great confusion in
them. You yourself are happy, for you are king and
can draw up the earth and the sea by letting down a
well-rope, so to speak, but Hephaestus is a cripple
who works for his living, a blacksmith by trade, and
Prometheus was actually crucified once upon a time.<ref n="71.2"/>
And why should I mention your father (Cronus), who
is still shackled in Tartarus? They say too that you
gods fall in love and get wounded and sometimes
become slaves in the households of men, as did your
brother (Poseidon) in the house of Laomedon and
Apollo in the house of Admetus. This does not
seem to me altogether blissful; on the contrary,
some few of you are probably favoured by Fate and
Fortune, while others are the reverse. I say nothing
of the fact that you are carried off by pirates<ref n="71.3"/> even
as we are, and plundered by temple-robbers, and from
very rich become very poor in a second; and many

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="9"><p>

<label>ZEUS</label>
See here, your talk is getting insulting, Cyniscus,
and you will perhaps regret it some day.
</p>
<p><label>CYNISCUS</label>
Be chary of your threats, Zeus, for you know that
nothing can happen to me which Fate has not
decreed before you. I see that even the templerobbers I mentioned are not punished, but most of
them escape you; it was not fated, I suppose, that
they should be caught !
</p>
<p><label>ZEUS</label>
Didn’t I say you were one of those fellows that
abolish Providence in debate ?
</p>
<p><label>CYNISCUS</label>
You are very much afraid of them, Zeus, I don’t
know why. At any rate, you think that everything I
say is one of their tricks.
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="10"><p>
I should like to ask you,
though—for from whom can I learn the truth except
from you ?—what this Providence of yours is, a Fate
or a goddess, as it were, superior to the Fates, ruling
even over them?
</p>
<p><label>ZEUS</label>
I have already told you that it is not permitted
you to know everything. At first you said that you
would ask me only one question, but you keep
chopping all this logic with me, and I see that in
your eyes the chief object of this talk is to show
that we exert no providence at all in human affairs.
</p>
<p><label>CYNISCUS</label>
That is none of my doing: you yourself said not
long ago that it was the Fates who brought every-
73
<pb n="75"/>

thing to pass. But perhaps you repent of it and
take back what you said, and you gods lay claim
to the oversight, thrusting the Fates aside ?
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="11"><p>
<label>ZEUS</label>
By no means, but Fate does it all through us.
</p>
<p><label>CYNISCUS</label>
I understand ; you allege that you are servants and
assistants of the Fates. But even at that, the
providence would be theirs, and you are only their
instruments and tools, as it were.
</p>
<p><label>ZEUS</label>
What do you mean?
</p>
<p><label>CYNISCUS</label>
You are in the same case, I suppose, as the adze
and the drill of the carpenter, which help him
somewhat in his craft, and yet no one would say that
they are the craftsman or that the ship is the work
of the adze or the drill, but of the shipwright. Well,
in like manner it is Destiny who does all the building
and you at most are only drills and adzes of the
Fates, and I believe men ought to sacrifice to
Destiny and ask their blessings ‘from her instead of
going to you and exalting you with processions and
sacrifices. But no: even if they honoured Destiny
they would not be doing so to any purpose, for I don’t
suppose it is possible even for the Fates themselves
to alter or reverse any of their original decrees about
each man. Atropos, at all events, would not put up
with it if anyone should turn the spindle backwards
and undo the work of Clotho.

<pb n="77"/>
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="12"><p>
<label>ZEUS</label>
Have you gone so far, Cyniscus, as to think that
even the Fates should not be honoured by men?
Why, you seem inclined to upset everything. As for
us gods, if for no other reason, we may fairly be
honoured because we are soothsayers and foretell all
that the Fates have established.
</p>
<p><label>CYNISCUS</label>
On the whole, Zeus, it does no good to have
foreknowledge of future events when people are
completely unable to guard against them,—unless
perhaps you maintain that a man who knows in
advance that he is to die by an iron spear-head can
escape death by shutting himself up? No, it is impossible, for Fate will take him out hunting and
deliver him up to the spear-head, and Adrastus,
throwing his weapon at the boar, will miss it and
slay the son of Croesus, as if the javelin were sped
at the lad by a powerful cast of the Fates.<ref n="77.1"/>

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="13"><p>

Indeed,
the oracle of Laius is really ridiculous :
<cit><quote><l>Sow not the birth-field in the gods’ despite,</l>

<l>For if thou get’st, thy son will lay thee low.</l></quote>
<bibl>Euripides, Phoenissae, 18-19</bibl></cit>

It was superfluous, I take it, to caution against what
was bound to be so in any event. Consequently
after the oracle he sowed his seed and his son laid
him low. I don’t see, therefore, on what ground you
demand your fee for making prophecies. I say
nothing of the fact that you are accustomed to give
most people perplexed and ambiguous responses,
not making it at all clear whether the man who

crosses the Halys will cause the loss of his own
kingdom or that of Cyrus; for the oracle can be
taken in either sense.<ref n="79.1"/>
<label>ZEUS</label>
Apollo had some reason for being angry at Croesus
because he had tested him by stewing lamb and
turtle together.<ref n="79.2"/>
<label>CYNISCUS</label>
He should not have been angry, being a god.
However, the very deception of the Lydian was predetermined, I suppose, and in general our lack of
definite information about the future is due to the
spindle of Destiny; so even your soothsaying is in
her province.

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="14"><p>

<label>ZEUS</label>
Then you leave nothing for us, and we are gods to
no purpose, not contributing any providence to the
world and not deserving our sacrifices, like drills or
adzes in very truth? Indeed, it seems to me that
you scorn me with reason, because although, as_ you
see, I have a thunderbolt clenched in my hand, I am
letting you say all this against us.
</p>
<p><label>CYNISCUS</label>
Strike, Zeus, if it is fated that I am really to be
struck by lightning, and I won’t blame you for the
stroke but Clotho, who inflicts the injury through

would not be the cause of the injury. There is
another question, however, which I will put to you
and to Destiny, and you can answer for her. You have
put me in mind of it by your threat.

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="15"><p>

Why in the
world is it that, letting off the temple-robbers and
pirates and so many who are insolent and violent
and forsworn, you repeatedly blast an oak or a stone
or the mast of a harmless ship, and now and then
an honest and pious wayfarer?<ref n="81.1"/> Why are you silent,
Zeus? Isn’t it permitted me to know this, either ?

<p><label>ZEUS</label>
No, Cyniscus. You are a meddler, and I can’t
conceive where you got together all this stuff that
you bring me.
</p>
<p><label>CYNISCUS</label>
Then I am not to put my other question to you
and to Providence and Destiny, why in the world is
it that honest Phocion and Aristides before him died
in so great poverty and want, while Callias and
Alcibiades, a lawless pair of lads, and high-handed
Midias and Charops of Aegina, a lewd fellow who
starved his mother to death, were all exceeding rich ;
and again, why is it that Socrates was given over to
the Eleven instead of Meletus, and that Sardanapalus,
ffeminate as he was, occupied the throne, while
Goches,<ref n="81.2"/> a man of parts, was crucified by him because
ie did not like what went on—not to speak in detail
f the present state of affairs, when the wicked and
he selfish are happy and the good are driven about

<pb n="83"/>

from pillar to post, caught in the pinch of poverty
and disease and other ills without number ?
</p>
<p><label>ZEUS</label>
Why, don’t you know, Cyniscus, what punishments
await the wicked when life is over, and in what happiness the good abide ?
</p>
<p><label>CYNISCUS</label>
Do you talk to me of Hades and of Tityus and
Tantalus and their like? For my part, when I die I
shall find out for certain whether there is really any
such thing, but for the present I prefer to live out
my time in happiness, however short it may be, and
then have my liver torn by sixteen vultures after my
death, rather than go as thirsty as Tantalus here
on earth and do my drinking in the Isles of the
Blest, lying at my ease among the heroes in the
Elysian Fields.

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="16"><p>

<label>ZEUS</label>
What’s that you say? Don’t you believe that
there are any punishments and rewards, and a court
where each man’s life is scrutinized !
</p>
<p><label>CYNISCUS</label>
I hear that somebody named Minos, a Cretan, acts
as judge in such matters down below. And please
answer me a question on his behalf, for he is your
son, they say.
</p>
<p><label>ZEUS</label>
What have you to ask him, Cyniscus?
</p>
<p><label>CYNISCUS</label>
Whom does he punish principally ?
</p>
<p><label>ZEUS</label>
wicked, of course, such as murderers and
temple-robbers.

<pb n="85"/>

<label>CYNISCUS</label>
And whom does he send to join the heroes ?
</p>
<p><label>ZEUS</label>
Those who were good and pious and lived
virtuously.
</p>
<p><label>CYNISCUS</label>
Why is that, Zeus?
</p>
<p><label>ZEUS</label>
Because the latter deserve reward and the former
punishment.
</p>
<p><label>CYNISCUS</label>
But if a man should do a dreadful thing unintentionally, would he think it right to punish him like
the others ?
</p>
<p><label>ZEUS</label>
Not by any means.
</p>
<p><label>CYNISCUS</label>
I suppose, then, if a man did something good unintentionally, he would not think fit to reward him,
either ?
</p>
<p><label>ZEUS</label>
Certainly not!
</p>
<p><label>CYNISCUS</label>
Then, Zeus, he ought not to reward or punish
anyone.
</p>
<p><label>ZEUS</label>
Why not?
</p>
<p><label>CYNISCUS</label>
Because we men do nothing of our own accord.

if what you previously admitted is true, that Fate is
the cause of everything If a man slay, it is she
who slays, and if he rob temples, he only does it

under orders. Therefore if Minos were to judge
justly, he would punish Destiny instead of Sisyphus
and Fate instead of Tantalus, for what wrong did
they do in obeying orders?

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="17"><p>

<label>ZEUS</label>
It isn’t proper to answer you any longer when you
ask such questions. You are an impudent fellow
and a sophist, and I shall go away and leave you
now. ;
</p>
<p><label>CYNISCUS</label>
I wanted to ask you just this one question, where
the Fates live and how they go into such minute detail in attending to so much business, when there
are only three of them. There is much labour and
little- good-fortune in the life they live, I think, with
all the cares they have, and Destiny, it would
appear, was not too gracious when they themselves
were born. At any rate if I were given a chance to
choose, I would not exchange my life for theirs, but
should prefer to be still poorer all my days rather
than sit and twirl a spindle freighted with so many
events, watching each carefully. But if it is not
easy for you to answer me these questions, Zeus,
I shall content myself with the answers you have
given, for they are full enough to throw light on the
doctrine of Destiny and Providence. The rest,
perhaps, I was not fated to hear !

to be ignored completely and count for nothing.

It can’t be that the earth has once more given

it was that fact that annoyed me most. Damis
asserted that gods did not even exist, to say nothing
of overseeing or directing events, whereas Timocles,
good soul that he is, tried to take our part. Then a

conversation ; they broke up after agreeing to finish

suspense to see which will get the better of it and
appear to have more truth on his side of the
argument. You see the danger, don’t you? We
are in a tight place, for our interests are staked
on a single man, and there are only two things
that can happen—we must either be thrust aside
in case they conclude that we are nothing but
names, or else be honoured as before if Timocles
gets the better of it in the argument.

But people won’t fail to know of it, Zeus, as the

common concern to all.

Assemble one and all! Come! We are to meet
about important matters.

Why, how do you want me to do it, Zeus?

How do I want you to do it? Ennoble your

eager to assemble.

Yes, but that, Zeus, is the business of epic poets

of the verses which Homer used in calling us together; of course you remember them.

<p><label>HERMES</label>
Not at all as distinctly and readily as I might, but
I'll have a try at it anyway :

<label>ZEUS</label>
Splendid, Hermes! an excellent proclamation,
that. Indeed, they are coming together already, so
take them in charge and seat each of them in his
proper place according to his material and workmanhip, those of gold in the front row, then next to
hem those of silver, then all those of ivory, then
hose of bronze or stone, and among the latter let
he gods made by Phidias or Alcamenes or Myron
t Euphranor or such artists have precedence and
et these vulgar, inartistic fellows huddle together
101
<pb n="103"/>

in silence apart from the rest and just fill out the
quorum.

</p>
<p><label>HERMES</label>
It shall be done, and they shall be seated properly ; but I had better find out about this; if one
of them is of gold and very heavy, yet not precise
in workmanship but quite ordinary and misshapen,
is he to sit in front of the bronzes of Myron and
Polyclitus and the marbles of Phidias and Alcamenes,
or is precedence to be given to the art?
</p>
<p><label>ZEUS</label>
It ought to be that way, but gold must have precedence all the same.
</p>
<p><label>HERMES</label>
I understand : you tell me to seat them in order
of wealth, not in order of merit; by valuation.
Come to the front seats, then, you of gold.

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="9"><p>

It is
likely, Zeus, that none but foreigners will occupy
the front row, for as to the Greeks you yourself see
what they are like, attractive, to be sure, and good
looking and artistically made, but all of marble or
bronze, nevertheless, or at most in the case of the
very richest, of ivory with just a little gleam of
gold, merely to the extent of being superficially
tinged and brightened, within while even these are
of wood and shelter whole droves of mice that keep
court inside. But Bendis here and Anubis over
there and Attis beside him and Mithras and Men
are of solid gold and heavy and very valuable
indeed.

Now why is it right, Hermes, for this dog-faced
fellow from Egypt<ref n="105.1"/> to sit in front of me when I am
Poseidon?
</p>
<p><label>HERMES</label>
That’s all very well, but Lysippus made you of
bronze and a pauper because the Corinthians had no
gold at that time, while this fellow is richer than you
are by mines-full. So you must put up with being
thrust aside and not be angry if one who has such

But I'll prove it to you by a competent witness,
Homer, who says all up and down his lays that I
am “golden Aphrodite.”
</p>
<p><label>HERMES</label>
Yes, and the same man said that Apollo was rich
in gold and wealthy, but now you'll see that he too
is sitting somewhere among the middle class, uncrowned by the pirates and robbed of the pegs of
his lyre. So be content yourself if you are not quite
classed with the common herd in the meeting.

But who would make bold to rival me, when I ain
Helius and so great in size? If the Rhodians had
not wanted to make me monstrous and enormous,
they might have made sixteen gods of gold at the
same expense, so in virtue of this I should be
considered more valuable. And I have art and precision of workmanship, too, for all my great size.
</p>
<p><label>HERMES</label>
What’s to be done, Zeus? This is a hard
question to decide, at least for me; for if I should
consider the material, he is only bronze, but if I compute how many thousands it cost to cast him, he
would be more than a millionaire.
</p>
<p><label>ZEUS</label>
Oh, why had he to turn up to disparage the
smallness of the others and to disarrange the
seating? See here, most puissant of Rhodians,
however much you may deserve precedence over
those of gold, how can you sit in the front row
unless everyone else is to be obliged to stand up so
that you alone can sit down, occupying the whole
Pnyx with one of your hams? Therefore you had
better stand up during the meeting and stoop over
the assembly.

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="13"><p>
<label>HERMES</label>
Here is still another question that is hard to solve.
Both of them are of bronze and of the same artistic
merit, each being by Lysippus, and what is more
they are equals in point of family, for both are sons
of Zeus—I mean Dionysus here and Heracles.
Which of them has precedence? Vor they are quarrelling, as you gee.

<pb n="109"/>

<label>ZEUS</label>
We are wasting time, Hermes, when we should
have been holding our meeting long ago, so for the
present let them sit promiscuously wherever each
wishes; some other day we shall call a meeting
about this, and I shall then decide what order of
precedence should be fixed in their case.

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="14"><p>
<label>HERMES</label>
Heracles ! what a row they are making with their
usual daily shouts: “Give us our shares!”’ “Where
is the nectar?” “The ambrosia is all gone!”
"Where are the hecatombs?” “Victims in common !”’
</p>
<p><label>ZEUS</label>
Hush them up, Hermes, so that they may learn
why they were called together, as soon as they have
stopped this nonsense.
</p>
<p><label>HERMES</label>
Not all of them understand Greek, Zeus, and I
am no polyglot, to make a proclamation that Scyths
and Persians and Thracians and Celts can understand. I had better sign to them with my hand,
I think, and make them keep still.
</p>
<p><label>ZEUS</label>
Do so.

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="15"><p>

<label>HERMES</label>
Good! There you have them, quieter than the
sophists. It is time to make your speech, then.
Come, come, they have been gazing at you this long
time, waiting to see what in the world you are going
to say.
</p>
<p><label>ZEUS</label>
Well, Hermes, I need not hesitate to tell you how

<pb n="111"/>

I feel, since you are my son. You know how confident and loud-spoken I always was in our meetings ?
</p>
<p><label>HERMES</label>
Yes, and I used to be frightened when I heard
you making a speech, above all when you threatened
to pull up the earth and the sea from their
foundations, with the gods to boot, letting down
that cord of gold.<ref n="111.1"/>
<label>ZEUS</label>
But now, my boy, I don’t know whether because
of the greatness of the impending disasters or
because of the number of those present (for the
meeting is packed with gods, as you see), I am
confused in the head and trembly and my tongue
seems to be tied ; and what is strangest of all, I have
forgotten the introduction to the whole matter, which
I prepared in order that my beginning might present
them “a countenance most fair.”<ref n="111.2"/>
<label>HERMES</label>
You have spoiled everything, Zeus. They are
suspicious of your silence and expect to hear
about some extraordinary disaster because you are
delaying.

Tut, tut! you gave ws enough of your parodies
in the beginning. If you wish, however, you can
stop your tiresome versification and deliver one of
Demosthenes’ speeches against Philip, any one you
choose, with but little modification. Indeed, that
is the way most people make speeches nowadays.
</p>
<p><label>ZEUS</label>
Good! That is a short cut to speechmaking and a
timely help to anyone who doesn’t know what to
say.

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="16"><p>

<label>HERMES</label>
Do begin, then.
</p>
<p><label>ZEUS</label>
Gentlemen of Heaven, in preference to great
riches you would choose, I am sure, to learn why it
is that you are now assembled. This being so, it
behoves you to give my words an attentive hearing.
The present crisis, gods, all but breaks out in
speech and says that we must grapple stoutly with
the issues of the day, but we, it seems to me, are
treating them with great indifference.<ref n="113.1"/> I now
Jesire—my Demosthenes is running short, you see
—to tell you plainly what it was that disturbed me
nd mmade me call the meeting.
Yesterday, as you know, when Mnesitheus the
1ip-captain made the offering for the deliverance of
's slip, which came near being lost off Caphereus,
e banqueted at Piraeus, those of us whom
nesitheus asked to the sacrifice. Then, after the
atioms, you all went in different directions, wherpy each of you thought fit, but I myself, as it was
Every late, went up to town to take my evening
<note n="113.1">Compare the beginning of Demosthenes’ first Olynthiac.</note>

<pb n="115"/>

stroll in the Potters’ Quarter, reflecting as I went
upon the stinginess of Mnesitheus. ‘To feast sixteen gods he had sacrificed only a cock, and a
wheezy old cock at that, and four cakes of frankincense that were thoroughly well mildewed, so that
they went right out on the coals and didn’t even
give off enough smoke to smell with the tip of your
nose ; and yet he had promised whole herds of cattle
while the ship was drifting on the rock and was
inside the ledges.
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="17"><p>

But when, thus reflecting, I had reached the
Painted Porch, I saw a great number of men gathered
together, some inside, in the porch itself, a number
in the court, and one or two sitting on the seats
bawling and straining their lungs. Guessing (as was
indeed the case) that they were philosophers of the
disputatious order, I decided to stop and hear what
they were saying, and as I happened to be wrapped
im one of my thick clouds, I dressed myself after
their style and lengthened my beard with a pull,
making myself very like a philosopher; then,
elbowing the rabble aside, I went in without being
recognized. I found the Epicurean Damis, that sly
rogue, and Timocles the Stoic, the best man in the
world, disputing madly : at least Timocles was sweating and had worn his voice out with shouting, while
Damnis with his sardonic laughter was making him
more and more excited.
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="18"><p>

Their whole discussion was about us. That confounded Damis asserted that we do not exercise any
providence in behalf of men and do not oversee
what goes on among them, saying nothing less than
that we do not exist at all (for that is of course what


<pb n="117"/>

his argument implied), and there were some who
applauded him. The other, however, I mean
Timocles, was on our side and fought for us and got
angry and took our part in every way, praising our
management and telling how we govern and direct
everything in the appropriate order and system ; and
he too had some who applauded him. But finally he
grew tired and began to speak badly and the crowd
began to turn admiring eyes on Damis; so, seeing
the danger, I ordered night to close in and break up
the conference. They went away, therefore, after
agreeing to carry the dispute to a conclusion the
next day, and I myself, going along with the crowd,
overheard them praising Damis’ views on their way
home and even then far preferring his side: there
were some, however, who recommended them not to
condemn the other side in advance but to wait and
see what Timocles would say the next day.

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="19"><p>

That is why I called you together, gods, and it is
no trivial reason if you consider that all our honour
and glory and revenue comes from men, and if they
are convinced either that there are no gods at all
or that if there are they have no thought of men,
we shall be without sacrifices, without presents and
without honours on earth and shall sit idle in Heaven
in the grip of famine, choused out of our old-time
feasts and celebrations and games and sacrifices and
vigils and processions. Such being the issue, I say
that all must try to think out something to save the
situation for us, so that Timocles will win and be
thought to have the truth on his side of the argument and Damis will be laughed to scorn by the
audience: for I have very little confidence that
117
<pb n="119"/>

Timocles will win by himself if he has not our
backing. Therefore make your lawful proclamation,
Hermes, so that they may arise and give counsel.
</p>
<p><label>HERMES</label>
Hark! Hush! No noise! Who of the gods in
full standing that have the right to speak wants to
do so? What’s this? Nobody arises? Are you
dumfounded by the greatness of the issues presented,
that you hold your tongues?

<cit><quote><l>Marry, you others may all into water and earth be
converted;<ref n="119.1"/></l></quote>
<bibl>Iliad7, 99.</bibl></cit>

but as for me, if I were privileged to speak frankly,
I would have a great deal to say.
</p>
<p><label>ZEUS</label>
Speak, Momus, with full confidence, for it is clear
that your frankness will be intended for our common
good.
</p>
<p><label>MOMUS</label>
Well then, listen, gods, to what comes straight
from the heart, as the saying goes. I quite expected
that we should wind up in this helpless plight and
that we should have a great crop of sophists like
this, who get from us ourselves the justification for
their temerity; and I vow by Themis that it is not
right to be angry either at Epicurus or at his
associates and successors in doctrine if they have
formed such an idea of us. Why, what could one
expect them to think when they see so much confusion in life, and see that the good men among
them are neglected and waste away in poverty and
<note n="119.1"></note>addressed to the Greeks by Menelaus when
they were reluctant to take up the challenge of Hector.

<pb n="121"/>

illness and bondage while scoundrelly, pestilential
fellows are highly honoured and have enormous
wealth and lord it over their betters, and that templerobbers are not punished but escape, while men who
are guiltless of all wrong-dving sometimes die by the
cross or the scourge ?

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="21"><p>

It is natural, then, that on seeing this they
think of us as if we were nothing at all, especially
when they hear the oracles saying that on crossing
the Halys somebody will destroy a great kingdom,
without indicating whether he will destroy his own
or that of the enemy ; and again

<cit><quote><l>“Glorious Salamis, death shalt thou bring to the
children of women,<ref n="121.1"/></l></quote>
<bibl>Herod. 7, 140 ff.</bibl></cit>
” !
for surely both Persians and Greeks were the
children of women! And when the reciters tell
them that we fall in love and get wounded and are
thrown into chains and become slaves and quarrel
among ourselves and have a thousand cares, and
all this in spite of our claim to be blissful and
deathless, are they not justified in laughing at us and
holding us in no esteem? We, however, are vexed
if any humans not wholly without wits criticize all
this and reject our providence, when we ought to be
glad if any of them continue to sacrifice to us,
offending as we do.
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="22"><p>

I beg you here and now, Zeus, as we are alone and
there is no man in our gathering except Heracles
and Dionysus and Ganymede and Asclepius, these
naturalized aliens—answer me truly, have you ever
had enough regard for those on earth to find out
<note n="121.1">From the famous oracle about the ‘* wooden wall,” which Themistocles interpreted for the Athenians.</note>

<pb n="123"/>

who are the good among them and who are the bad?
No, you can’t say that you have! In fact, if
Theseus on his way from Troezen to Athens had
not incidentally done away with the marauders, as
far as you and your providence are concerned nothing
would hinder Sciron and Pityocamptes and Cereyon
and the rest of them from continuing to live in
luxury by slaughtering wayfarers. Andif Eurystheus,
an upright man, full of providence, had not out of
the love he bore his fellow men looked into the
conditions everywhere and sent out this servant
of his,<ref n="123.1"/> a hard-working fellow eager for tasks, you,
Zeus, would have paid little heed to the Hydra and
the Stymphalian birds and the Thracian mares and
the insolence and wantonness of the Centaurs.

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="23"><p>
If you would have me speak the truth, we sit
here considering just one question, whether anybody is slaying victims and burning incense at our
altars ; everything else drifts with the current, swept
aimlessly along. Therefore we are getting and
shall continue to get no more than we deserve when
men gradually begin to crane their necks upward and
find out that it does them no good to sacrifice to us
and hold processions. Then in a little while you
shall see the Epicuruses and Metrodoruses and
Damises laughing at us, and our pleaders overpowered and silenced by them. So it is for the rest
of you to check and remedy all this, you who carried
it so far. To me, being only Momus, it does not
make much difference if I ain to be unhonoured, for
even in bygone days I was not one of those in
honour, while you are still fortunate and enjoy your
sacrifices.

<label>ZEUS</label>
Let us ignore this fellow’s nonsense, gods; he is
always harsh and fault-finding. As that wonderful
man Demosthenes says, to reproach and criticize and
find fault is easy and anyone can do it, but to advise
how a situation. may be improved requires a really
wise counsellor; and this is what the rest of you
will do, I am very sure, even if Momus says nothing.

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="25"><p>
<label>POSEIDON</label>
For my part I am pretty much subaqueous, as you
know, and live by myself in the depths, doing my
best to rescue sailors, speed vessels on their course
and calm the winds. Nevertheless I am interested
in matters here too, and I say that this Damis should
be put out of the way before he enters the dispute,
either with a thunderbolt or by some other means,
for fear that he may get the better of it in the
argument ; for you say, Zeus, that he is a plausible
fellow. At the same time we'll show them how we
punish people who say such things against us.
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="26"><p>
<label>ZEUS</label>
Are you joking, Poseidon, or have you completely
forgotten that nothing of the sort is in our power,
but the Fates decide by their spinning that one man
is to die by a thunderbolt, another by the sword
and another by fever or consumption? If it lay in
my power, do you suppose I would have let the
temple-robbers get away from Olympia the other
day unscathed by my thunderbolt, when they had
shorn off two of my curls weighing six pounds apiece?
Or would you yourself at Geraestus have allowed the
fisherman from Oreus to filch your trident? Besides,
125
<pb n="127"/>

it will look as if we were getting angry because we
have been injured, and as if we feared the arguments of Damis and were making away with him
for that reason, without waiting for him to be put
to the proof by Timocles. Shall we not seem, then,
to be winning by default if we win in that way?
</p>
<p><label>POSEIDON</label>
Why, I supposed I had thought of a short cut to
victory ?
</p>
<p><label>ZEUS</label>
Avast ! a stockfish idea, Poseidon, downright stupid,
to make away with your adversary in advance so that
he may die undefeated, leaving the question still in
dispute and unsettled !
</p>
<p><label>POSEIDON</label>
Well, then, the rest of you think of something
else that is better, since you relegate my ideas to the
stockfish in that fashion.

<label>APOLLO</label>
If we young fellows without beards were permitted
by law to take the floor, perhaps I might have made
some contribution to the debate.
</p>
<p><label>MOMUS</label>
In the first place, Apollo, the debate is on such
great issues that the right to speak does not go by
age but is open to all alike ; for it would be delicious
if when we were in direst danger we quibbled about
our rights under the law. Secondly, according to law _
you are already fully entitled to the floor, for you
came of age long ago and are registered in the list
of the Twelve Gods and almost were a member of
the council in the days of Cronus. So don’t play
the boy with us: say what you think boldly, and
127
<pb n="129"/>

don’t be sensitive about speaking without a beard
when you have such a long-bearded, hairy-faced son
in Asclepius. Besides, it would be in order for you
to show your wisdom now or never, unless you sit
on Helicon and talk philosophy with the Muses for
nothing.
</p>
<p><label>APOLLO</label>
But it is not for you to give such permission,
Momus; it is for Zeus, and if he lets me perhaps
I may say something not without sweetness and
light and worthy of my study on Helicon.
</p>
<p><label>ZEUS</label>
Speak, my boy: I give you permission.

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="28"><p>

<label>APOLLO</label>
This Timocles is an upright, God-fearing man and
he is thoroughly up in the Stoic doctrines, so that
he gives lessons to many of the young men
-and collects large fees for it, being very plausible
when he disputes privately with his pupils; but he
utterly lacks the courage to speak before a crowd
and his language is vulgar and half-foreign, so that
he gets laughed at for that reason when he appears
in public, for he does not talk fluently but stammers
and gets confused, especially when in spite of these
faults he wants to make a show of fine language.
His intellect, to be sure, is exceedingly keen and
subtle, as people say who know more than I about
Stoicism, but in lecturing and expounding he weakens
and obscures his points by his incapacity, not making
his meaning clear but presenting propositions that
are like riddles and returning answers that are still
more unintelligible; hence the others failing to com-


<pb n="131"/>

prehend, laugh at him. But it is essential to speak
clearly, I think, and beyond all else to take great
pains to be understood by the hearers.

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="29"><p>

<label>MOMUS</label>
You were right, Apollo, in praising people who
speak clearly, even though you yourself do not do
it at all, for in your oracles you are ambiguous and
riddling and you unconcernedly toss most of them
into the debatable ground so that your hearers need
another Apollo to interpret them. But what do
you advise as the next step, what remedy for
Timocles’ helplessness in debate ?

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="30"><p>

<label>APOLLO</label>
To give him a spokesman if possible, Momus, one of
those eloquent chaps who will say fittingly whatever
Timocles thinks of and suggests.
</p>
<p><label>MOMUS</label>
Truly a puerile suggestion which shows that you
still need a tutor, that we should bring a spokesman
into a meeting of philosophers to interpret the
opinions of Timocles to the company, and that Damis
should speak in his own person and unaided while
the other, making use of a proxy, privately whispers
his ideas into his ear and the proxy does the speaking,
perhaps without even understanding what he hears,
Wouldn’t that be fun for the crowd! No, let’s
think of some other way to manage this thing.

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="31"><p>

But
as for you, my admirable friend, since you claim to
be a prophet and have collected large fees for such
work, even to the extent of getting ingots of gold
once upon a time, why do you not give us a timely
display of your skill by foretelling which of the
131
<pb n="133"/>

sophists will win in the argument? Of course you
know what the outcome will be, if you are a
prophet: .
</p>
<p><label>APOLLO</label>
How can I do that, Momus, when we have no
tripod here, and no incense or prophetic spring like
Castaly ?
</p>
<p><label>MOMUS</label>
There now! you dodge the test when it comes to
the pinch.
</p>
<p><label>ZEUS</label>
Speak up, my boy, all the same, and don’t give
this libeller a chance to malign and insult your profession by saying that it all depends on a tripod and
water and incense, so that if you didn’t have those
things you would be deprived of your skill.
</p>
<p><label>APOLLO</label>
It would be better, father, to do such business at
Delphi or Colophon where I have all the necessaries
at hand, in the usual way. However, even thus
devoid of them and unequipped, I will try to foretell
whose the victory shall be: you will bear with me if
my verses are lame.
</p>
<p><label>MOMUS</label>
Do speak ; but let it be clear, and not itself in
need of a spokesman or an interpreter. It is not
now a question of lamb and turtle cooking together
in Lydia, but you know what the debate is about.
</p>
<p><label>ZEUS</label>
What in the world are you going to say, my boy?
These preliminaries to your oracle are terrifying in
themselves; your colour is changed, your eyes are
rolling, your hair stands on end, your movements are

frenzied, and in a word everything about you
suggests demoniacal possession and gooseflesh and
mysteries.

</p></div>

there is nothing to laugh at in the situation we are
facing. Stop, hang you! You'll choke yourself to
death with your laughing.

<label>HERACLES</label>
As for me, father, though I am but an alien I.shall
not hesitate to say what I think. When they have
met and are disputing, if Timocles gets the better
of it, let’s allow the discussion about us to proceed ;
but if it turns out at all adversely, in that case, if
you approve, I myself will at once shake the porch
and throw it down on Damis, so that he may not
affront us, confound him!
</p>
<p><label>ZEUS</label>
In the name of Heracles! that was a loutish,
horribly Boeotian thing you said, Heracles, to involve
so many honest men in the destruction of a single
rascal, and the porch too, with its Marathon and
Miltiades and Cynegirus!<ref n="137.1"/> If they should collapse
how could the orators orate any more? They would
be robbed of their principal topic for speeches.<ref n="137.2"/>
Moreover, although while you were alive you could
no doubt have done something of the sort, since you
have become a god you have found out, I suppose,
that only the Fates can do such things; and that we
have no part in them.
</p>
<p><label>HERACLES</label>
So when I killed the lion or the Hydra, the
Fates did it through my agency?

No, not by any means.

Then hear me frankly, Zeus, for as the comic

shall say good-bye forever to the honours here

I can at least frighten the ghosts of the animals I
have slain.

Bravo! testimony from the inside, as the saying
goes. Really you would have done us a great
service if you had given Damis a hint to say
that.

Tell me what I wanted you to tell me long ago,
how you were induced to believe that the gods
exercise providence.
</p>
<p><label>TIMOCLES</label>
In the first place the order of nature convinced
me, the sun always going the same road and the
moon likewise and the seasons changing and plants
growing and living creatures being born, and these
latter so cleverly devised that they can support life
and move and think and walk and build houses and
cobble shoes—and all the rest of it; these seem to
me to be works of providence.

That is just the question, Timocles, and you are
trying to beg it, for it is not yet proved that each of
<note n="147.1">Iliad, 1, 423.</note>

<pb n="149"/>

these things is accomplished by providence. While
I myself would say that recurrent phenomena are
as you describe them, I need not, however, at once
admit a conviction that they recur by some sort of
providence, for it is possible that they began at
random<ref n="149.1"/> and now take place with uniformity and
regularity. But you call necessity “order” and then,
forsooth, get angry if anyone does not follow you
when you catalogue and extol the characteristics of
these phenomena and think it a proof that each of
them is ordered by providence. So, in the words

the best poet ?

Yes, certainly,

Well, it was he that convinced me with his portrayal of the providence of the gods.

<p><label>DAMIS</label>
But, my admirable friend, everybody will agree
with you that Homer is a good poet, to be sure, but
not that he or any other poet whatsoever is a truthful
witness. They do not pay any heed to truth, I take
it, but only to charming their hearers, and to this
end they enchant them with metres and entrance

However, I should like to know what it
was of Homer’s that convinced you most. What he
says about Zeus, how his daughter and his brother
and his wife made a plot to fetter him?<ref n="151.1"/> If Thetis
had not summoned Briareus, our excellent Zeus would
have been caught and put in chains. For this he
returned thanks to Thetis by deceiving Agamemnon,
sending a false vision to him, in order that many of
the Achaeans might lose their lives.<ref n="151.2"/> Don’t you see,
it was impossible for him to hurl a thunderbolt and
burn. up Agamemnon himself without making
himself out a liar? Or perhaps you were most inclined to believe when you heard how Diomed
wounded Aphrodite and then even Ares himself at
the suggestion of Athena,<ref n="151.3"/> and how shortly afterwards
the gods themselves fell to and began duelling
promiscuously, males and females ;<ref n="151.4"/> Athena defeated
Ares, already overtaxed, no doubt by the wound he
had received from Diomed,<ref n="151.5"/> and


"Leto fought against Hermes, the stalwart god of
good fortune.”<ref n="151.6"/>
Or perhaps you thought the tale about Artemis
credible, that, being a fault-finding person, she got
angry when she was not invited to a feast by Oeneus
and so turned loose on his land a monstrous boar of
irresistible strength.<ref n="151.7"/> Did Homer convince you by
saying that sort of thing?

I suppose you don’t think that Euripides is telling
the truth either, when he puts the gods themselves
on the stage and shows them saving the herves and
destroying villains and impious fellows like yourself ?
</p>
<p><label>DAMIS</label>
Why, Timocles, you doughtiest of philosophers, if
the playwrights have convinced you by doing this,
you must needs believe either that Polus and Aristodemus and Satyrus are gods for the nonce, or that
the very masks representing the gods, the buskins, the trailing tunics, the cloaks, gauntlets, padded
paunches and all the other things with which they
make tragedy grand are divine; and that is
thoroughly ridiculous. I assure you when Euripides,
following his own devices, says what he thinks without being under any constraint imposed by the requirements of his plays, you will hear him speaking
frankly then :

<l>That lappeth earth about in yielding arms ?</l>

<label>TIMOCLES</label>
Well ‘then, all men and all nations have been mistaken in believing in gods and celebrating festivals ?
</p>
<p><label>DAMIS</label>
Thank you kindly, Timocles, for-reminding me of
what the nations believe... From that you can discern partitularly well that there is nothing in the
theory of gods, for the confusion is great, and some
believe one thing, some another. The Scythians
offer sacrifice to a scimitar, the Thracians to Zamolxis,
a runaway slave who came to them from Samos, the
Phrygians to Men, the Ethiopians to Day, the
Cyllenians to’ Phales, the Assyrians to a dove, the
Persians to fire, and the Egyptians to water. And
while all the Egyptians in common have water for a
god, the people of Memphis have the bull, the people
of Pelusium a wild onion, others an ibis or a crocodile,
others a dog-faced god or a cat or a monkey. Moreover, taking them by villages, some hold the right
shoulder a god and others, who dwell opposite them,
the left; others, half.a skull, and others an earthen
cup or dish. Isn’t that matter for laughter, good
Timocles?

dictions of coming events? whose work can you call
them except that of the gods and their providence ?
</p>
<p><label>DAMIS</label>
Don’t say a word about the oracles, my worthy
friend, or else I'l ask you which of them you want
to cite. The one that Apollo gave the Lydian, which
was thoroughly double-edged and two-faced, like
some of our Herms, which are double and just alike
on both sides, whichever way you look at them ; for
what was there to show that Croesus by crossing the
Halys would destroy his own kingdom rather than
that of Cyrus? And yet the luckless Sardian had

verse.

Why shouldn’t I hear thunder, Timocles? But
whether it is Zeus that thunders or not, you no
doubt know best, coming as you do from some place
or other where the gods live! However, the people
who come here from Crete tell us a different tale,
that a grave is pointed out there with a tombstone

Yes, often, Timocles.
</p>
<p><label>TIMOCLES</label>
Well, you were kept in motion then, were you not,
either by-the wind striking the canvas and filling the
sails, or else by the rowers, but the steering was
done by a single man in ‘command, who kept the
vessel safe ?
</p>
<p><label>DAMIS</label>
Yes, certainly.
</p>
<p><label>TIMOCLES</label>
Then do you suppose that while the ship would
not sail if she were not steered, this universe keeps
in motion unsteered and unofficered ?
</p>
<p><label>ZEUS</label>
Good! Timocles put that very shrewdly, with a
valid illustration.
</p>
<p><label>DAMIS</label>
Why, Timocles, you superlative admirer of the gods,
in the one case you would have seen the captain
always planning what had better be done and making
ready beforehand and giving orders to the crew, and


<pb n="163"/>

the ship would contain nothing at all that was
profitless and senseless, that was not wholly useful
and necessary to them for their voyage. But in the
other case your captain, the one who, you say, is in
command of this great ship, manages nothing in a
sensible or fitting way, and neither do the members
of his crew; the forestay is carried aft, maybe, and
both the sheets forward, the anchors are sometimes
‘of gold while the figurehead is of lead, and all the
ship’s underbody is painted while her upper works
are unsightly.

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="47"><p>
Among the sailors themselves you
will see that one who is lazy and lubberly and has
no heart for his work has a warrant or evena
commission, while another who is fearless at diving
and handy in manning the yards and best acquainted
with everything that needs to be done, is set to
pumping ship. So too with the passengers: you'll
see some gallows-bird or other sitting on the quarter
deck beside the captain and receiving attentions, and
another, a profligate, a parricide or a temple-robber,
getting inordinate honour and taking up the whole
deck of the ship, while a lot of good fellows are
crowded into a corner of the hold and trampled on
by men who are really their inferiors. Just think,
for example, what a voyage Socrates and Aristides
and Phocion had, without biscuits enough to eat and
without even room to stretch their legs on the bare
boards alongside the bilgewater, and on the other
hand what favours Callias and Midias and Sardanapalus enjoyed, rolling in luxury and spitting on
those beneath them !

That is what goes on in your ship, Timocles, you

greatest of sages, and that is why the disasters are
countless. But if there were really a captain in
command who saw and directed everything, first of
all he would not have failed to know who were the
good and who were the bad among the men aboard,
and secondly he would have given each man his due
according to his worth, giving to the better men the
better quarters beside him on deck and to the worse
the quarters in the hold; some of them he would
have made his messmates and advisers, and as for
the crew, a zealous man would have been assigned
to command forward or in the waist, or at any rate
somewhere or other over the heads of the rest, while
a timorous, shiftless one would get clouted over the
head half a dozen times a day with the rope’s end.
Consequently, my interesting friend, your comparison
of the ship would seem to have capsized for the want
of a good captain.

all of them easy to capsize.

<label>TIMOCLES</label>
See whether I frame this syllogism logically, and
whether you can capsize it in any way. If there are
altars, there are also gods; but there are altars,
ergo there are also gods. What have you to say to
that?

After I have laughed to my heart’s content I'll
tell you.

<p><label>TIMOCLES</label>
Well, it looks as if you would never stop laughing ;
tell me, though, how you thought what I said was
funny.
</p>
<p><label>DAMIS</label>
Because you do not see that your anchor is
attached to a slender string—and it’s your sheetanchor at that! Having hitched the existence of
gods to the existence of altars, you think you have
made yourself a safe mooring. So, as you say you
have no better sheet-anchor than this, let's be
going.

You admit your defeat, then, by going away first ?

Yes, Timocles, for like men threatened with

refuge at the altars. Therefore I vow by the sheetanchor, I want to make an agreement with you now,
right at the altars, not to dispute any more on this
topic.

Zeus, god of miracles, and Heracles, averter of

<p><label>COCK</label>
Then do you think it a miracle if I talk the same

Why isn’t it a miracle? Gods, avert the evil

It appears to me, Micyllus, that you are utterly uneducated and haven’t even read Homer’s poems, for in
them Xanthus, the horse of Achilles, saying good-bye
to neighing forever, stood still and talked in the
thick of the fray, reciting whole verses, not prose as
I did ; indeed he even made prophecies and foretold
the future; yet he was not considered to be doing
anything out of the way, and the one who heard him
did not invoke the averter of harm as you did just now,
thinking the thing ominous.<ref n="175.1"/> Moreover, what would
you have done if the stem of the Argo had spoken to
you as it spoke of old,<ref n="175.2"/> or the oak at Dodona had
prophesied with a voice of its own; or if you had
seen hides crawling and the flesh of oxen bellowing
half-roasted on the spits?<ref n="175.3"/> I am the friend of

Hermes, the most talkative and eloquent of all the
gods, and besides I am the close comrade and messmate of men, so it was to be expected that I would
learn the human language without difficulty. But if
you promise me to keep your own counsel, I shall
not hesitate to.tell you the real reason for my having
the same tongue as you, and how it happens that
can talk like this.
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="3"><p>

<label>MICYLLUS</label>
Why, this is not a dream, is it? A cock talking
to me this way? Tell me, in the name of Hermes,
my good friend, what other reason you have for your
ability to speak. As to my keeping still and not
telling anybody, why should you have any fear, for
who would believe me if I told him anything asserting
that I had heard it from a cock ?
</p>
<p><label>COCK</label>
Listen, then, to an account which will be quite
incredible to you, I am very sure, Micyllus. I who
now appear to you in the guise of a cock was a man
not long ago.
</p>
<p><label>MICYLLUS</label>
I heard something to that effect about you cocks a
good while ago. They say that a young fellow
named Alectryon (Cock) became friends with Ares
ind drank with the god and caroused with him and
shared his amorous adventures ; at all events, whenever Ares went to visit Aphrodite on poaching bent,
he took Alectryon along too ; and as he was especially
uspicious of Helius, for fear that he would look
down on them and tell Hephaestus, he always used
to leave the young fellow outside at the door to
warn him when Helius rose. Then, they say,
Alectryon fell asleep one time and unintentionally


<pb n="179"/>


betrayed his post, and Helius unexpectedly stole
upon Aphrodite with Ares, who was sleeping peacefully because he relied on Alectryon to tell him if
anyone came near. So Hephaestus found out from
Helius and caught them by enclosing and trapping
them in the snares that he had long before contrived
for them ; and Ares, on being let go in the plight in
which Hephaestus let him go,<ref n="179.1"/> was angry at Alectryon
and changed him into this bird, weapons and all, so
that he still has the crest of his helmet on his head.
And for this reason, they say, you cocks try to put
yourselves right with Ares when it is no use, and
when you notice that the sun is about to come up,
you raise your voices far in advance and give warning
of his rising.

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="4"><p>

<label>COCK</label>
That is what they say, Micyllus, I grant you; but
my own experience has been quite different, and it
is only just lately that I changed into a cock.
</p>
<p><label>MICYLLUS</label>
How? That is what I want to know above all
else.
</p>
<p><label>COCK</label>
Have you ever heard of a man named Pythagoras,
the son of Mnesarchus, of Samos?
</p>
<p><label>MICYLLUS</label>
You mean the sophist, the quack, who made laws
against tasting meat and eating beans, banishing
from the table the food that I for my part like best
of all, and then trying to persuade people that before he became Pythagoras he was Euphorbus (Well-
<note n="179.1">The story is told in the Odyssey 8, 300-366, and repeated by Lucian in Dialogues of the Gods, 21.</note>

fed)? They say he was a conjurer and a miraclemonger, cock.
</p>
<p><label>COCK</label>
I am that very Pythagoras, Micyllus, so stop
abusing me, my good friend, especially as you do not
know what sort of man I really was.
</p>
<p><label>MICYLLUS</label>
Now this is far more miraculous than the other
thing! A philosopher cock! Tell me, though, son
of Mnesarchus, how you became a cock instead of a
man and a Tanagriote instead of a Samian.<ref n="181.1"/> This
story is not plausible nor quite easy to believe, for
I think Ihave observed two things in you that are
quite foreign to Pythagoras.
</p>
<p><label>COCK</label>
What are they?
</p>
<p><label>MICYLLUS</label>
One thing is that you are very noisy and loudvoiced, whereas he recommended silence for five
whole years, I believe. The other is actually quite
illegal ; I came home yesterday, as you know, with
nothing but beans to throw you, and you picked
them up without even hesitating. So it must be
either that you have told a lie and are someone else,
or, if you are Pythagoras, you have broken the law
and committed as great an impiety in eating beans as
if you had eaten your father’s head.<ref n="181.2"/>
<note n="181.1">Tanagra in Boeotia was famous for its game-cocks.</note>
<note n="181.2">An allusion to the pseudo-Pythagorean verse ἶσόν τοι κυάμους τε φαγεῖν κεφαλάς τε τοκήων. (It is just as wrong for you to eat beans as to eat the heads of your parents).</note>

<pb n="183"/>
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="5"><p>
<label>COCK</label>
Why, Micyllus, you don’t know what the reason
for these rules is, and what is good for particular
modes of existence. Formerly I did not eat beans
because I was a philosopher, but now I can eat them
because they are fit food for a bird and are not forbidden to us. But listen if you like, and I'll tell
you how from Pythagoras I became what I am, and
what existences I formerly led, and what I profited
by each change.
</p>
<p><label>MICYLLUS</label>
Do tell me, for I should be more than delighted
to hear it. Indeed, if anyone were to let me choose
whether I preferred to hear you tell a story like that
or to have once more that blissful dream I had a
little while ago, I don’t know which would be my
choice; for in my estimation what you say is close
akin to the most delightful of visions, and I hold
you both in equal esteem, you and my priceless
dream.
</p>
<p><label>COCK</label>
What, are you still brooding on that vision, whatever it was that came to you, and are you still
cherishing idle delusions, hunting down in your
memory a vain and (as they say in poetry) disembodied happiness ?
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="6"><p>
<label>MICYLLUS</label>
Why, I shall never forget that vision, cock, you
may be sure. The dream left so much honied sweetness in my eyes when it went away that I can
hardly open my lids, for it drags them down in sleep
again. In fact, what I saw gave me as pleasant a
titillation as a feather twiddled in one’s ear.
183
<pb n="185"/>

<label>COCK</label>
Heracles! By what you say, Master Dream is an
adept indeed. Rumour says that he has wings and
can fly to the limit set by sleep, but now he “jumps
over the pit”<ref n="185.1"/> and lingers in eyes that are open,
presenting himself in a form so honey-sweet and
palpable. At all events I should be glad to hear
what he is like, since you hold him so very dear.
</p>
<p><label>MICYLLUS</label>
I am ready to tell; in fact, it will be delightful
to think and talk about it. But when are you going
to tell me about your transmigrations, Pythagoras?
</p>
<p><label>COCK</label>
When you stop dreaming, Micyllus, and rub the
honey out of your eyes. At present, you speak
first, so that I may find out whether it was through
the gates of ivory or the gates of horn that the
dream winged its way to you.
</p>
<p><label>MICYLLUS</label>
Not through either of them, Pythagoras.
</p>
<p><label>COCK</label>
Well, Homer mentions only those two.<ref n="185.2"/>
<label>MICYLLUS</label>
Let that silly poet go hang! He knows nothing
about dreams. Perhaps the beggarly dreams go
out through those gates, dreams like those he used
to see; and he couldn’t see them very plainly
at that, for he was blind! But my darling dream
<note n="185.1">The metaphor comes from the proverbial jump of Phayllus. Fifty feet of ground had been broken to form a pit for the jumpers to alight in, but Phayllus, they say, came down on the solid ground, five feet beyond the pit.</note>

came through gates of gold, and it was gold itself
and all dressed in gold and brought heaps of gold
with it.
</p>
<p><label>COCK</label>
Stop babbling of gold, most noble Midas. Really
your dream was just like Midas’ prayer, and you
appear to me to have slept yourself into whole goldmines.

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="7"><p>

<label>MICYLLUS</label>
I saw a lot of gold, Pythagoras, a lot; you can’t
think how beautiful it was, and with what brilliancy
it shone. What is it that Pindar says in praising it ?
Remind me, if you know. It is where he says water
is best and then extols gold (and well he may), right
in the beginning of the most beautiful of all his
odes.

<label>MICYLLUS</label>
That is it, by Heaven! Pindar praises gold as
though he had seen my dream. But listen, so that
you may know what it was like, wisest of cocks. I
did not eat at home, yesterday, as you know; for
Eucrates, the rich man met me in the public square
and told me to take a bath<note>No reflection on the personal habits of Micyllus is intended. As the bath was the recognized preliminary to dining-out, to mention it amounts to little more than telling him to dress for dinner.</note> and then come to dinner
at the proper hour.

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="8"><p>
<label>COCK</label>
I know that very well; I went hungry all day
until finally, late in the evening, you came back
rather tight, bringing me those five beans, not a
very bounteous repast for a cock who was once an
athlete and made a fair showing at the Olympic
games.
</p>
<p><label>MICYLLUS</label>
When I came home after dinner, I went to sleep
as soon as I had thrown you the beans, and then
“through the ambrosial night,” as Homer puts it,<ref n="189.1"/> a
truly divine dream came to me and. . .
</p>
<p><label>COCK</label>
First tell me what happened at Eucrates’, Micyllus,
how the dinner was and all about the drinkingparty afterwards. For there is nothing to hinder
you from dining all over again by making up adream
so to speak, about that dinner and chewing the cud
of your food in fancy.
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="9"><p>
<label>MICYLLUS</label>
I thought I should bore you by telling all that, but
since you want it, here goes. I never before dined
with a rich man in all my life, Pythagoras, but by
a stroke of luck I met Eucrates yesterday; after
giving him “Good-day, master,” as usual, I was for
going away again, so as not to shame him by joining
his company in my beggarly cloak. But: “Micyllus,”
said he, “I am giving a birthday party for my
daughter to-day, and have invited a great many of
my friends: but as one of them is ill, they say, and
can’t dine with us, you must take a bath and come in
his place, unless, to be sure, the man I invited says
<note n="189.1">Iliad 2, 56.</note>
189
<pb n="191"/>

that he will come himself, for just now his coming is
doubtful.” On hearing this I made obeisance to him
and went away, praying to all the gods to send an
attack of ague or pleurisy or gout to the invalid
whose substitute and diner-out and heir I had been
invited to become. I thought it an interminable
age until my bath, and kept looking all the while
to see how long the shadow was and when it would
at last be time to bathe.</p>
<p>When the time finally came, I scrubbed myself
with all speed and went off very well dressed, as I
had turned my cloak inside out so that the garment
might’ show the cleaner side.

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="10"><p>

I met at the door a
number of people, and among them, carried on the
shoulders of four bearers, the man whose place I was
to have filled, who they said was ill; and in fact he
was clearly ina bad way. At any rate he groaned
and coughed and hawked in a hollow and Giencive
way, and was all pale and flabby, a man of about
sixty. He was said to be one of those philosophers
who talk rubbish to the boys, and in fact. he had
a regular goat’s beard, excessively long. And when
Archibius, the doctor, took him to task for coming in
that condition, “Duty,” he said, “must not be
shirked, especially by a philosopher, though a
thousand illnesses stand in his way; Eucrates
would think he had been slighted by me.” “No
indeed,” ‘said I, “He will commend you if you
choose to die at home rather than to hawk and spit
your life away at his party!” But the man’s pride

<pb n="193"/>

was so great that he pretended not to have heard
the sally. In a moment Eucrates joined us after his
bath, and on seeing ‘Thesmopolis—for that was the
philosopher’s name—he said : “Professor, it was very
good of you to come to us, but you would not have
fared any the worse if you had stayed away, for
everything from first to last would have been sent
you.” With that he started to go in, conducting
Thesmopolis, who was supported by the servants too.

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="11"><p>

I was getting ready to go away, but he turned my way
and hesitated a good while, and then, as he saw that
I was very: downeast, said: “You come in too,
Micyllus, and dine with us. Tl make my son eat
with his mother in the women’s quarters so that you
may have room.” I went in, therefore, after coming
within an ace of licking my lips for nothing, like
the wolf<ref n="193.1"/>; I was ashamed, however, because I
seemed to have driven Eucrates’ boy out of the
dining-room.</p>
<p>When it was time to go to the table, first of all
they picked Thesmopolis up and put him in place,
not without some difficulty, though there were five
stout lads, I think, to do it; and they stuffed
eushions all round about him so that he could
maintain his position and hold out for a long time.
Then, as nobody else could endure to lie near him,
they took me and put me in the place below him,
making us neighbours at table. Then, Pythagoras,
we began eating a dinner of many courses and great
variety, served on gold and silver plate in profusion,
<note n="193.1">The proverb seems to be founded on the fable of the wolf and the old woman ; she threatened to throw a baby to the wolf if it did not stop crying, and the wolf waited all day for the baby, only to go home disappointed. (Aesop, 275 Halm.)</note>


<pb n="195"/>

and there were goblets of gold and handsome
waiters and musicians and clowns withal. In short,
we were delightfully entertained, except for one
thing that annoyed me beyond measure: Thesmopolis
kept bothering me and talking to me about virtue,
whatever that may be, and teaching me that two
negatives make an affirmative, and that if it is day
it is not night ; and sometimes he actually said that I
had horns.<ref n="195.1"/> By philosophizing with me incessantly
after that fashion when I had no mind for it, he
spoiled and diminished my pleasure, not allowing me
to hear the performers who were playing and singing. Well, there you have your dinner, cock.
</p>
<p><label>COCK</label>
It was not of the pleasantest, Micyllus, as your
lot was cast with that silly old man.

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="12"><p>

<label>MICYLLUS</label>
Now listen to my dream. I thought that Eucrates
himself had somehow become childless and lay dying,
and that, after sending for me and making a will in
which I was heir to everything, he lingered a while
and then died. On entering into possession of the
property, I dipped up the gold and the silver in
great bowlfuls, for there was an ever-flowing, copious
stream of it; and all the rest, too—the ‘clothing
and tables and cups and waiters—all was mine, ot
course. Then I drove out behind a pair of white
horses, holding my head high, the admiration and
the envy of all beholders; many ran before me and
rode beside me, and still more followed after me, and
I with his clothing on and my fingers covered with

<pb n="197"/>

heavy rings, fully sixteen of them, was giving orders
for a splendid feast to be prepared for the entertainment of my friends. In a moment they were there,
as is natural in a dream, and the dinner was being
served, and the drinking-bout was under way. While
I was thus engaged and was drinking healths with
each person there out of golden cups, just as the
dessert was being brought in you lifted up your
voice unseasonably, and disturbed our party, upset
the tables and caused that wealth of mine to be
scattered to the winds. Now do you think I was
unreasonable in getting angry at you, when I should
have been glad to see the dream last for three
nights ?
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="13"><p>

<label>COCK</label>
Are you such a lover of gold and of riches,
Micyllus, and is owning quantities of gold the only
thing in the world that you admire and consider
blissful ?
</p>
<p><label>MICYLLUS</label>
I am not the only ‘one to do so, Pythagoras: you
yourself, when you were Euphorbus, sallied forth to
fight the Achaeans with your curls tricked out in
gold and silver, and even in war, where it would
have been better to wear iron, you thought fit to
face danger with your hair caught up with gold.<ref n="197.1"/>
No doubt Homer said that your hair was “like the
Graces” because “it was snooded with gold and with
silver” ; for it looked far finer and lovelier, of course,
when it was interwoven with gold and shone in
unison with it. And yet as far as you are concerned,
Goldenhair, it is of little moment that you, the son
of a Panthous, honoured gold, but what of the father
<note n="197.1">Tliad 17, 52.</note>
197
<pb n="199"/>

of gods and of men, the son of Cronus and Rhea?
When he was in love with that slip ofa girl in Argos,
not having anything more attractive to change
himself into nor any other means of corrupting the
sentries of Acrisius, he turned into gold, as you, of
course, have heard, and came down through the roof
to visit his beloved. Then what is the use of my
telling you the rest of it—how many uses gold has,
and how, when people have it, it renders them
handsome and wise and strong, lending them honour
and esteem, and not infrequently it makes inconspicuous and contemptible people admired and renowned in a short time?

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="14"><p>

For instance, you know
my neighbour, of the same trade, Simon, who dined
with me not long ago when I boiled the soup for
Cronus-day and put in two slices of sausage?

<p><label>COCK</label>
Yes, I know him; the snub-nosed, short fellow
who filched the earthen bowl and went away with it
under his arm after dinner, the only bowl we had—
I myself saw him, Micyllus.

So it was he that stole it and then swore by so
many gods that he did not? But why didn’t you
cry out and tell on him then, cock, when you saw us
being plundered ?

I crowed, and that was all that I could do at the
time. But what about Simon? You seemed to be
going to say something about him.

He had a cousin who was enormously rich, named

did not touch his money? But since his death the
other day all his property is Simon’s by law, and now
he, the man with the dirty rags, the man that used
to lick the pot, takes the air pleasantly, dressed in
fine woollens and royal purple, the owner of servants
and carriages and golden cups and_ ivory-legged
tables, receiving homage from everybody and no
longer even giving a glance at me. Recently, for
example, I saw him coming toward me and said,
“Good-day, Simon’; but he replicd: “Tell that
pauper not to abbreviate my name; it is not Simon
but Simonides.”<ref n="201.1"/>1 What is more, the women are
actually in love with him now, and he flirts with
them and slights them, and when he receives some
and is gracious to them the others threaten to hang
themselves on account of his neglect. You see,
don’t you, what blessings gold is able to bestow,
when it transforms ugly people and renders them
lovely, like the girdle in poetry?<ref n="201.2"/> And you have
heard the poets say: “O gold, thou choicest
treasure,”<ref n="201.3"/> and

You can’t by any possibility find that out. But
when I became Euphorbus—for I am going back to
that subject—I fought at Troy and was killed by
Menelaus, and some time afterwards I entered into
Pythagoras. In the meanwhile I stood about and
waited without a house till Mnesarchus should build
me one.

Bactria. Tl tell you thus much, though: nothing
was out of the common then, and Ajax was not as
tall and Helen herself not as fair as people think.
As I saw her, she had a white complexion and a long
neck, to be sure, so that you might know she was
the daughter of a swan ; but as for the rest of it, she
was decidedly old, about the saine age as Hecuba;
for Theseus eloped with her in the first place and
kept her at Aphidnae, and Theseus lived in the time
of Heracles, who took Troy the first time it was
taken, in the time of our fathers,—our then fathers,
Imean. Panthous told me all this, and said that
when he was quite small he had seen Heracles.

I did not come into contact with him at all,
Micyllus, and I can’t tell you as accurately about
the Greek side. How could I, being one of the
enemy? His comrade Patroclus, however, I killed
without difficulty, running him through with my
spear.<ref n="207.1"/>
<label>MICYLLUS</label>
And then Menelaus killed you with much greater
ease! But enough of this, and now tell me the
story of Pythagoras.
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="18"><p>

<label>COCK</label>
In brief, Micyllus, I was a sophist, for I must tell
the truth, I suppose. However, I was not uneducated or unacquainted with the noblest sciences. I
<note n="207.1">The cock is drawing the long-bow; Euphorbus only wounded Patroclus, Iliad 16, 806 ff.</note>
207
<pb n="209"/>

even went to: Egypt to study with the prophets,
penetrated into their sanctuaries and learned the
books of Horus and Isis by heart, and then I sailed
away to Italy and worked upon the Greeks in that
quarter of the world to such an extent that they
thought me a god.
</p>
<p><label>MICYLLUS</label>
So I have heard, and I have also heard that you
were thought to have come to life again after dying,
and that you once showed them that your thigh was of
gold. But, look here, tell me how it occurred to you
to make a law against eating either meat or beans?
</p>
<p><label>COCK</label>
Do not press that question, Micyllus.
</p>
<p><label>MICYLLUS</label>
Why, cock ?
Cock
Because I am ashamed to tell you the truth of it.
</p>
<p><label>MICYLLUS</label>
But you oughtn’t to hesitate to tell a housemate
and a friend—for I cannot call myself your master
any longer.
</p>
<p><label>COCK</label>
It was nothing sensible or wise, but I perceived
that if I made laws that were ordinary and just
like those of the run of legislators I should not
induce men to wonder at me, whereas the more I departed from precedent, the more of a figure I should
cut, I thought, in their eyes. Therefore I preferred
to introduce innovations, keeping the reason for
them secret so that one man might guess one thing


<pb n="211"/>

and one another, and all be perplexed, as they are in
the case of oracles that are obscure. Look here, you
are laughing at me, now.
</p>
<p><label>MICYLLUS</label>
Not so much at you as at the people of Croton
and Metapontum and Tarentum and all the rest who
followed you dumbly and worshipped the footprints
that you left in walking.

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="19"><p>

But after you put off the
part of Pythagoras what other did you assume ?
</p>
<p><label>COCK</label>
Aspasia, the courtesan from Miletus.
</p>
<p><label>MICYLLUS</label>
Whew, what a yarn! So Pythagoras became a
woman on top of everything else, and there was
once atime when you laid eggs, most distinguished
of cocks; when you lived with Pericles in the
capacity of Aspasia and had children by him and
carded wool and spun yarn and made the most of
your sex in courtesan style?
</p>
<p><label>COCK</label>
Yes, I did all that, and I am not the only one:
both Tiresias and Caeneus the son of Elatus preecded
me, so that all your jokes at my expense will be at
their expense too.<ref n="211.1"/>
<label>MICYLLUS</label>
How about it? Which life did you find the
pleasanter, when you were a man or when Pericles
dallied with you ?

<note n="211.1">Tiresias struck a pair of mating serpents with his staff, and turned into a woman ; seven years later he once more saw them and struck them, becoming a man again (Ovid, Melam. 3, 316 ff.). Poseidon turned Caenis into a man at her own request after he had wronged her (Metam. 12, 189 ff.).</note>

211
<pb n="213"/>

<label>COCK</label>
Just see what a question you have asked there!
Even Tiresias paid dearly for answering it !<ref n="213.1"/>
<label>MICYLLUS</label>
Whether you tell me or not, Euripides has settled
the business well enough, for he says that he would
sooner stand in line of battle thrice over than bear a
single child.<ref n="213.2"/>
<label>COCK</label>
I'll remind you of that before long, Micyllus, when
you are in child-bed; for you too will be a woman
again and again in your long cycle of existences.
</p>
<p><label>MICYLLUS</label>
Hang you, cock, do you think everybody hails from
Miletus or Samos? They say that while you were
Pythagoras and young and handsome you often
played Aspasia to the tyrant. But what man or
woman did you become after Aspasia ?
</p>
<p><label>COCK</label>
The Cynic Crates.
</p>
<p><label>MICYLLUS</label>
Twin brethren! what ups and downs! First a
courtesan, then a philosopher !
</p>
<p><label>COCK</label>
Then a king, then a poor man, and soon a satrap ;
then a horse, a jackdaw, a frog, and a thousand things
besides ; it would take too long to enumerate them
all. But of late I have often been a cock, for I liked
that sort of life; and after belonging to many men,
<note n="213.1">Zeus had said that Hera’s sex enjoyed more pleasure than his own. Hera denied it; Tiresias was called in as umpire and held with Zeus, whereupon Hera struck him blind (Metam. l. c.).</note>

<pb n="215"/>

both rich and poor, at length I am now living with
you, laughing at you every day for bewailing and
lamenting over your poverty and for admiring the
rich through ignorance of the troubles that are
theirs. Indeed, if you knew the cares they have,
you would laugh at yourself for thinking at_ first
that wealth was a source of extraordinary happiness.
</p>
<p><label>MICYLLUS</label>
Well then, Pythagoras—but tell me what you
like best to be called, so that I may not muddle up
our conversation by calling you different names.
</p>
<p><label>COCK</label>
It will make no difference whether you call me
Euphorbus or Pythagoras, Aspasia or Crates; I am
all of them. But you had better call me what you
now see me to be, a cock, so as not to slight a bird
that, although held in low esteem, has in itself so
many souls.
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="20"><p>

<label>MICYLLUS</label>
Well then, cock, as you have tried almost every
existence and know everything, please tell me
clearly about the life of the rich and the life of the
poor, each by itself, so that I may learn if you are
telling the truth when you declare that I am happier
than the rich.
</p>
<p><label>COCK</label>
Well now, look at it this way, Micyllus. As for you,
you are little concerned about war if you hear that
the enemy is approaching, and you do not worry for
fear they may lay your farm waste in a raid or
215
<pb n="217"/>

trample down your garden or cut down your grapevines; when you hear the trumpet, at most you
simply consider yourself and where you are to turn in
order to save yourself and escape the danger. The
rich, however, not only fear for themselves but are
distressed when they look from the walls and see all
that they own in the country harried and plundered.
Moreover if it is necessary to pay a special tax, they
alone are summoned to do so, and if it is necessary
to take the field, they risk their lives in the van as
commanders of horse or foot, whereas you, with but
a wicker shield, have little to carry and nothing to
impede your flight, and are ready to celebrate the
victory when the general offers sacrifice after winning
the battle.

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="21"><p>

In time of peace, on the other hand, being one of
the voters, you go to the assembly and lord it over
the rich while they quake and cringe and seck your
good will with presents. Besides, it is they who
toil that you may have baths and shows and everything else to your heart’s content, while you investigate and scrutinize them harshly like a master,
sometimes without even letting them say a word for
themselves; and if you choose you shower them
generously with stones or confiscate their properties.
And_ you do not dread an informer, nor yet a robber
who might steal your gold by climbing over the
coping or digging through the wall; and you are
not bothered with casting up accounts or collecting
debts or squabbling with your confounded agents,
and thus dividing your attention among so many
worries. No, after you have finished a sandal and
received your pay of seven obols, you get up from
your bench toward evening, take a bath if you choose,
217
<pb n="219"/>

buy yourself a bloater or sprats or a bunch of onions,
and have a good time, singing a great deal and
philosophizing with that good soul, Poverty.

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="22"><p>

So in consequence of all this you are sound
and strong in body and can stand the cold, for
your hardships have trained you fine and made you
no mean fighter against adverse conditions that scem
to the rest of the world irresistible. No chance
that one of their severe illnesses will come near
you: on the contrary, if ever you get a light fever,
after humouring it a little while you jump out
of bed at once, shaking off your discomfort, and the
fever takes flight immediately on seeing that you
drink cold water and have no use for doctors’ visits.
But the rich, unhappy that they are—what ills are
they not subject to through intemperance? Gout
and consumption and pneumonia and dropsy are the
consequences of those splendid dinners.</p>

<p>In brief, some of them who like Icarus fly high
and draw near the sun without knowing that their
wings are fitted on with wax, now and then make
a great splash by falling head-first into the sea, while
of those who, copying Daedalus, have not let their
ambitions soar high in the air but have kept them
close to earth so that the wax is occasionally wet
with spray, the most part reach their journey’s end
in safety.
</p>
<p><label>MICYLLUS</label>
You mean temperate and sensible people.
</p>
<p><label>COCK</label>
But as for the others, Micyllus, you can see how
sadly they come to grief when a Croesus with his
219
<pb n="221"/>

wings clipped makes sport for the Persians by
mounting the pyre, or a Dionysius, expelled from
his tyrant’s throne, turns up in Corinth as a schoolmaster, teaching children their a, b—ab, after holding sway so widely.

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="23"><p>

<label>MICYLLUS</label>
Tell me, cock, when you were king—for you say
you were once on a time—how did you find that
life? You were completely happy, I suppose, as
you had what is surely the acme of all blessings.
</p>
<p><label>COCK</label>
Don’t even remind me of it, Micyllus, so utterly
wretched was I then; for although in all things
external I seemed to be completely happy, as you
say, I had a thousand vexations within.
</p>
<p><label>MICYLLUS</label>
What were they? What you say is strange and
not quite credible.
</p>
<p><label>COCK</label>
I ruled over a great country, Micyllus, one that
roduced everything and was among the most noteworthy for the number of its people and the beauty
of its cities, one that was traversed by navigable
rivers and had a sea-coast with good harbours ; and
I had a great army, trained cavalry, a large bodyguard, triremes, untold riches, a great quantity of
gold plate and all the rest of the paraphernalia of
rule enormously exaggerated, so that when I went
out the people made obeisance and thought they
beheld a god inthe flesh, and they ran up one after
221
<pb n="223"/>

another to look at me, while some even went up to
the house-tops, thinking it a great thing to have had
a good look at my horses, my mantle, my diadem,
and my attendants before and behind me. But I
myself, knowing how many vexations and torments
I had, pardoned them, to be sure, for their folly, but
pitied myself for being no better than the great
colossi that Phidias or Myron or Praxiteles made,
each of which outwardly is a beautiful Poseidon or
a Zeus, made of ivory and gold, with a thunderbolt
ora flash of lightning or a trident in his right hand ;
but if you stoop down and look inside, you will see
bars and props and nails driven clear through, and
beams and wedges and pitch and clay and a quantity
of such ugly stuff housing within, not to mention
numbers of mice and rats that keep their court in
them sometimes. That is what monarchy is like.

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="24"><p>

<label>MICYLLUS</label>
You haven’t yet told me what the clay and the
props and bars are in monarchy, nor what that
“quantity of ugly stuff” is. [ll grant you, to drive
out as the ruler of so many people amid admiration
and homage is wonderfully like your comparison of
the colossus, for it savours of divinity. But tell me
about the inside of the colossus now.
</p>
<p><label>COCK</label>
What shall I tell you first, Micyllus? The terrors,
the frights, the suspicions, the hatred of your
223
<pb n="225"/>

associates, the plots, and as a result of all this the
seanty sleep, and that not sound, the dreams full
of tumult, the intricate plans and the perpetual
expectations of something bad? Or shall I tell you
of the press of business, negotiations, lawsuits,
campaigns, orders, countersigns, and calculations ?
These things prevent a ruler from enjoying any
pleasure even in his sleep; he alone must think
about everything and have a thousand worries.
Even in the case of Agamemnon, son of Atreus,

<cit><quote><l>Sweet sleep came to him not as he weighed in his
mind many projects,</l></quote>
<bibl>Iliad10, 3-4</bibl></cit>

though all the Achaeans were snoring ! The king
of Lydia<ref n="225.1"/> is worried because his son is mute, the
king of Persia<ref n="225.2"/> because Clearchus is enlisting troops
for Cyrus, another<ref n="225.3"/> because Dion is holding whispered conversations with a few Syracusans, another<ref n="225.4"/>
because Parmenio is praised, Perdiccas because of
Ptolemy, and Ptolemy because of Seleucus. And
there are other grounds for worry too, when your
favourite will have nothing to do with you except by
constraint, when your mistress fancies someone else,
when one or another is said to be on the point of
revolting, and when two or three of your guardsmen
are whispering to one another. What is more, you
must be particularly suspicious of your dearest
friends and always be expecting some harm to come
from them. For example, I was poisoned by my son,
he himself by his favourite, and the latter no doubt
met some other death of a similar sort.
</p>
<p><label>MICYLLUS</label>

me, at least, it is far safer to bend over and cobble
shoes than to drink out of a golden cup when
the health that is pledged you is qualified with
hemlock or aconite. The only risk I run is that
if my knife should slip sideways and fail to cut
straight, I might draw a little blood by cutting
my fingers; but they, as you say, do their feasting
at the peril of their lives and live amid a thousand
ills beside. Then when they fall they make no
better figure than the actors that you often see,
who for a time pretend to be a Cecrops or a Sisyphus
or a Telephus, with diadems and ivory-hilted swords
and waving hair and gold-embroidered tunics ; but if
(as often happens) one of them misses his footing
and falls down in the middle of the stage, it
naturally makes fun for the audience when the mask
gets broken to pieces, diadem and all, and the actor’s
own face is covered with blood, and his legs are
bared high, so as to show that his inner garments
are miserable rags and that the buskins with which
he is shod are shapeless and do not fit his foot. Do
you see how you have already taught me to make
comparisons, friend cock? Well, as for absolute
power, it proves to be something of that sort. But
when you became a horse or a dog or a fish or a frog,
how did you find that existence?

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="25"><p>


<label>COCK</label>
That is a long story you are starting, and we have
not time for it just now. But to give the upshot of
it, there is no existence that did not seem to me more
care-free than that of man, since the others are con-
‘ formed to natural desires and needs alone ; you will
not see among them a horse bailiff or a frog informer
227
<pb n="229"/>

or a jackdaw sophist or a mosquito chef or a libertine
cock or any of the other modes of life that you men
follow.

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="26"><p>

<label>MICYLLUS</label>
No doubt that is true, cock. But as to myself, I
am not ashamed to tell you how I feel. I am not
yet able to unlearn the desire of becoming rich that
[have had since my boyhood. My dream, too, still
stands before my eyes displaying its gold; and
above all I am choking with envy of that confounded
Simon, who is revelling in so many blessings.
</p>
<p><label>COCK</label>
I will cure you, Micyllus. As it is still night, get
up and follow me; I will take you to visit Simon
and to the house of the other rich men, so that you
may see what their establishments are like.
</p>
<p><label>MICYLLUS</label>
How can you do it when their doors are locked?
You aren't going to make me be a burglar ?
</p>
<p><label>COCK</label>
Not by any means. But Hermes, to whom IT am
consecrated, gave me this privilege, that if my
longest tail feather, the one that is so pliant that it
curls—
</p>
<p><label>MICYLLUS</label>
You have two like that.
</p>
<p><label>COCK</label>
It is the one on the right, and if I permit any man
to pull it out and keep it, that man, as long as I
choose, can open every door and see everything
without being seen himself.

<label>MICYLLUS</label>
I didn’t realize, cock, that you yourself were a
conjurer. Well, if you only let me have it, you shall
see all Simon’s possessions brought over here in a
jiffy: Pl slip in and bring them over, and he will
once more eat his leather as he stretches it.<ref n="231.1"/>
<label>COCK</label>
That is impossible, for Hermes ordered me, if the
man who had the feather did anything of that sort,
to uplift my voice and expose him.
</p>
<p><label>MICYLLUS</label>
It is hard to believe what you say, that Hermes,
himself a thief, begrudges others the same privilege.
But let’s be off just the same ; I'll keep my hands off
the gold if I can.
</p>
<p><label>COCK</label>
First pluck the feather out, Micyllus . . . What's
this? You have pulled them both out !
</p>
<p><label>MICYLLUS</label>
It is safer to do so, cock, and it will spoil your
beauty less, preventing you from being crippled on
one side of your tail.

All right. Shall we visit Simon first, or one of
the other rich men?

No: Simon, who wants to have a name of four
syllables instead of two, now that he is rich. Here
we are at the door already. What shall I do next?

Well, then, that seventy talents is quite safely
buried under the bed and no one else knows of it;
but as for the sixteen, I think Sosylus the groom saw
me hiding them under the manger. At any rate he
is all for hanging about the stable, though he is not
particularly attentive to business otherwise or fond
of work. I have probably been robbed of much
more than that, or else where did Tibius get the
money for the big slice of salt fish they said he
treated himself to yesterday or the earring they said
he bought for his wife at a cost of five whole
drachmas ?_ It’s my money these fellows are squandering, worse luck! But my cups are not stored in a
safe place, either, and there are so many! I’m afraid
someone may burrow under the wall and steal them:

allright. Ill dig up my gold and count it again, for
fear I made a mistake yesterday. There, now, somebody made a noise: he’s after me, of course. I am

Well, Hephaestus, here is the Caucasus, where
this poor Titan will have to be nailed up. Now then
let us look about for a suitable rock, if there is a place
anywhere that has no snow on it, so that the irons
may be riveted in more firmly and he may be in full
sight of everybody as he hangs there.
</p>
<p><label>HEPHAESTUS</label>
Yes, let’s look about, Hermes : we mustn't crucify
him low and close to the ground for fear that men,
his own handiwork, may come to his aid, nor yet on
the summit, either, for he would be out of sight
from below. Suppose we crucify him half way up,
somewhere hereabouts over the ravine, with his
hands outstretched from this rock to that one ?
</p>
<p><label>HERMES</label>
Right you are; the cliffs are sheer and inaccessible
on every side, and overhang slightly, and the rock
has only this narrow foothold, so that one can barely
stand on tip toe ; in short, it will make a very handy
cross. Well, Prometheus, don’t hang back: climb
up and let yourself be riveted to the mountain.

we disobey the order! Don’t you suppose the
Caucasus has room enough to hold two more pegged
up? Come, hold out your right hand. Secure
it, Hephaestus, and nail it up, and bring your
hammer down with a will. Give me the other hand
too. Let that be well secured also. That’s good.

What a fate I suffer, luckless that I am, when I
have done no harm.
</p>
<p><label>HERMES</label>
No harm, Prometheus? In the first place you
undertook to serve out our meat and did it so unfairly and trickily that you abstracted all the best
of it for yourself and cheated Zeus by wrapping
“bones in glistening fat”: for I remember that
Hesiod says so.<ref n="245.1"/> Then you made human beings,
thoroughly unprincipled creatures, particularly the
women; and to top all, you stole fire, the most
valued possession of the gods, and actually gave that
to men. When you have done so much harm, do
you say that you have been put in irons without
having done any wrong?

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="4"><p>
<label>PROMETHEUS</label>
Hermes, you seem to be “blaming a man who is
blameless,” to speak with the poet,<ref n="247.1"/> for you reproach
me with things for which I should have sentenced
myself to maintenance in the Prytaneum if justice
were being done.<ref n="247.2"/> At any rate, if you have time, I
should be glad to stand trial on the charges, so that
I might prove that Zeus has passed an unjust sentence on me. As you are ready-tongued and litigious,
suppose you plead in his behalf that he was just in
his decision that I be crucified near the Caspian gates
here in the Caucasus, a most piteous spectacle for all
the Scythians.
</p>
<p><label>HERMES</label>
Your appeal, Prometheus, will be tardy and of no
avail, but say your say just the same; for in any case
we must remain here until the eagle flies down to
attend to your liver. This interval of leisure may as
well be employed in listening to a sophistic speech,
as you are a very clever scoundrel at speech-making.

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="5"><p>

<label>PROMETHEUS</label>
Speak first, then, Hermes, and see that you accuse
me as eloquently as you can and that you don’t
neglect any of your father’s claims. Hephaestus, I
make you judge.
</p>
<p><label>HEPHAESTUS</label>
No, by Heaven; you will find me an accuser
<note n="247.1">[liad 13, 775.</note>
<note n="247.2">After Socrates has been found guilty, his accusers proposed that he be condemned to death. He made a counterproposition that he be allowed to dine at the Prytaneum for the rest of his life, on the ground that he deserved this privilege better and needed it more than did the Olympic chainpions to whom it was accorded.</note>
247
<pb n="249"/>

instead of a judge, I promise you, for you abstracted
my fire and left my forge cold.
</p>
<p><label>PROMETHEUS</label>
Well, then, divide the accusation ; you can accuse
me of the theft now, and then Hermes will
criticize the serving of the meat and the making of
men. You both belong to trades-unions and are
likely to be good at speaking.
</p>
<p><label>HEPHAESTUS</label>
Hermes shall speak for me too, for I am no hand
at court specches but stick by my forge for the most
part, while he is an orator and has taken uncommon
interest in such matters.
</p>
<p><label>PROMETHEUS</label>
I should never have thought that Hermes would
care to speak about the theft or to reproach me
with anything like that, when I follow his own trade !
However, if you agree to this, son of Maea, it is high
time you were getting on with your accusation.
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="6"><p>

<label>HERMES</label>
Just as if long speeches and adequate preparation
were necessary, Prometheus, and it were not enough
simply to summarize your wrong-doings and say that
when you were commissioned to divide the meat you
tried to keep the best for yourself “and cheat the
king, and that you made men when you should not,
and that you stole fire from us and took it to them!
You do not seem to realize, my excellent friend, that
you have found Zeus very humane in view of such
actions. Now if you deny that you have committed
them, I shall have to have it out with you and make
a long speech and try my best to bring out the truth;
but if you admit that you served the meat in that
249
<pb n="251"/>

way and made the innovations in regard to men and
stole fire, my accusation is sufficient and I don’t
care to say any more; to do so would be a mere
waste of words.

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="7"><p>

<label>PROMETHEUS</label>
Perhaps what you have said is also a waste of
words ; we shall see a little later! But as you say
your accusation is sufficient, I shall try as best I can
to dissipate the charges. And first let me tell you
about the meat. By Heaven, even now as I speak
of it I blush for Zeus, if he is so mean and fault-finding as to send a prehistoric god like me to be
crucified just because he found a small bone in his
portion, without remembering how we fought side
by side or thinking how slight the ground for his
anger is and how. childish it is to “be angry and
enraged unless he gets the lion’s share himself.

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="8"><p>

Deceptions of that sort, Hermes, occurring at table,
should not be remembered, but if a mistake is made
among people who are having a good time, it should
be considered a practical joke and one’s anger should
be left behind there in the dining room. To store
up one’s hatred against the morrow, to hold spite
and to cherish a stale grudge—come, it is not seemly
for gods and in any case not kingly. Anyhow, if
dinners are deprived of these attractions, of trickery,
jokes, mockery and ridicule, all that is left is drunkenness, repletion and silence; gloomy, joyless things,
all of them, not in the least appropriate to a dinner.
So I should not have thought that Zeus would even
251
<pb n="253"/>

remember the affair until the next day, to say nothing
of taking on so about it and considering he had
been horribly treated if someone in serving meat
played a joke to see if the chooser could tell which
was the better portion.

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="9"><p>

Suppose, however, Hermes, that it was more
serious—that instead of giving Zeus the smaller
portion I had abstracted the whole of it—what then?
Just because of that ought he to have mingled earth
with heaven, as the saying goes, and ought he to
conjure up irons and crosses and a whole Caucasus
and send down eagles and pick out my liver?
Doesn’t all this accuse the angered man himself of
great pettiness and meanness of disposition and
readiness to get angry? What would he have done
in ease he had been choused out of a whole ox, if
he wreaks such mighty deeds about a little meat ?
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="10"><p>
How much more good-natured human beings are
about such things! One would expect them to be
more quick to wrath than the gods, but in spite of
that there is not one among them who would
propose to crucify his cook if “he dipped his finger
into the broth while the meat was boiling and
licked off a little, or if he pulled off a bit of the
roast and gobbled it up. No, they pardon them.
To be sure, if they are extremely angry, they give
them a slap or hit them over the head ; but among
them nobody was ever crucified on so trivial a
ground.
So much for the meat—an unseemly plea for me to
make, but a far more unseemly accusation for him to
bring ;

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="11"><p>
and now it is time to speak of my handiwork
and the fact that I made men. This embodies a
253
<pb n="255"/>

twofold accusation, Hermes, and I don’t know which
charge you bring against me—that men should not
have been created at all but would better have been
left alone as mere clay, or that they should have
been made, as far as that goes, but fashioned after
some other pattern than this. However, I shall
speak to both charges. In the first place I shall try
to show that it has done the gods no harm to bring
men into the world, and then that this is actually
advantageous, far better for them than if the earth
had happened to remain deserted and unpeopled.

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="12"><p>

There existed, then, in time gone by (for if I
begin there it will be easier to see whether I have
done any wrong in my alterations and innovations
with regard to men) there existed, as I say, only the
divine, the heavenly race. The earth was a rude
and ugly thing all shaggy with woods, and wild
woods at that, and there were no divine altars or
temples—how could there be ?—or images or anything else of the sort, though they are now to be
seen in great numbers everywhere, honoured with
every form of observance. But as I am always
planning something for the common good and considering how the condition of the gods may be
improved and everything else may increase in order
and in beauty, it occurred to me that it would be a
good idea to take a little bit of clay and create a
few living things, making them like us in appearance; for I thought that divinity was not quite
complete in the absence of its counterpart, comparison with which would show divinity to be the
255
<pb n="257"/>

happier state. This should be mortal, I thought,
but highly inventive and intelligent and able to
appreciate what was better.

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="13"><p>

And then, “water and
earth intermingling,” in the words of the poet,<ref n="257.1"/> and
kneading them, I moulded men, inviting Athena,
moreover, to give me a hand in the task. Therein
lies the great wrong I have done the gods, and you
see what the penalty is for making creatures out of
mud and imparting motion to that which was
formerly motionless. From that time on, it would
seem, the gods are less of gods because on earth a
few mortal creatures have come into being! Indeed,
Zeus is actually as angry as though the gods were
losing caste through the creation of men. Surely he
doesn’t’ fear that they will plot an insurrection
against him and make war on the gods as the Giants
did ?</p>
<p>No, Hermes, that you gods have suffered no wrong
through me and my works is self-evident; come,
show me even one wrong of the smallest sort, and I
will hold my tongue and own that I have had the
treatment that I deserved at your hahds.

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="14"><p>
On the
contrary, that my creation has been actually of
service to the gods you will learn if you notice that
the whole earth is no longer barren and unbeautiful
but adorned with cities and tilled lands and cultivated
plants, that the sea is sailed and the islands are
inhabited, and that everywhere there are altars and
sacrifices, temples and festivals,

<cit><quote><l>and full of God are all the streets</l>
<l>And all the marts of men.</l></quote>
<bibl>Aratus, Phaenomena2-3.</bibl></cit>


<note n="257.1">Hesiod, Works and Days 61.</note>


<pb n="259"/>

If I had made men to keep just for myself, I should
be selfish, no doubt ; but as the case stands I have
contributed them to the general fund for your
benefit. In fact, there are temples to Zeus, to Apollo,
to Hera and to you, Hermes, in sight everywhere,
but nowhere any to Prometheus. You see how I
look out for my own interests, but betray and injure
those of the community !

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="15"><p>

Moreover, Hermes, please consider this point too—
do you think that any choice thing unattested,
something that you get or make, for instance, which
nobody is going to see or to praise, will give quite as
much joy and pleasure to its owner? Why did I
ask that question? Because if men had not been
created, it would follow that the beauty of the
universe would be unattested and it would be our
lot to possess wealth, so to speak, which no one else
would admire and we ourselves would not prize so
highly ; for we should have nothing else to compare
it with, and we should not realise how happy we
were if we did not see others who did not have what
we have. What is great, you know, can only seem
great if it is gauged by something small. You should
have honoured me for that stroke of policy, but you
have crucified me and have given me this return for
my plan.

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="16"><p>

But there are rascals, you say, among them, and
they commit adultery and make war and mar ry their
sisters and plot against their fathers. Why, are
there not plenty of them among us? Yet, of course,
fone could not on this account blame Heaven and
Earth for creating us. Again, you may perhaps say
that we have to undergo a great deal of annoyance
in taking care of them. Well, then, on that principle
259
<pb n="261"/>

the herdsman ought to be vexed over having his herd
because he has to take care of it. But this toilsome
task is also sweet, and, in general, business is not devoid of pleasure, for it affords occupation. Why, what
should we do if we had not them to provide for?
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="17"><p>
Be
idle and drink our nectar and eat our ambrosia without doing anything! But what sticks in my throat
most is that although you censure me for making
men “and particularly the women,” you fall in love
with them just the same, and are always going down
below, transformed now into bulls, now into satyrs
and swans, and you deign to beget gods upon
them!</p>


<p>
Perhaps, however, you will say that men should
have been made, but in some other form and not like
us. What better model could I have put before
myself than this, which I knew to be beautiful in
every way? Should I have made my creatures
unintelligent and bestial and savage? Why, how
could they have sacrificed to gods or bestowed all
the other honours upon you if they were not as
they are? You gods do not hang back when they
bring you the hecatombs, even if you have to go to
the river of Ocean,
<cit><quote><l>to the Ethiopians guileless,</l></quote>
<bibl>Ilad1, 423.</bibl></cit>

yet
you have crucified him who procured you your
honours and your sacrifices.
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="18"><p>

So much for men; and now, if you wish, I shall
pass to fire and that reprehensible theft! In the
name of the gods answer me this question without
any hesitation; have we lost any fire since men
have had it too? You can’t say that we have.
The nature of that possession is such, I suppose,
that it is not diminished if anyone else takes some


<pb n="263"/>

of it, for it does not go out when a light is procured
from it. But surely it is downright stinginess to
prevent things from being shared with those who
need them when it does you no harm to share them.
Inasmuch as you are gods, you ought to be kindly
and
<cit><quote><l>bestowers of blessings</l></quote>
<bibl>Od, 8, 325.</bibl></cit>
and to stand aloof
from all stinginess. In this case even if I had filched
all your fire and taken it down to earth without
leaving a bit of it behind, I should not be guilty
of any great wrong-doing against you, for you yourselves have no need of it, as you do not get cold and
do not cook your ambrosia and do not require artificial light.

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="19"><p>

On the other hand, men are obliged to
use fire, not only for other purposes but above all for
the sacrifices, in order that they may be able “to fill
the ways with savour” and to burn incense and consume meat on the altars. Indeed, I notice that you
all take particular pleasure in the smoke and think it
the most delightful of banquets when the savour
comes up to heaven

<cit><quote><l>curling about the smoke.</l></quote>
<bibl>Iliad1, 317.</bibl></cit>


This criticism, therefore, is directly opposed to your
own desire. I wonder, moreover, that you haven’t
prevented the sun from shining on men, for he is fire
too, and of a far more divine and ardent sort. Do
you find fault with him for dissipating your property?
I have said my say. Now then, Hermes and
Hephaestus, if you think I have said anything wrong
take me to task and confute me, and I will plead in
reply.

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="5"><p>
<label>MENIPPUS</label>
Listen then, for a friend left in the lurch with his
mouth open would be anything but a pretty spectacle,
especially if he were hanging by the ears, as you say
you are.
As soon as I began to find, in the course of my
investigation of life, that all objects of human
endeavour are ridiculous and trivial and insecure
(wealth, I mean, and office and sovereign power),
contemning those things and assuming that the
effort to get them was an obstacle to getting things
truly worth effort, I undertook to lift my eyes and
contemplate the universe. In so doing I was caused
great perplexity, first of all by what the philosophers
call the Cosmos, for I could not discover how it came
into being or who made it, or its source or purpose.
Then in examining it part by part I was compelled
to rack my brains still more, for I saw the stars
scattered hap-hazard about the sky, and I wanted to
know what the sun itself could be. Above all, the
peculiarities of the moon seemed to me extraordinary
and completely paradoxical, and I conjectured that
her multiplicity of shapes had some hidden reason.
More than that, lightning flashing and thunder
crashing and rain or snow or hail driving down were
all hard to interpret and impossible to reason out.

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="6"><p>

Being in that state of mind, I thought it best to
learn about all these points from the philosophers,
for I supposed that they surely would be able to tell
the whole truth.” So I picked out the best of them,
as far as I could judge from their dourness of visage,
275
<pb n="277"/>

paleness of complexion and length of beard; and as
the gentlemen at once struck me as being extremely
tall talkers and high thinkers, I put myself i in their
hands, paying down part of a good round sum on
the spot and contracting to pay the balance later,
on completion of my course in philosophy; and
then I expected to be taught how to hold forth
on the Heavens and to learn the system of the
universe. But they were so far from ridding me of
my old-time ignorance that they plunged me forthwith into even greater perplexities by flooding me
every day with first causes, final causes, atoms, voids,
elements, concepts, and all that sort of thing. But
the hardest part of it all, in my opinion at least, was
that although no one of them agreed with anyone
else in anything he said, but all their statements
were contradictory and inconsistent, they nevertheless expected to persuade me and each tried to win
me over to his own doctrine.
</p>
<p><label>FRIEND</label>
Extraordinary that learned men quarrelled with
each other about their doctrines and did not hold
the same views about the same things !

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="7"><p>

<label>MENIPPUS</label>
Indeed, my friend, it will make you laugh to hear
about the way they bragged and worked wonders
in their talk! Why, in the first place, they-stood
on the ground and were not a bit better than the
rest of us who walk the earth; in fact, they were
not even sharper sighted than their neighbours, but
some of them were actually purblind through age or
idleness. In spite of that, however, they claimed to
discern the boundaries of Heaven, they measured
277
<pb n="279"/>

the sun, they visited the spheres beyond the moon,
and you would have thought they had fallen from
the stars from the way they told about their
magnitudes and presumed to say just how many
cubits it is in distance from the sun to the moon,
often, perhaps, without even knowing how many
furlongs it is from Megara to Athens. And not only
did they measure the height of the air and the depth
of the sea and the circumference of the earth, but by
the description of circles and the construction of
triangles on squares and of imultiple spheres they
actually measured out the cubic content of the
Heavens.<ref n="279.1"/>

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="8"><p>

Moreover, was it not silly and completely absurd
that when they were talking about things so uncertain they did not make a single assertion
hypothetically but were vehement in their insistence
and gave the rest no chance to outdo them in
exaggeration; all but swearing that the sun is a mass
of molten metal, that the moon is inhabited, and
that the stars drink water, the sun drawing up the
moisture from the sea with a rope and bucket, as it
were, and distributing the beverage to all of them
in order?

As for the contradictory nature of their theories,
that is easy to appreciate. Just see for yourself, in
Heaven’s name, whether their doctrines are akin and
not widely divergent. First of all, there is their
difference of opinion about the universe. Some
<note n="279.1">I know of nothing that illustrates Lucian’s meaning better than the Psemmites, a treatise by Archimedes, which, however, is not exactly an attempt to measure the cubic capacity of the universe, but a demonstration that it is possible to express arithmetically a sum greater than the number of grains of sand in a sphere as large as the universe.</note>

<pb n="281"/>

think it is without beginning and without end, but
others have even ventured to tell who made it and
how it was constructed; and these latter surprised
me most, for they made some god or other the
creator of the universe, but did not tell where he
came from or where he stood when he created it all;
and yet it is impossible to conceive of time and
space before the genesis of the universe.
</p>
<p><label>FRIEND</label>
They are very presumptuous charlatans by what
you say, Menippus.
</p>
<p><label>MENIPPUS</label>
But my dear man, what if I should tell you all they
said about “ideas” and incorporeal entities, or their
theories about the finite and the infinite? On the
latter point also they had a childish dispute, some
of them setting a limit to the universe and others
considering it to be unlimited; nay more, they asserted that there are many worlds and censured
those who talked as if there were but one. Another,
not a man of peace, opined that war was the father
of the universe.<ref n="281.1"/>

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="10"><p>

As for the gods, why speak of them at all, seeing
that to some a number was god, while others swore
by geese and dogs and plane-trees?<ref n="281.2"/> Moreover,
some banished all the rest of the gods and assigned
the governance of the universe to one only, so that
it made me a little disgusted to hear that gods were
so scarce. Others, however, lavishly declared them

to be many and drew a distinction between them,
calling one a first god and ascribing to others second
and third rank in divinity. Furthermore, some
thought that the godhead was without form and
substance, while others defined it as body. Then
too they did not all think that the gods exercise
providence in our affairs; there were some who
relieved them of every bit of responsibility as we are
accustomed to relieve old men of public duties;
indeed, the part that they give them to play is just
like that of supers in comedy. A few went beyond
all this and did not even believe that there were any
gods at all, but left the world to wag on unruled and
ungoverned.

When I heard all this, the result was that I did not
venture to disbelieve “high-thundering” gentlemen
with goodly beards, and yet did not know where to
turn in order to find a point of doctrine that was unassailable and not in any way subject to refutation
by someone else. So I went through just what
Homer speaks of; again and again I was fain to
believe one of them,

<cit><quote><l>“but other counsel drew me

<bibl>Od. 9, 302.</bibl></cit>


At my wit’s end in view of all this, I despaired of
hearing any truth about these matters on earth and
thought that the only way out of my whole dilemma
would be to get wings somehow and go up to
Heaven. The wish was father to the thought, of
course, but the story-teller Aesop had something to
do with it also, for he makes Heaven accessible to
eagles and beetles and now and then even to camels.

283
<pb n="285"/>

Well, that I myself could ever grow wings was not in
any way possible, I thought; butif L put on the wings
of a vulture or an eagle (for no others would be
large enough to uphold the weight of a man’s body),
perhaps my attempt would succeed. So catching my
birds, I carefully cut of the right wing of the eagle
and the left wing of the vulture, tied them tightly
together, fitted them to my shoulders with stout
straps and made grips for my hands at the ends of
the primary feathers. Then I first tried myself by
jumping up and down, working my arms and doing
as geese do—lifting myself along the ground and
running on tiptoe as I flew. When the thing began
to work well for me, I went in for the experiment
with greater boldness.

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="12"><p>

Going up to the acropolis, I
let myself drop down the cliff right into the theatre.
Since I flew down without mischance, I began to
aspire high and used to take wing from Parnes or
Hymettus, flying to Geraneia and from there up to
Acrocorinthus and then over Pholoe and Erymanthus
clear to Taygetus.
Now that I had thoroughly practised my experiment and had become an adept and a lofty soarer,
I no longer had fledgling aspirations but ascended
Olympus, provisioned myself as lightly as I could
and this time made straight for Heaven. At first
I was dizzied by the height, but afterwards I stood
even that without discomfort. But when I had
left the clouds far below and had got close to
the moon, I felt myself getting tired, especially in
285
<pb n="287"/>

the left wing, the vulture’s. Flying up, therefore,
and perching on the moon, I rested myself, looking
down on the earth from on high and like Homer’s
Zeus,<ref n="287.1"/> now observing the land of the horse-loving
Thracians, now the land of the Mysians, and
presently, if I liked, Greece, Persia and India; and
from all this I got my fill of kaleidoscopic pleasure.
</p>
<p><label>FRIEND</label>
Then do tell me about it, Menippus, so that I
may not miss a single detail of the trip, but may even
know whatever you may have found out incidentally.
I assure you, I am looking forward to hearing a good
deal about the shape of the earth and about
everything upon it as it looked to you, viewing it all
from above.
</p>
<p><label>MENIPPUS</label>
You are right in your assumption, my friend, so
mount up to the moon in fancy as best you can and
share my trip and my view of the whole scheme of
things on earth.

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="13"><p>

In the first place, imagine that the
earth you see is very small, far less than the moon, [
mean; so that when I suddenly peered down I was
long uncertain where the big mountains and the
great sea were, and if I had not spied the Colossus of
Rhodes<ref n="287.2"/> and the lighthouse on Pharos, I vow I
shouldn’t have known the earth at all. But as it
was, the fact that they were high and prominent
and that the ocean glinted in the sun showed me
that what I saw was the earth. But as soon as I
had concentrated my gaze fixedly, the life of man
<note n="287.1">Iliad 13, 4.</note>
<note n="287.2">The Colossus of Rhodes had been lying prostrate for several centuries at the time this dialogue was written. It stood upright for only 56 years (ca. 283-2278.¢.). Consequently the allusion is thought to come from Menippus.</note>

<pb n="289"/>

in its entirety disclosed itself to me, and not only
the nations and cities but the people themselves
as clear as could be, the traders, the soldiers, the
farmers, the litigants, the women, the animals and,
in a word, all the life that the good green earth
supports.<ref n="289.1"/>
<label>FRIEND</label>
What you say is completely beyond belief and
self-contradictory, for you told me just now that you
had to look for the earth because it was diminished
by the intervening distance, and that if the Colossus
hadn’t given you your bearings, perhaps you would
have thought you were looking at something else.
How is it, then, that you have suddenly turned into a
Lynceus and can make out everything on earth—
the men, the animals and very nearly the nests of
the mosquitoes ?

<label>MENIPPUS</label>
Thanks for reminding me; somehow or other I
neglected to say what I certainly should have said.
When I recognised the earth by sight, but was
unable to distinguish anything else on account of the
height, because my vision did not carry so far, the
thing annoyed me excessively and put me in a great
quandary. I was downcast and almost in tears when
the philosopher Empedocles came and stood behind
me, looking like a cinder, as he was covered with
ashes and all burned up. On catching sight of him
I wasa bit startled, to tell the truth, and thought I
beheld a lunar spirit ; but he said “Don’t be alarmed,
Menippus;


<cit><quote><l>No god am I: why liken me to them? </l></quote>
<bibl>Od. 16, 187.</bibl></cit>

<note n="289.1">A reminiscence of Homer; cf. Il. 2, 548 ; Od. 4, 229; 9, 357- 2 Od. 16, 187</note>


<pb n="291"/>

I am the natural philosopher Empedocles, at your
service. You see, when I threw myself head-first
into the crater, the smoke snatched me out of
Aetna and brought me up here, and now I dwell in
the moon, although I walk the air a great deal, and
I live on dew. So I have come to get you out of
your present quandary ; for it annoys and torments
you, I take it, that you cannot clearly see everything
on earth.” “Thank you very much, Empedocles,”
said I; “you are most kind, and as soon as I fly
down to Greece again I will remember to pour you a
drink-offering in the chimney<ref n="291.1"/> and on the first: of
every month to open my mouth at the moon three
times and make a prayer.” “Great Endymion !”
said he, “I didn’t come here for pay; my heart was
touched a bit when I saw you sorrowful. Do you
know what to do in order to become sharp-sighted ?”

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="15"><p>

“No,” said I, “unless you are going to take the mist
from my eyes somehow. At present my sight seems
to be uncommonly blurred.” “Why,” said he, “you
won’t need my services at all, for you yourself have
brought the power of sharp sight with you from
the earth.” “What is it, then, for I don’t know?” I
said. “Don’t you know,” said he, “that you are
wearing the right wing of an cagle?” “Of course,”
said I, “but what is the connection between wings
and eyes?” “This,” said he; “the eagle so far
surpasses all the other creatures in strength of sight
that he alone can look square at the sun, and the
mark of the genuine royal cagle is that he can face
its rays without winking an eye.” “So they say,” I
<note n="291.1">Jn the chimney, because the burned and blackened appearance of Empedocles suggested this as the most appropriate spot; and then too, the smoke goes up to the moon.</note>
291
<pb n="293"/>

replied, “and I am sorry now that when I came up
here I  did not take out my own eyes and put in those
of the eagle. As things are, I have come in a_halffinished condition and with an equipment which is
not fully royal; in fact, I am like the bastard, disowned eaglets they tell about.”<ref n="293.1"/> “Why,” said he,
“it is in your power this minute to have one eye
royal, for if you choose to stand up a moment, hold
the vulture’s wing still, and flap only the other one,
you will become sharp-sighted in the right eye to
match the wing; the other eye cannot possibly help
being duller, as it is on the inferior side.” It will
satisfy me,” said I, “if only the right one has the
sight of an eagle; it would do just as well, for I am
sure I have often seen carpenters getting on better
with only one eye when they were trimming off
timbers to the straight-edge.”


This said, I set about doing as Empedocles advised,
while he receded little by little and gradually dissolved into smoke.

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="16"><p>

No sooner had I flapped the
wing than a great light broke upon me and all that
was formerly invisible was revealed. Bending down
toward earth, I clearly saw the cities, the people and
all that they* were doing, not only abroad but at
home, when they thought they were unobserved. I
saw Ptolemy lying with his sister, Lysimachus’ son
conspiring against his father, Seleucus’ son Antiochus
flirting surreptitiously with his stepmother, Alexander
of ‘Thessaly getting killed by his wife, Antigonus
committing adultery with the wife of his son, and
<note n="293.1">If an eaglet failed to stand the test, he was pushed out of the nest; cf. Aelian de Nat, Anim, 2, 26.</note>
293
<pb n="295"/>

the son of Attalus pouring out the poison for him.
In another quarter I saw Arsaces killing the woman,
the eunuch Arbaces drawing his sword on Arsaces,
and Spatinus the Mede in the hands of the guards,
being dragged out of the dining-room by the leg
after having had his head broken with a golden
cup.<ref n="295.1"/> Similar things were to be seen going on in
Libya and among the Thracians and Scythians in the
palaces of kings—men committing adultery, murdering, conspiring, plundering, forswearing, fearing
and falling victims to the treason of their closest kin.

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="17"><p>

Although the doings of the kings afforded me such
rare amusement, those of the common people were
far more ridiculous, for I could see them too—
Hermodorus the Epicurean perjuring himself for a
thousand drachmas, the Stoie Agathocles going to
law with his disciple about a fee, the orator Clinias
stealing a cup out of the Temple of Asclepius and the
Cynic Herophilus asleep in the brothel. Why mention
the rest of them—the burglars, the bribe-takers, the
money-lenders, the beggars? In brief, it was a motley
and manifold spectacle.

<p><label>FRIEND</label>
Really, you might as well tell about that too,

impossible in such a case, where even to see it all
was hard work. However, the principal features
were like what Homer says was on the shield.<ref n="297.1"/> In
one place there were banquets and weddings, elsewhere there were sessions of court and assemblics ;
in a different direction a man was offering sacrifice,
and close at hand another was mourning a death.
Whenever I looked at the country of the Getae I
saw them fighting ; whenever I transferred my gaze to
the Seythians, they could be seen roving about on their
wagons: and when I turned my eyes aside slightly,
I beheld the Egyptians working the land. The Phoenicians were on trading-ventures, the Cilicians were
engaged in piracy, the Spartans were whipping themselves and the Athenians were attending court.

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="18"><p>

As
all these things were going on at the same time, you
can imagine what a hodge-podge it looked. It is as
if one should put on the stage a company of singers,
or I should say a number of companies, and then
should order each singer to abandon harmony and
sing a tune of his own; with cach one full of
emulation and carrying his own tune and striving to
outdo his neighbour in loudness of voice, what, in the
name of Heaven, do you suppose the song would be
like ?
</p>
<p><label>FRIEND</label>
Utterly ridiculous, Menippus, and all confused.
</p>
<p><label>MENIPPUS</label>
Well, my friend, such is the part that all carth’s
singers play, and such is the discord that makes
<note n="297.1">Iliad 18, 478 ff.</note>
297
<pb n="299"/>

up the life of men. Not only do they sing different
tunes, but they are unlike in costume and move at
cross-purposes in the dance and agree in nothing
until the manager drives each of them off the stage,
saying that he has no further use for him. After
that, “however, they are all quiet alike, no longer
singing that unrhythmical medley of theirs. But
there in the play-house itself, full of variety and
shifting spectacles, everything that took place was
truly laughable.

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="19"><p>

I was especially inclined to laugh at the people who
quarrelled about boundary-lines, and at those who
plumed themselves on working the plain of Sicyon
or possessing the district of Oenoe in Marathon or
owning a thousand acres in Acharnae. As a matter
of fact, since the whole of Greece as it looked to
me then from on high was no bigger than four
fingers, on that scale surely Attica was infinitesimal.
I thought, therefore, how little there was for our
friends the rich to be proud of ; for it seemed to me
that the widest-acred of them all had but a single
Epicurean atom under cultivation. And when I
looked toward the Peloponnese and caught sight
of Cynuria, I noted what a tiny region, no bigger in
any way than an Egyptian bean, had caused so many
Argives and Spartans to fall in a single day.<ref n="299.1"/> Again,
if T saw any man pluming himself on gold because
he had eight rings and four cups, I laughed heartily
at him too, for the whole of Pangacum, mines and
all, was the size of a grain of millet.

But the cities and the men—for Heaven’s sake, how
did they look from on high ?
</p>
<p><label>MENIPPUS</label>
I suppose you have often seen a swarm of ants,
in which some are huddling together about the
mouth of the hole and transacting affairs of state in
public, some are going out and others are coming
back again to the city; one is carrying out the dung,
and another has caught up the skin of a bean or half
a grain of wheat somewhere and is running off with
it; and no doubt there are among them, in due proportion to the habits of ants, builders, politicians,
aldermen, musicians, and philosophers. But however that may be, the cities with their population
resembled nothing so much as ant-hills. If you think
it is belittling to compare men with the institutions
of ants, look up the ancient fables of the Thessalians
and you will find that the Myrmidons, the most
warlike of races, turned from ants into men.
Well, when I had looked and laughed at everything to my heart’s content, I shook myself and flew
upward,

quantities of dreadful abuse from the philosophers,
who have nothing else to do but to bother about me,
what I am, how big I am, and why I become semicircular, or crescent-shaped. Some of them say I am
inhabited, others that I hang over the sea like a
mirror, and others ascribe to me—oh, anything that
each man’s fancy prompts. Lately they even say
that my very light is stolen and illegitimate, coming
from the sun up above, and they never weary of
wanting to entangle and embroil me with him,
although he is my brother; for they were not
satisfied with saying that Helius himself was a stone,
and a glowing mass of molten metal.

I do not think it decent to expose and illumine
those nocturnal pastimes of theirs and their life
behind the scenes. On the contrary, if I see one
of them committing adultery or thieving or making
bold to do anything else that best befits the night,
I draw my garment of cloud together and _ veil

upwards along the road to Heaven,

<bibl>Od. 10, 98.</bibl></cit>


for in a little while even the moon seemed small to me,
and the earth had at last disappeared from my view.
Taking the sun on my right and flying past the
stars, on the third day out I drew near to Heaven.
At first I made up my mind to go straight in without
more ado, for I thought I should easily escape
observation, as I was half eagle and I knew that the
eagle was on intimate terms with Zeus from of old;
but afterwards I concluded that they would very
soon find me out because the other wing that I wore
was a vulture’s. Thinking it best, anyhow, not to
take any unnecessary chances, I went up and knocked
at the door. Hermes answered my knock, inquired
my name, and went off in haste to tell Zeus. In a
little while I was admitted in great fear and
trembling, and found them all sitting together, not
without apprehension themselves; for my visit,
being so unprecedented, had put them in a quiet
flutter, and they almost expected the whole human
race to arrive at any moment, provided with wings
like maine.

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="23"><p>

Zeus, however, looked at me with a


<pb n="307"/>

fierce, Titanic stare and said in a very terrible
voice:

<cit><quote><l>What is your name, sir, whence do you come, and
where is your city and hearth-stone ?</l></quote>
<bibl>The line occurs frequently in the Odyssey, e.g. 1, 170.</bibl></cit>


When I heard this, I nearly dropped dead of
fright, but stood my ground all the same, though
my jaw was hanging and I was thunderstruck by
the loudness of his voice. But in time I pulled
myself together and told him the whole story
clearly, starting at the very beginning—how I
wanted to learn about the heavenly bodies, how I
went to the philosophers, how I heard them contradicting each other, how I got tired of being
pulled this way and that by their arguments, and
then about my idea and the wings and all the rest of
it till my arrival in Heaven ; and at the end I added
the message of the moon. Smiling and unbending
a little, Zeus remarked: “What can one say to Otus
and Ephialtes when even a Menippus has the
hardihood to come up to Heaven? However, we
invite you to be our guest for to-day, and to-morrow,
after we have taken action on the matters about
which you have come, we shall send you away.”
With that he arose and walked toward the best
place in Heaven for hearing, as it was time to sit and
listen to the prayers.
As he walked along he asked me about things on
earth, first the usual questions, how much wheat now
costs in Greece, whether the last winter hit us hard
and whether the crops needed more rain. Then he


<pb n="309"/>

inquired whether any of the descendants of Phidias
were still left, why the Athenians had omitted the
Diasia for so many years, whether they had any idea
of finishing the Olympieion for him and whether the
men who robbed his temple in Dodona had been
arrested.<ref n="309.1"/></p>
<p>
When I had answered these questions, he said:

<quote><l>“Tell me, Menippus, what opinion do men hold
about me?</l></quote>


“Tell me, Menippus, what opinion do men hold
about me?” “What opinion should they hold, sir,”
said I, “except the highest possible one, that you
are king of all the gods?” “You are fond of your
joke,” said he, “but I am thoroughly acquainted
with their craze for novelty even without your telling
me. There was once a time when they looked
upon me as a prophet and a healer, and I was all
in all ;
“Yea, full of Zeus were all the streets
And all the marts of men.’
At that time Dodona and Pisa were rich and highly
regarded by all, and I could not even see for the
smoke of the sacrifices. But since Apollo founded
his oracle at Delphi and Asclepius his hospital in
Pergamos and the temple of Bendis arose in Thrace
and the temple of Anubis in Egypt and the temple
of Artemis in Ephesus, these are the places where
they all run and celebrate feast-days and bring hecatombs, and offer up ingots of gold, while I, they
think, being past my prime, am sufficiently honoured

if they sacrifice to me once every four whole years
at Olympia. Consequently, you can see for yourself
that my altars are more frigid than the Laws of
Plato or the Syllogisms of Chrysippus.”

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="24"><p>
Pursuing such topics, we came to the place where
he had to sit and hear the prayers. There was a
row of openings like mouths of wells, with covers
on them, and beside each stood a golden throne.
Sitting down by the first one, Zeus took off the cover
and gave his attention to the people who were
praying. The prayers came from all parts of the
world and were of all sorts and kinds, for I myself
bent over the orifice and listened to them along
with him. They went like this; “O Zeus, may I
succeed in becoming king!” “O Zeus, make my
onions and my garlic grow!” “QO ye gods, let my
father die quickly!”; and now and then one or
another would say: “O that I may inherit my wife’s
property!” “QO that I may be undetected in my
plot against my brother!” “May I succeed in
winning my suit!” “Let me win the wreath at the
Olympic games!”” Among seafaring men, one was
praying for the north wind to blow, another for the
south wind; and the farmers were praying for rain
while the washermen were praying for sunshine.
Zeus listened and weighed each prayer carefully,
but did not promise everything ;

<cit><quote><l>This by the Father was granted and that was denied
them.</l></quote>
<bibl>Iliad16, 250.</bibl></cit>


You see, he let the just prayers come up through the
orifice and then took them and filed them away at
his right; but he sent the impious ones back un-



<pb n="313"/>

granted, blowing them downward so that they might
not even come near Heaven. In the case of one
petition I observed that he was really in a dilemma :
when two men made contrary prayers and promised
equal sacrifices, he didn’t know which one of them
to give assent to; so that he was in the same plight
as the Academicians and could not make any aflirmation at all, but suspended judgement for a while and
thought it over, like Pyrrho.

When he had given sufficient consideration to the
prayers, he moved to the next throne and the second
opening, leaned down and devoted himself to covenants and people making oaths. After considering
these and annihilating Hermodorus the Epicurean,
he changed his seat to the next throne to give his
attention to omens derived from sounds and sayings
and the flight of birds. Then he moved from there
to the sacrifice-opening, through which the smoke
came up and told Zeus the name of each man who
was sacrificing. On leaving the openings, he gave
orders to the winds and the weather, telling them
what to do: “Let there be rain to-day in Scythia,
lightning in Libya, snow in Greece. North Wind,
blow in Lydia. South Wind, take a day off. Let
the West Wind raise a storm on the Adriatic, and
let about a thousand bushels of hail be sprinkled over
Cappadocia.”

By this time he had pretty well settled everything,
and we went away to the dining-hall, as it was time
for dinner. Hermes took me in charge and gave me
a place beside Pan and the Corybantes and Attis and
Sabazius, those alien gods of doubtful status.
Demeter gave me bread, Dionysus wine, Heracles

meat, Aphrodite perfume and Poseidon sprats. But
I also had surreptitious tastes of the ambrosia and
the nectar, for Ganymede, bless his heart, had so
much of human kindness about him that whenever
he saw Zeus looking another way he would hastily
pour me out a mouthful or two of the nectar. But
as Homer says somewhere or other,<ref n="315.1"/>—having seen
what was there, I suppose, just like me—the gods
themselves neither cat bread nor drink ruddy wine
but have ambrosia sect before them and get drunk on
nectar; and they are especially fond of dining on
the smoke from the sacrifices, which comes up to
them all savoury, and on the blood of the victims
that is shed about the altars when people sacrifice.
During dinner - Apollo played the lute, Silenus
danced the can-can and the Muses got up and sang
us something from Hesiod’s Theogony and the first
song in the Hymns of Pindar.<ref n="315.2"/> When we had had
enough we composed ourselves for the night without
any ceremony, being pretty well soused.

<p>
“There is a class of men which made its

doltish, addle-pated, full of effrontery and to age
the language of Homer, ‘a uscless load to the soil.<ref n="317.1"/>
Well, these people, dividing themselves into schol
and inventing various word-mazes, have called themselves Stoics, Academics, Epicurcans, Peripatetics
and other things much more laughable than these.
Then, cloaking themselves i in the high- sounding name
of Virtue, elevating their eyebrows, wrinkling up
their foreheads and letting their beards grow long,
they go about hiding loathsome habits under a
false garb, very like actors in tragedy ; for if you
take away from the latter their masks and_ their

When Zeus had finished this speech the assembly
fell into a commotion, and at once they all began to
shout: “Blast them,” “Burn them,” “Annihilate
them”; “To the pit,” “To Tartarus,” “To the
Giants.’ Calling for silence once more, Zeus said:
“It shall be as you will; they shall be annihilated,
and their logic with them. However, just at
present it is not in order to punish anyone, for it is
the festival-season, as you know, during the next
four months, and I have already sent about to
announce the truce of God. Next year, therefore,
at the opening of spring the wretches shall die

<head>TIMON, OR THE MISANTHROPE<note><p>It is very doubtful whether the fifth century Timon of
Athens would have récognized himself in this presentment.
The comic poets Of his own day tell us only that he was'a
misanthrope. From Lucian we hear that he became so
through the ingratitude of his friends, who took his money
and then turned their backs upon him, and further that the
discovery of a buried treasure enabled him to requite them
with poetic justice. Of these two essential features of
Lucian’s portrait, the first is older than Lucian, for Plutarch
and Strabo say that Mark Antony, when his friends deserted
him, compared himself with Timon. The second occurs first
in Lucian, and may be his invention. We know, however,
that Antiphanes, a writer of the Middle Comedy, produced a
play called Timon. As the discovery of the treasure and the
punishment of the toadies would make a fitting conclusion
for a comedy, and as it is rather hard to imagine what other
conclusion the comedy of Antiphanes can have had, we
should perhaps credit the whole conception to the imagination of Antiphanes, influenced, possibly, by the history of
“Master Upright” in the Plutus of Aristophanes. It does
not follow, however, that Lucian had read the Timon, for its
plot may have been outlined in the life of Timon which
Neanthes of Cyzicus compiled about200 B.C.</p>
<p>The indebtedness of Shakespeare to Lucian requires no
comment.</p></note></head>

<label>TIMON</label>
Ho, Zeus, you Protector of Friends and Guests and
Comrades, Keeper of the Hearth, Lord of the
Lightning, Guardian of Oaths, Cloud-Compeller,
Loud-thunderer and whatever else crazy poets call
you, above all when they are in trouble with their
verses, for then to help them out you assume a
multitude of names and so shore up the weak spots in
their metre and fill up the gaps in their rhythm!
Where now is your pealing levin, your rolling thunder
and your blazing, flashing, horrid bolt?<ref n="327.1"/> All that
has turned out to be stuff and nonsense, pure poetic
vapour except for the resonance of the names.
That famous, far-flying, ready weapon of yours has
been completely quenched in some way or other
and is cold, not even retaining a tiny spark of
resentment against wrong doers.

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="2"><p>

Indeed, anyone
who should undertake to commit perjury would be
more afraid of a guttering rushlight than of the
blaze of your all-conquering thunderbolt. What
you menace them with is such a mere firebrand, they
think, that they do not fear flame or smoke from it
and expect the only harm they will get from the
stroke is to be covered with soot.
</p>
<p>

That is why even Salmoneus dared to rival your
thunder, and he was far from ineffective at it, for
<note n="327.1">Cf. Eur. Phoen. 182.</note>
327
<pb n="329"/>

he was a man of fiery deeds flaunting his prowess in
the face of a Zeus so lukewarm in spirit. And why
not, when you lie asleep as if you were drugged
with mandragora? You neither hear perjurers nor
see wrong-doers ; you are short-sighted and purblind
to all that goes on and have grown as hard of hearing
as aman in his dotage.

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="3"><p>

Yet while you were still
young and quick-tempered and violent in your wrath,
you were very active against sinners and oppressors
and you never made truce with them then. No,
your bolt was always busy at all costs; your aegis
shook, your thunder pealed, and your lightning was
launched out incessantly like skirmish fire. The
earth shook like a sieve, the snow fell in heaps, the
hail was like cobblestones (if I may talk with you
familiarly), and the rain-storms were fierce and
furious, every drop a river ; consequently, such a flood
took place all in a moment in the time of Deucalion
that when everything else had sunk beneath the
waters a single chest barely escaped to land at
Lycoreus, preserving a vital spark of human seed
for the engendering of greater wickedness.

The result is that you are reaping the fruit of
your laziness. Nobody either sacrifices or wears
wreaths in your honour any longer, except now and
then a man who does it as something incidental to
the games at Olympia; and even in that case he
does not think he is doing anything at all necessary,
but just contributes to the support of an ancient
custom. Little by little, most noble of the gods,
they have ousted you from your high esteem and
are turning you into a Cronus. I will not say how
many times they have robbed your temple already ;
some of them, however, have actually laid their
329
<pb n="331"/>

hands upon your own person at Olympia, and you,
High-thunderer though you be, were too sluggish to
rouse the dogs or to call in the neighbours that they
might come to your rescue and catch the fellows
while they were still packing up for flight. No,
you noble Giant-killer and Titan-conqueror, you sat
still and let them crop your long locks, holding a
fifteen-foot thunderbolt in your right hand !<ref n="331.1"/></p>
<p>
Come, you marvellous ruler, when will you stop
overlooking these things in such a careless way ?
When will you punish all this wrong-doing? How
many conflagrations and deluges will be enough to
cope with such overwhelming insolence in the world ?
For instance, let me put aside generalities and speak
of my own case.

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="5"><p>

After raising so many Athenians
to high station and making them rich when they
were wretchedly poor before and helping all who
were in want, nay more, pouring out my wealth in
floods to benefit my friends, now that I have become
poor thereby I am no longer recognized or even
looked at by the men who formerly cringed and
kowtowed and hung upon my nod. On the contrary,
if I chance to meet any of them in the road, they
treat me as they would the gravestone of aman long
dead which time has overturned, passing by without even a curious glance..-- Indeed, some of them,
on catching sight of me in the distance, turn off in
another direction, thinking that the man who not
long ago showed himself their saviour and benefactor
will be an unpleasant and repulsive spectacle.



Therefore
<note n="331.1">According to Pausanias (v. 11, 1), the Zeus at Olympia held a Victory in his right hand and a sceptre surmounted by an eagle in his left. This is borne out by late coins (see Gardner, Greek Sculpture, p. 259). The error is odd in so good an observer as Lucian.</note>

my wrongs have driven me to this outlying
farm, where, dressed in skins, I till the soil as a
hired labourer at four obols a day, philosophizing
with the solitude and with my pick. By so doing, I
expect to gain at least thus much, that I shall no
longer see a great many people enjoying undeserved
success; for that, certainly, would be more painful.
Come then, son of Cronus and Rhea, shake off at
length that deep, sound sleep, for you have slumbered
longer than Epimenides;<ref n="333.1"/> fan your thunderbolt
into flame or kindle it afresh from Aetna, and make
a great blaze, evincing anger worthy of a stalwart
and youthful Zeus—unless indeed the tale is true
that the Cretans tell about you and your tomb in
their island.

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="6"><p>

<label>ZEUS</label>
Who is that, Hermes, who is shouting from Attica,
near Hymettus, in the foot-hills, all dirty and
squalid and dressed in skins? He is digging, I
think, with his back bent. A mouthy fellow and an
impudent one. Very likely he is a philosopher,
otherwise he would not talk so impiously against
us.
</p>
<p><label>HERMES</label>
What, father! Don’t you know Timon of Collytus, the son of Echecratides? He is the man who
often treated us to perfect sacrifices; the one who
had just come into a fortune, who gave us the complete hecatombs and used to entertain us brilliantly
at his house during the Diasia.

<label>ZEUS</label>
Ah, what a reverse! He the fine gentleman, the
rich man, who had all the friends about him? What
has happened to him to make hin like this, poor
man, a dirty fellow digging ditches and working for
wages, it seems, with such a heavy pick to swing?

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="7"><p>

<label>HERMES</label>
Well, you might say that he was ruined by
kind-heartedness and philanthropy and compassion
on all those who were in want; but in reality it was
senselessness and folly and lack of discrimination in
regard to his friends. He did not perceive that he
was showing kindness to ravens and wolves, and
while so many birds of prey were tearing his liver,
the unhappy man thought they were his friends and
sworn brothers, who enjoyed their rations only on
account of the good-will they bore him. But when
they had thoroughly stripped his bones and gnawed
them clean, and had very carefully sucked out whatever marrow there was in them, they went away and
left him like a dry tree with severed roots, no longer
recognizing him or looking at him—why should they,
pray ?—or giving him help or making him presents in
their turn. So, leaving the city out of shame, he has
taken to the pick and the coat of skin, as you see,
and tills the soil for hire, brooding” crazily over his
wrongs because the men whom he enriched pass him
by very disdainfully without even knowing whether
his name is Timon or not.

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="8"><p>

<label>ZEUS</label>
Come now, we must not overlook the man or neglect him, for he had reason to be angry in view of his
wretched plight. Why, we should be like those vile

<pb n="337"/>

toadies of his if we left a man forgotten who has
burned so many fat thigh-bones of bulls and goats on
the altar to honour us; indeed, I have the steam of
them still in my nostrils!) However, business has
been so heavy, the perjurers and oppressors and
plunderers have made such a hubbub, and I have
been so afraid of the temple-robbers, who are numerous and hard to guard against and do not let me
close my eyes for an.instant, that I haven't even
looked at Attica for a long time, particularly
since philosophy and debates grew rife among the
Athenians, for it is impossible even to hear the
prayers on account of their wrangling and shouting ;
one must therefore either sit with his ears stopped
or be dinned to death with their harangues about
“virtue” and “things incorporeal”’ and other piffle.
That is how I happened to neglect this man, who is
not a bad sort.

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="9"><p>

However, take Riches, Hermes, and go to him
quickly ; let Riches take Treasure along too, and let
them both stay with Timon and not be so ready to
go away, however much he may try to chase them
out of the house again in the kindness of his heart.
About those toadies and the thanklessness which they
showed toward him I shall take measures later, and
they shall be punished as soon as I get my thunderbolt put in order; for the two longest tines of it
are broken and blunted since yesterday, when I let
drive a little too vigorously at the sophist Anaxagoras,
who was teaching his disciples that we gods do not
count at all. I missed him, for Pericles held his

<pb n="339"/>

hand over him,<ref n="339.1"/> and the bolt, glancing off into the
Anaceum, set the temple afire and itself came near
being broken to bits on the rock. But in the meantime it will be punishment enough for them if they
see Timon enormously rich.

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="10"><p>

<label>HERMES</label>
What an advantageous thing it is to shout loudly
and to be annoying and impudent! It is useful not
only to pleaders in court but to petitioners to Heaven.
Lo and behold, Timon, who is now wretchedly poor,
will become rich in an instant because he prayed
vociferously and outspokenly and drew the attention
of Zeus; but if he had bent his back and dug in
silence he would still be digging neglected.
</p>
<p><label>RICHES</label>
But I really can’t go to him, Zeus.

you to do so?

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="11"><p>

Why, by Zeus, because he treated me contumeliously, bundled me out, made ducks and drakes of
me, although I was his father’s friend, and all
but thrust me out of the house with a pitchfork,
throwing me away as people throw hot coals out of
their hands. Am I to go back, then, and be betrayed into the hands of parasites and toadies and
prostitutes ?. Send me to men who will be pleased
with the gift, Zeus, who will be attentive to me, who
hold me in honour and yearn for me, and let these

noddies abide with Poverty, whom they prefer to
me; let them get a coat of skin and a pick from her
and be content, poor wretches, with a wage of four
obols, they who heedlessly fling away ten-talent
gifts.

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="12"><p>

<label>ZEUS</label>
Timon will never again treat you in any such way,
for unless the small of his back is completely insensible, his pick has certainly taught him that he
should have preferred you to Poverty. It seems to me,
however, that you are very fault-finding. Now you
are blaming Timon because he flung his doors open for
you and let you go abroad freely, neither locking you
in nor displaying jealousy ; but at other times it was
quite the reverse’; you used to get angry at the rich
and say that they locked you up with bolts and keys
and seals to such an extent that you could not put
your head out into the light of day. At all events
that was the lament you used to make to me, saying
that you were being stifled in deep darkness. That
was why you presented yourself to us pallid and full
of worries, with your fingers deformed from the habit
of counting on them, and threatened that if you got
a chance you would run away. In short, you thought
it a terrible thing to lead a virginal life like Danae
in a chamber of bronze or iron, and to be brought
up under the care of those precise and unscrupulous
guardians, Interest and Accounts.

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="13"><p>

As a matter of
fact, you used to say that they acted absurdly in that
they loved you to excess, yet did not dare to enjoy
‘you when they might, and instead of giving free
rein to their passion when it lay in their power to do
so, they kept watch and ward, looking fixedly at the
seal and the bolt; for they thought it enjoyment
341
<pb n="343"/>

enough, not that they were able to enjoy you
themselves, but that they were shutting out everyone else from a share in the enjoyment, like the dog
in the manger that neither ate the barley herself nor
permitted the hungry horse to eat it. Moreover,
you laughed them to scorn because they scrimped
and saved and, what is strangest of all, were jealous
of themselves, all unaware that a cursed valet or a
shackle-burnishing steward would slip in by stealth
and play havoc, leaving his luckless, unloved master
to sit up over his interests beside a dim, narrownecked lamp with a thirsty wick. Why, then, is it
not unjust in you, after having found fault with that
sort of thing in the past, to charge Timon with the
opposite now ?

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="14"><p>

<label>RICHES</label>
Really, if you look into the truth, you will think
that I do both with good reason, for Timon’s
extreme laxity may fairly be deemed inconsiderate
and unfriendly toward me; and on the other hand,
when men kept me locked up in dark coffers, taking
pains to get me fat and plump and overgrown, and
neither laid a finger on me themselves nor brought
me out into the light of day for fear that I might be
seen by someone else, I used to consider them
senseless and arrogant because they let me grow
soft in such durance when I had done no wrong,
and were unaware that after a little they would go
away and leave me to some other favourite of fortune.
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="15"><p>

I have no praise, therefore, either for these men or
for those who are very free with me, but only for
those who will do what is best and observe modera-
343
<pb n="345"/>

tion in the thing, neither holding hands off altogether
nor throwing me away outright.
Look at it in this way, Zeus, in the name of Zeus.
If a man should take a young and beautiful woman
for his lawful wife and then should not keep watch
of her or display jealousy at all, but should let her
go wherever she would by night and by day and
have to do with anyone who wished, nay more,
should himself induce her to commit adultery,
opening his doors and playing the go-between and
inviting everybody in to her, would such a man appear to love her?

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="16"><p>

You at least, Zeus, who have
often been in love, would not say so! On the other
hand, suppose a man should take a woman of gentle
birth into his house in due form for the procreation of
children, and then should neither lay a finger on the
ripe and beautiful maiden himself nor suffer anyone
else to look at her, but should lock her up and keep
her a maid, childless and sterile, asserting, however,
that he loved her and making it plain that he did so by
his colour and wasted flesh and sunken eyes. Would
not such a man appear to be out of his mind when,
although he ought to have children and get some
good of his marriage, he lets so fair and lovely a girl
fade by keeping her all her life as if she were vowed
to Demeter? That is the sort of thing I myself am
angry about; for some of them kick me about
shamefully and tear my flesh and pour me out like
water, while others keep me in shackles like a runaway slave with a brand on his forehead.

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="17"><p>
<label>ZEUS</label>
Then why are you angry at them? Both sorts
pay a fine penalty ; for these last, like Tantalus, go
hungry and thirsty and dry-lipped, merely gaping at
345
<pb n="347"/>

their gold, while the others, like Phineus, have their
food snatched out of their mouths by the Harpies.
But be off with you now to Timon, whom you will
find far more discreet.
</p>
<p><label>RICHES</label>
What, will he ever stop acting as if he were in a
leaky boat and baling me out in haste before I have
entirely flowed in, wanting to get ahead of the
entering stream for fear that I will flood the boat and
swamp him? No, and so I expect to carry water to
the jar of the Danaids and pour it in without result, because the vessel is not tight but all that flows
in will run out almost before it flows in, so much
wider is the vent of the jar and so unhindered is
the escape.<ref n="347.1"/>
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="18"><p>

<label>ZEUS</label>
Well, if he doesn’t intend to stop that vent and it
turns out to have been opened once for all, you will
speedily run out and he will have no trouble in finding his coat of skin and his pick again in the lees of
the jar. But be off now and make him rich; and
when you come back, Hermes, be sure to bring me
the Cyclopes from Actna, so that they may point my
thunderbolt and put it in order, for we shall soon
need it sharp.

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="19"><p>

<label>HERMES</label>
Let us be going, Riches. What’s this? You're
limping? I didn’t know that you were lame as well
as blind, my good sir.
<note n="347.1">There are two distinct figures here. In both of them wealth is compared to water; but in the first it leaks in and is ladled out, while in the second it is ladled in and leaks out. In the first figure we want a word meaning “boat,” not ‘“basket”; and I assume therefore that κόφινος means “a coracle” here.</note>

<pb n="349"/>

<label>RICHES</label>
It is not always this way, Hermes. When I go to
visit anyone on a mission from Zeus, for some reason
or other I am sluggish and lame in both legs, so that
I have great difficulty in reaching my journey’s end,
and not infrequently the man who is awaiting me
grows old before I arrive. But when I am to go
away, I have wings, you will find, and am far swifter
than a dream. Indeed, no sooner is the signal given
for the start than I am proclaimed the winner,
after covering the course so fast that sometimes the
onlookers do not even catch sight of me.
</p>
<p><label>HERMES</label>
What you say is not so. I myself could name you
plenty of men who yesterday had not a copper to
buy a rope with, but to-day are suddenly rich and
wealthy, riding out behind a span of white horses
when they never before owned so much as a donkey.
In spite of that, they: go about dressed in purple,
with rings on their fingers, themselves unable to
believe, I fancy, that their wealth is not a dream.

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="20"><p>

<label>RICHES</label>
That is a different matter, Hermes; I do not go
on my own feet then, and it is not Zeus but Pluto
who sends me; for he, too, is a bestower of riches
and a generous giver, as his name implies. When I
am to go from one man to another, they put me in
wax tablets, seal me up carefully, take me up and
carry me away. The dead man is laid out in a dark
corner of the house with an old sheet over his knees,
to be fought for by the weasels, while those who
have expectations regarding me wait for me in the
public square with their mouths open, just as the
349
<pb n="351"/>

swallow’s chirping brood waits for her to tly home.


</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="21"><p>

When the seal is removed, the thread cut, and the
tablets opened, they announce the naine of my new
master, cither a relative or a toady or a lewd slave
held in high esteem since the days of his wanton
youth, with his chin still shaven clean, who in this
way gets a generous recompense, deserving fellow
that he is, for many and various favours which he did
his master long after he had earned a discharge.
Whoever he may be, he snatches me up, tablets and
all, and runs off with me, changing his name from
Pyrrhias or Dromo or Tibius to Megacles or
Megabyzus or Protarchus, while those others who
opened their mouths in vain are left looking at one
another and mourning in earnest because such a
fine fish has made his escape from the inmost
pocket of their net after swallowing quantities of
bait.<ref n="351.1"/>

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="22"><p>

As for the man who has been flung head over
ears into riches, an uncultivated, coarse-grained
fellow who still shudders at the irons, pricks up his
ear if anyone casually flicks a whip in passing, and
worships the mill as if it were the seat of the
mysteries, he is no longer endurable to those who
encounter him, but insults gentlemen and whips his
fellow-slaves, just to see if he himself can do that
sort of thing, until at length he falls in with a prostitute or takes a fancy to breed horses or gives
himself into the keeping of toadies who swear that
he is better looking than Nireus, better born than
Cecrops or Codrus, sharper witted than Odysseus
and richer than sixteen Croesuses in one ; and then
in a moment, poor devil, he pours out all that was

<pb n="353"/>

accumulated little by little through many perjuries,
robberies and villainies.
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="23"><p>

<label>HERMES</label>
Yes, that is just about the way of it. But when
you go on your own feet, how do you find the way,
since you are so blind, and how do you tell who the
people are whom Zeus sends you to because he thinks
they deserve to be rich?
</p>
<p><label>RICHES</label>
Do you suppose I find the way or tell who they
are? Good Heavens, not a bit of it! Otherwise I
would not have left Aristides in the lurch"to--go to
Hipponicus and Callias and a great many others who
do not deserve a copper.<ref n="353.1"/>
<label>HERMES</label>
But what do you do when he sends you down ?
</p>
<p><label>RICHES</label>
I wander up and down, roaming about until I come
upon someone unawares, and that man, whoever he
may be who happens on me, takes me home and
keeps me, paying homage to you, Hermes, for his
unexpected stroke of good-luck.<ref n="353.2"/>

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="24"><p>

<label>HERMES</label>
Then you have cheated Zeus, who thinks that you
observe his decrees and enrich those who in his
opinion deserve riches ?
</p>
<p><label>RICHES</label>
Yes, and very properly, my friend, for although he
<note n="353.1">Hipponicus was the father of Callias, and the son of another Callias, the founder of the family fortunes. There were several sinister stories current about the source of his wealth, but Lucian is probably thinking of the version given by Plutarch in the life of Aristides.</note>

<pb n="355"/>

knew that I was blind, he kept sending me to search
for a thing so hard to find, which long ago became
eclipsed in the world; even a Lynceus could not find
it easily, so dim and tiny is its light. So, as the
good men are few and wicked men in great numbers
fill the cities, it is easier for me to fall in with then
in my wanderings and to get into their nets.
</p>
<p><label>HERMES</label>
Then how is it that when you leave them you
escape easily, since you do not know the way ?
</p>
<p><label>RICHES</label>
For some reason I become sharp of eye and swift
of foot then, but only for the time of ny escape.

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="25"><p>

<label>HERMES</label>
Now just answer me this one more question. How
is it that although you are blind (pardon my frankness), and not only that but pale and heavy-footed, you
have lovers in such number that all men regard you
with adimiration and count themselves lucky if they
win you, but cannot bear to live if they fail? In
fact, I know a good many of them who were so
desperately in love with you that they went and
flung themselves “into the deep-bosomed sea” and
“over the beetling crags”<ref n="355.1"/>



because they thought
you were cutting them when as a matter of fact you
could not see them at all. But you yourself will
admit, I am sure, if you know yourself, that they
are crazy to lose their heads over such a beloved.
</p>
<p><label>RICHES</label>
Do you suppose they see me as I ain, lame and
blind and with all my other bad points ?
<note n="355.1">Theognis 175.</note>


<pb n="357"/>

<label>HERMES</label>
But how can they help it, Riches, unless they
themselves are all blind ?
</p>
<p><label>RICHES</label>
They are not blind, good friend, but Ignorance
and Deceit, who now hold sway everywhere, darken
their vision. Moreover, to avoid being wholly ugly,
I always put on a very lovely mask, gay with tinscl
and jewels, and an embroidered robe before I meet
them ; whereupon, thinking that they sce my beauty
face to face, they fall in love with me and despair
of life if they do not win me. If anyone’ should
strip me and show me to them, without a doubt
they would reproach themselves for being shortsighted to that extent and for falling in love with
things hateful and ugly.

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="26"><p>

<label>HERMES</label>
Why is it, then, that even after they are in the
very midst of riches and have put the mask on their
own face, they are still deluded, and would sooner
lose their head than the mask if anyone should try
to take it away? Surely it is not likely that they
do not know that your beauty is put on when they
see all that is under it.
</p>
<p><label>RICHES</label>
There are many things that help me in this too,
Hermes.
</p>
<p><label>HERMES</label>
What are they ?
</p>
<p><label>RICHES</label>
When a man, on first encountering me, opens his
doors and takes me in, Pride, Folly, Arrogance,
Effeminacy, Insolence, Deceit, and myriads more,
357
<pb n="359"/>

enter unobserved in my train. Once his soul is
obsessed by all these, he admires what he should not
admire and wants what he should shun; he worships
me, the progenitor of all these ills that have come in,
because I am attended by them, and he would
endure anything in the world rather than put up
with losing me.
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="27"><p>
<label>HERMES</label>
But how smooth and slippery you are, Riches,
how hard to hold and how quick to get away! You
offer people no secure grip at all, but make your
escape through their fingers in some way or other,
like an eel or a snake. Poverty, on the other hand,
is sticky and easy to grip, and has no end of hooks
growing out all over her body, so that when people
come near her she lays hold of them at once and
cannot be disengaged easily. But in the midst of
our gossip we have forgotten something rather
important.
</p>
<p><label>RICHES</label>
What is it?
</p>
<p><label>HERMES</label>
We have not brought along Treasure, whom we
needed most.

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="28"><p>

<label>RICHES</label>
Be easy on that score; I always leave him on
earth when I go up to you, bidding him to stay at home
with the door locked and not to open to anyone
unless he hears me calling.
</p>
<p><label>HERMES</label>
Well, then, let’s alight in Attica now. Take hold
of my cloak and follow me till I reach the outlying
farm.

<pb n="361"/>

<label>RICHES</label>
It is very good of you to lead me, Hermes, for if
you should leave me behind I would soon run against
Hyperbolus or Cleon as I strayed about. But what
is that noise as of iron on stone?

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="29"><p>

<label>HERMES</label>
Our friend Timon is digging ina hilly and stony
piece of ground close by. Oho, Poverty is with him,
and so is Toil; likewise Endurance, Wisdom, Manliness, and the whole host of their fellows that serve
under Captain Starvation, a far better sort than your
henchmen.
</p>
<p><label>RICHES</label>
Then why not beat a retreat as quickly as possible,
Hermes? We can’t accomplish anything worth
mentioning with a man that is hedged in by such an
army.
</p>
<p><label>HERMES</label>
Zeus thought differently, so let’s not be cowardly.

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="30"><p>
<label>POVERTY</label>
Where are you going with that person whom you
have by the hand, Hermes?
</p>
<p><label>HERMES</label>
Zeus sent us to Timon here.
</p>
<p><label>POVERTY</label>
Is he sending Riches to Timon now, when I have
made a noble and a valuable man of him, after taking
him over in a wretched plight that was due to Luxury
and putting him in charge of Wisdom and Toil?
Then am I, Poverty, so easy to slight, think you,
and so easy to wrong that I can be robbed of my

<pb n="363"/>

only possession after I have thoroughly perfected
him in virtue, in order that Riches, taking him over
again and giving him into the hands of Insolence
and Pride, may make him soft, unmanly and base as
before, and then return him to me reduced to a
clout?
</p>
<p><label>HERMES</label>
It was the will of Zeus, Poverty.

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="31"><p>

<label>POVERTY</label>
I am going; follow me, Toil and Wisdom and the
rest of you. ‘This man will soon find out whom he is
deserting in me—a good helpmate and a teacher of
all that is best, through whose instruction he kept
well in body and sound in mind, leading the life of
a real man, relying on himself and holding all this
abundance and excess to be nothing to him, as indeed
it is.

<p><label>HERMES</label>
They are going ; let us approach him.

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="32"><p>

<label>TIMON</label>
Who are you, plague take you, and what do you
want that you come here to bother a man at work
and earning his wage? You will go away sorry
that you came, vile wretches that you are, every one
of you; for I'll very soon throw these clods and
stones at you and break every bone in your bodies.
</p>
<p><label>HERMES</label>
No, no, Timon! don’t throw at us, for we are not
men. I am Hermes and this is Riches. We were
sent by Zeus in answer to your prayers. So desist
from your labours and accept prosperity, and good
luck to you!

<label>TIMON</label>
You shall catch it too, even if you are gods, as you
say, for I hate all alike, both gods and men, and as
for this blind fellow, whoever he may be, I shall
certainly break his head with my pick.
</p>
<p><label>RICHES</label>
Let’s go, Hermes, in the name of Zeus, in order
that I may not come to some harm before going ; for
the man is uncommonly crazy, it seems to me.

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="33"><p>

<label>HERMES</label>
Let’s have no roughness, Timon. Lay aside this
excessive rudeness and asperity, stretch out your
hands and take your good fortune. Be rich once
more and a leading man in Athens, and cut the
acquaintance of those ingrates of old, keeping your
wealth to yourself.
</p>
<p><label>TIMON</label>
I don’t want anything of you; don’t bother me. My
pick is riches enough for me, and in all other respects
I am as happy as can be if only nobody comes near
me.
</p>
<p><label>HERMES</label>
Such an uncivil answer, friend ?

<cit><quote><l>Will you I carry to Zeus those words so repellent
and stubborn ?</l></quote>
<bibl>Iliad, 15, 202</bibl></cit>


True enough, it is reasonable for you to hate men
after they have treated you so horribly, but not in
the least to hate the gods, who take such good care
of you.

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="34"><p>

<label>TIMON</label>
I am very much obliged to you, Hermes, and to

<pb n="367"/>

Zeus for the care, but I must decline to take your
friend Riches.
</p>
<p><label>HERMES</label>
Why, pray?
</p>
<p><label>TIMON</label>
Because in bygone days he caused me_ infinite
harm by giving me over to toadies, setting plotters
upon me, stirring up hatred against me, corrupting
me with high living, making me envied and finally
abandoning me in such a faithless and traitorous way.
But my good friend Poverty developed my body
with tasks of the most manly sort, conversed with
me truthfully and frankly, gave me all that I needed
if only I worked for it, and taught me to despise the
wealth I once cherished, making me depend upon
myself for my hope of a living and showing me
wherein lay my own riches, which could not be
taken away either by a toady with flattery or by a
blackmailer with threats, by a mob in a gust of
passion, a voter with his ballot or a tyrant with his
intrigues.

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="35"><p>

Strengthened, therefore, by my labours, I
work upon this farm with pleasure in my toil, secing
nothing of the ills in the city and getting ample and
suflicient sustenance from my pick. So wend your
way back again, Hermes, taking Riches up to Zeus.
For my part, I should be content if I could bring
sorrow to the whole world, young and old alike.
</p>
<p><label>HERMES</label>
Don’t say that, my friend; they do not all deserve
sorrow. Come, stop this childish display of illtemper and take Riches. Gifts that come from Zeus
are not to be flung away.
<pb n="369"/>

<label>RICHES</label>
Do you want ine to rcason with you, Timon, or
shall you be offended at me if I say anything ?
</p>
<p><label>TIMON</label>
Speak, but not at length nor with a preface, like a
rascally orator. I will endure a few words from you
for the sake of Hermes.

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="36"><p>

<label>RICHES</label>
Perhaps I ought really to speak at length in
reply to so many charges made by you. However, judge whether I have wronged you as you
say. It is I who brought you everything that is
delightful,—honour, precedence, civic crowns, and
every form of luxury; and you were admired and
puffed and courted, thanks to me. On the other
hand, if you have suffered any cruel treatment at
the hands of the toadies, I am not to blame; rather
have I myself been wronged by you because you so
basely put me at the mercy of scoundrels who praised
you and bewitched you and intrigued against me in
every way. Again, in closing, you said that I
played you false; but on the contrary I could myself
bring that charge against you, for you drove me off
in every way and thrust me head-foremost out of
your house. That is why Poverty, whom you hold
so dear, has dressed you in this coat of skin instead
of a soft mantle of wool, So Hermes will testify
how ardently I besought Zeus not to make me come
to you again after you had treated me with such
hostility.
</p>
<p><label>HERMES</label>
But now you see how mild he has become, Riches ;
so do not hesitate to remain with him. Timon, go

<pb n="371"/>

on digging without more ado, and you, Riches, bring
Treasure underneath his hoe, for ‘Treasure will obey
your call.
</p>
<p><label>TIMON</label>
I must comply, Hermes, and be rich again, for
what can a man do when the gods constrain him ?
But look at all the trouble you are plunging me
into, curse the luck! Until now I was leading the
happiest of lives, but in a moment, though I have
done no wrong, I am to receive so much gold and to
take on so many cares.

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="37"><p>

<label>HERMES</label>
Endure it, Timon, for my sake, even if it is difficult
and unbearable, in order that those toadies may burst
with envy. And now I am going to fly up to Heaven
by way of Aetna.
</p>
<p><label>RICHES</label>
He has gone, it seems; for I infer it from the
fluttering of his wings. Wait here, and I will go
away and send Treasure to you. But, no, strike in.
Ho, Treasure of Gold! Submit to Timon and let
yourself be dug up. Dig, Timon, and bring down
deep strokes. I will leave you to yourselves.

Come, pick, be strong for me now and don’t flag in
the task of calling Treasure out of the depths to the

Timon and the wealth of Timon! Yes, even the

<p>
Pick and darling coat of skin, it is best that I

what haste they make! They are running up from
all sides, dusty and out of breath, for they scent the
gold somehow or other. Shall I climb this hill and
drive them off with a skirmish fire of stones from

talking to them just this once, in order that they
may be hurt even more by being treated with contempt? That way is better, I think; so let us
stand our ground now and receive them. Let me
see, who is the first of them? Gnathonides the
toady, the man who gave me a rope the other day

up whole jars of wine at my house. I am glad he

Who is this coming up, with the bald pate?
Philiades, the most nauseous toady of them all.

two talents for his daughter in payment for praising
me once, when I had sung a song and everybody else
kept still, but he lauded me to the skies, vowing on
his word of honour that I was a better singer than a

just bringing you a talent so that you might have
something to use for your pressing needs when I
heard on the way, not far from here, that you were
tremendously rich. So I have come to give you this
advice. But as you are so wise, perhaps you will
have no need of suggestions from me, for you could

Lo and behold! here comes a third, the orator
Demeas, holding a resolution in his hand and saying
that he is a relative of mine. That fellow paid the
city treasury sixteen talents within a single day,
getting his money from me, for he had been condemned to a fine and put in jail while it was unpaid.
And yet when it became his duty recently to
distribute the show-money to the Erechtheis tribe,<ref n="381.1"/>
and I went up and asked for my share, he said he
did not recognize me as a citizen !
<note n="381.1">A slip on Lucian’s part, for Collytus belonged to Aegeis. The show-money (theoric fund) was at first given only to cover the cost of admission to state spectacles, but later became a distribution per capita of the surplus funds.</note>

Good day, Timon, great benefactor of your kin,
bulwark of Athens, shield of Greece! ‘The assembly
and both the councils are in session and awaiting
your pleasure this long time. But before you go,
listen to the resolution that I drew up in your
behalf.
“Whereas Timon of Collytus, the son of Echecratides, a man who is not only upright but wise beyond
any other in Greece, labours always in the best
interests of the city, and has won the boxing match,
the wrestling match, and the foot-race at Olympia in
a single day, as well as the horse-races, both with
the regular chariot and with the span of colts””— -
</p>
<p><label>TIMON</label>
But I never was even a delegate<ref n="383.1"/> to the games at
Olympia !
</p>
<p><label>DEMEAS</label>
What of that? You will be, later. It is best to
put in plenty of that sort of thing.
— "and fought bravely for the city at Acharnae vee
and cut to pieces two divisions of Spartans"—

<label>TIMON </label>
What do you mean by that? I wasn’t even posted
on the muster-roll because I had no arms.
</p>
<p><label>DEMEAS</label>
You are modest in talking about yourself, but we
should be ungrateful if we failed to remember.
— “and furthermore has been of great service to
the city by drawing up resolutions and serving on
the council and acting as general ;
<note n="383.1">An official representative of the state. Cf. Aristophanes, Wasps 1188 ff.</note>

“On all these grounds be it resolved by the

and the demes, both severally and in common, to erect
a golden statue of Timon beside Athena on the
Acropolis with a thunderbolt in his hand and a halo<ref n="385.1"/>

of gold, said crowns to be awarded by proclamation
to-day at the Dionysia when the new tragedies
are performed ; for the Dionysia must be held to-day

next of kin and his pupil; for Timon is an excellent
orator and anything else that he wants to be.”

There you have the resolution. I wish I had
brought my son to see you; I have called him Timon
after you.

<p><label>TIMON</label>
How can that be, Demeas, when you aren't even
married, as far as I know?
</p>
<p><label>DEMEAS</label>
No, but I am going to marry next year, Zeus
willing, and havea child ; and I now name it Timon,
for it will be a boy.
</p>
<p><label>TIMON</label>
Perhaps you don’t care to marry now, sirrah, on
getting such a clout from me.
</p>
<p><label>DEMEAS</label>
Oh! Oh! What does this mean? Timon, you
are trying to make yourself tyrant and you are
beating free men when you yourself have not a clear

and for burning the Acropolis too.

But what have we here? Isn’t this Thrasyc yeles ?
No other! With his beard spread out and his eyebrows uplifted, he marches along deep in haughty
meditation, his eyes glaring like a Titan’s and his
hair tossed back from his forehead, a typical Boreas
or Triton such as Zeuxis used to paint. Correct in
his demeanour, gentlemanly in his gait, and inconspicuous in his dress, in the morning hours he discourses forever about virtue, arraigns s the votaries of
pleasure and praises contentment with little; but
when he comes to dinner after his bath and the
387
<pb n="389"/>

waiter hands him a large cup (and the stiffer it is, the
better he likes it) then it is as if he had drunk the
water of Lethe, for his practice is directly opposed to
his preaching of the morning. He snatches the
meat away from others like a kite, elbows his neighbour, covers his beard with gravy, bolts his food like
a dog, bends over his plate as if he expected to find
virtue in it, carefully wipes out the dishes with his
forefinger so as not to leave a particle of the sauce,
and grumbles continually, even if he gets the whole
cake or the whole boar to himself.

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="51"><p>

He is the height
of gluttony and insatiability, and he gets so drunken
and riotous that he not only sings and dances, but
even abuses people and flies into a passion. Besides
he has much to say over his cup—more then than at
any other time, in fact!—about temperance and
decorum, and he says all this when he is already in a
bad way from taking his wine without water and
stammers ridiculously. Then a vomit follows, and at
last he is picked up and carried out of the diningroom, catching at the flute girl with both hands as he
goes. But even when sober, he won’t yield the
palm to anyone in lying and impudence and covetousness ; on the contrary, he is a peerless toady and
he perjures himself with the greatest facility ; humbug is his guide and shamelessness his follower, and
to sum it up, he is a wonderfully clever piece of
work, correct in every detail and perfect in a world
of ways. Therefore he shall soon smart for ;his
superiority. (To Thrasycles): Well, well! I say,
Thrasycles, you are late.

I have not come with the same intent as all this
crowd, Timon. Dazzled by your riches, they have
gathered at a run in the expectation of silver and
gold and costly dinners, meaning to exercise unlimited flattery upon a man so simple and so free
with his gear. You know, of course, that for me
barley-cake is dinner enough, and the sweetest relish
is thyme or cardamom, or if ever I were to indulge
myself, a trifle of salt. My drink is the water of
Nine-spouts, and this philosopher’s mantle suits me
better than any purple robe. As for gold, I hold it
in no higher worth than yonder pebbles on the shore.
It was on your account that I came, in order that
you might not be corrupted by wealth, that most
iniquitous and insidious of possessions, which, many
a time to many a man, has proved a source of irreparable misfortunes. If you take my advice, you will
by all means throw the whole of it into the sea, for it
is not at all essential to a virtuous man who can discern the riches of philosophy; but don’t throw it into
the deep water, my dear fellow: just wade in as far

I wanted to see what it is like in life, Hermes,
what men do in it, and what they lose that makes
them all grieve when they come down to us; for
none of them has ever made the crossing without a
tear. So, like the young Thessalian (Protesilaus), I

fellow guide of souls? Come now, son of Maea, you

never ordered you to bale or take an oar. On the
contrary, you stretch yourself out on deck and
snore, in spite of those broad shoulders of yours, or
if you find a talkative dead man, you chat with him
throughout the trip, while I, old as I am, row both
oars of my boat alone. Come, in your father’s name,
Hermie dear, don’t leave me stranded; be my guide
to everything in life, so that I may feel I have seen
something when I go back. If you leave me, I shall
be no better off than the blind, for they stumble and
reel about in the darkness, while I, to the contrary,

For you to see everything minutely in detail is impossible, ferryman, since it would busy us for many
years. In that event Zeus would be obliged to have
me advertized by the crier, like a runaway slave, and
you yourself would be prevented from doing the

You must determine what is best, Hermes; I
know nothing at all about things above ground, being
a stranger.

<p><label>HERMES</label>
In a word, Charon, we want a high place of some
sort, from which you can look down upon everything.
If it were possible for you to go up into Heaven, we
should be in no difficulty, for you could see everything plainly from on high. But as it is not permissible for one who consorts always with shades to set
foot in the palace of Zeus, we must look about for a
high mountain.

squall strikes the sail and the waves rise high, then
you all in your ignorance tell me to take the sail in

but I urge you to keep quiet, saying that I myself
know what is best. Just so in this case; you must

will Caucasus do, or Parnassus, or Olympus yonder,
which is higher than either? But no, as I looked at
Olympus an idea came to me that is not half bad;
but you must bear a hand and help me out.

Give your orders ; I will help as much as I can,

The poet Homer says that the sons of Alocus, who,
like ourselves, were two in number, took a faney
once upon a time while they were still mere children
to pluck Ossa from its base and set it on Olympus,
and then to set Pelion on top of it, thinking that
this would give them a suitable ladder with which
to scale Heaven.<ref n="403.1"/> Well, these two lads were
sacrilegious and they were punished for it; but we
two are not making this plan to harm the gods, so
why shouldn’t we build in the same way, rolling the
mountains one atop of another, in order to secure a
better view from a higher place?
</p>
<p><label>CHARON</label>
Shall we be able to lift Pelion or Ossa and heave
it up, Hermes, when there are only two of us ?
</p>
<p><label>HERMES</label>
Why not, Charon? Surely you don’t consider us
weaker than that pair of infants? Moreover, we are
gods.
</p>
<p><label>CHARON</label>
No, but the thing seems to me to involve an
incredible deal of work,
<note n="403.1">Od. 11, 305.</note>

<pb n="405"/>

<label>HERMES</label>
Of course, for you are only a prosaic body, Charon,
and not a bit of a poet. Good Homer, however, has
made it possible for us to scale Heaven in a jiffy
with a pair of verses, for he puts the mountains
together as easily as that. I am surprised that you
think this miraculous, for, of course, you know Atlas,
who carries Heaven itself without any help, upholding us all. And no doubt you have heard about
my brother Heracles, how he himself once took the
place of Atlas and relieved him of his load for a
time by taking the burden on his own shoulders.
</p>
<p><label>CHARON</label>
Yes, I have heard that; but whether it is true or
not, Hermes, you and the poets only know!
</p>
<p><label>HERMES</label>
True as can be, Charon. Why should wise men
lie? So let us uproot Ossa first, according to
the directions of the poem and the master-builder,
Homer ;

Oeta too, ferryman, and then Parnassus to top them
all.

all reason, and so tumble down with it and pay
bitterly for our experiment in Homeric building by
breaking our heads.

Never fear; everything will be secure. Move
Oeta over. Roll Parnassus this way. There now, I
am going up again. — It is all right, I see everything:

they are doing and what they are saying. For
instance, when we first met and you saw me laughing
and asked what I was laughing at, I had heard something which amused me vastly.

A man who had been invited to dinner, I take it,
by one of his friends for the next day replied
“Certainly I shall come,” and even as he spoke a tile
from the roof which someone had dislodged fell
on him and killed him. I had to laugh at him
because he did not keep his promise—I_ think
I shall go down a little, so as to see and_ hear
better.

not too auspicious for ‘the passengers, telling how
Poseidon brought the clouds together, stirred up the

excited all the gales and a lot more of it. Thus he
put the sea in a commotion with his verses, and a

consider the most fortunate man in the world ?
</p>
<p><label>CHARON</label>
What will Solon say to that?

<note n="415.1">The conversation that follows is based on Herodotus 1.
29-33.</note>
415
<pb n="417"/>

<label>HERMES</label>
Never fear ; nothing ignoble, Charon.
</p>
<p><label>SOLON</label>
Fortunate men are few, Croesus, but I consider
that of all the men I know, the most fortunate are
Cleobis and Biton, the sons of the priestess at Argos,
who died together the other day when they had
harnessed themselves and drawn their mother to the
temple on the wagon.<ref n="417.1"/>
<label>CROESUS </label>.
Very well, let them have the first rank in good
fortune. But who would be the second? :
</p>
<p><label>SOLON</label>
Tellus of Athens, who lived happily and died for
his country.
</p>
<p><label>CROESUS</label>
But what about me, knave? Don’t you think I
am fortunate ?
</p>
<p><label>SOLON</label>
I do not know, Croesus, and shall not until you
come to the close of your life. Death is a sure test
in such matters, that and a fortunate life right up to
the end.
</p>
<p><label>CHARON</label>
Thank you kindly, Solon, for not forgetting us,<ref n="417.2"/>
but demanding the decision of such matters to be
made right at the ferry.

whom Croesus is sending out, and what are they

<label>HERMES</label>
He is making an offering of golden ingots to Apollo
at Delphi to pay for the prophecies which will bring
him to grief a little later on. The man is monstrously daft on divination.
</p>
<p><label>CHARON</label>
Is that gold, the bright substance that shines, the
pale yellow substance with a cast of red? This is
the first time that I have seen it, though I am always
hearing of it.
</p>
<p><label>HERMES</label>
That is it, Charon, the name that they sing of and
fight for.
</p>
<p><label>CHARON</label>
Really I don’t see what good there is about it,
except perhaps for one thing, that its bearers find it
heavy.
</p>
<p><label>HERMES</label>
You do not know how many wars there have been
on account of it, how many plots, perjuries, murders,
imprisonments, trading ventures, and enslavements.
</p>
<p><label>CHARON</label>
On account of this substance, not much different
from bronze? I know bronze, for, as you are aware,
I collect an obol from everyone who makes the
downward journey.
</p>
<p><label>HERMES</label>
Yes, but bronze is plentiful, so that they do not
prize it very highly, while this is dug up by the
miners at a great depth in small quantities. It
comes from the earth, however, like lead and the
rest of the metals.
419

<pb n="421"/>

<label>CHARON</label>
Men are terribly stupid, by what you say, since
they have such a passion for a yellow, heavy
substance.
</p>
<p><label>HERMES</label>
Well, at any rate Solon yonder does not seem to
love it, Charon, as you see, for he is laughing at
Croesus and his barbarian boastfulness, and to my
mind he wants to ask him a question. Let us listen,
then.

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="11"><p>

<label>SOLON</label>
Tell me, Croesus, do you really think that Apollo
has any need of these ingots?
</p>
<p><label>CROE</label>sUS
Good Heavens, yes! He has nothing to match
them among the votive offerings at Delphi.
</p>
<p><label>SOLON</label>
Then you expect to make the god happy if he adds
ingots of gold to the rest of his possessions ?
</p>
<p><label>CROESUS</label>
Why not?
</p>
<p><label>SOLON</label>
They are very poor in Heaven from what you say,
since they have to send and get gold from Lydia
if they want it.
</p>
<p><label>CROESUS</label>
Why, where else can there be as much gold as
there is in our country ?
</p>
<p><label>SOLON</label>
Tell me, is iron produced in Lydia ?
</p>
<p><label>CROESUS</label>
Not to any great extent.
421
<pb n="423"/>

<label>SOLON</label>
Then you are poor in the better metal.
</p>
<p><label>CROESUS</label>
In what way is iron better than gold ?
</p>
<p><label>SOLON</label>
If you will answer my questions without getting
angry, you will find out.
</p>
<p><label>CROESUS</label>
Ask them, Solon.
</p>
<p><label>SOLON</label>
Who is the better man, the one who saves a life or
the one who is saved by him ?
</p>
<p><label>CROESUS</label>
The one who saves a life of course.
</p>
<p><label>SOLON</label>
Then if Cyrus attacks the Lydians, as rumour has
it that he will, shall you get swords of gold made
for your army, or will iron be necessary in that case?
</p>
<p><label>CROESUS</label>
Iron, certainly.
</p>
<p><label>SOLON</label>
Yes, and if you should not provide iron, your gold
would go off to Persia in captivity.
</p>
<p><label>CROESUS</label>
Don’t speak of such a thing, man!
</p>
<p><label>SOLON</label>
I pray it may not turn out that way; but you
clearly admit that iron is better than gold.
</p>
<p><label>CROESUS</label>
Then would you have me offer ingots of iron to
the god and call the gold back again ?
423
<pb n="425"/>

<label>SOLON</label>
He will have no need of iron either, not he!
Whether you offer bronze or gold, your offering will
be a boon and a blessing to ethers than he—to the
Phocians or the Boeotians or the Delphians themselves, or else to some tyrant or freebooter; but the
god takes little interest in your gold-work.
</p>
<p><label>CROESUS</label>
You are always at war with my wealth and
begrudge me it.
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="12"><p>

<label>HERMES</label>
The Lydian cannot abide the outspokenness and
the truthfulness of his words, Charon; it seems
strange to him when a poor man does not cringe but
says frankly whatever occurs to him. But he will
remember Solon before long, when he has to be captured and put on the pyre by Cyrus. The other day
I heard Clotho reading out the fate that had been
spun for everyone, and among other things it had
been recorded there that Croesus was to be “captured
by Cyrus, and that Cyrus was to be slain by yonder
woman of the Massagetae. Do you see her, the
Scythian woman riding the white horse?
</p>
<p><label>CHARON</label>
Indeed I do.
</p>
<p><label>HERMES</label>
That is Tomyris ; and after she has cut off Cyrus’
head she will plunge it into a wine-skin full of
blood. And do you see his son, the young man?
That is Cambyses ; he will be king after his father,
and when he has had no end of ill-luck in Libya and
425
<pb n="427"/>

Ethiopia he will at last go mad and die in consequence
of slaying Apis.
</p>
<p><label>CHARON</label>
How very funny! But now who would dare to
look at them, so disdainful are they of the rest of
the world? And who could believe that after a
little the one will be a prisoner and the other will
have his head in a sack of blood? But who is that
man, Hermes, with the purple mantle about him, the
one with the crown, to whom the cook, who has just
cut open the fish, is giving the ring,

<cit><quote><l>All in a sea-girt island; a king he would have us

<label>HERMES</label>
You are good at parody, Charon. ‘The man whom
you see is Polycrates, the tyrant of Samos, who
considers himself wholly fortunate; yet the servant
who stands at his elbow, Maeandrius, will betray him
into the hands of the satrap Oroetes, and he will
be crucified, poor man, after losing his good fortune
inamoment’s time. This, too, I heard trom Clotho.
</p>
<p><label>CHARON</label>
Well done, Clotho, noble lady that you are!
Burn them, gracious lady, cut off their heads and
crucify them, so that they may know they are
human. In the meantime let them be exalted,
only to have a sorrier fall from a higher place. For
my part I shall laugh when I recognize them aboard
my skiff, stripped to the skin, taking with them
neither purple mantle nor tiara nor throne of gold.

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="13"><p>
<label>HERMES</label>
That is the way their lives will end. But do you
see the masses, Charon, the men voyaging, fighting,
litigating, farming, lending money, and begging ?
</p>
<p><label>CHARON</label>
I see that their activities are varied and their life
full of turmoil ; yes, and their cities resemble hives,
in which everyone has a sting of his own and stings
his neighbour, while some few, like wasps, harry
and plunder the meaner sort. But what is that
crowd of shapes that flies about them unseen ?
</p>
<p><label>HERMES</label>
Hope, Fear, Ignorance, Pleasure, Covetousness,
Anger, Hatred and their like. Of these, Ignorance
mingles with them down below and shares their
common life, and so do Hatred, Anger, Jealousy,
Stupidity, Doubt, and Covetousness; but Fear and
Hope hover up above, and Fear, swooping down
from time to time, terrifies them and makes them
cringe, while Hope, hanging overhead, flies up and
is off when they are most confident of grasping her,
leaving them in the lurch with their mouths open,
exactly as you have seen Tantalus served by the
water down below.

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="14"><p>

If you look close, you will also
see the Fatés up above, drawing off each man’s
thread from the spindle to which, as it happens, one
and all are attached by slender threads. Do you see
cobwebs, if I may call them so, coming down to each
man from the spindles? .
429
<pb n="431"/>

<label>CHARON</label>
I see that each man has a very slender thread, and
it is entangled in most cases, this one with that and
that with another.
</p>
<p><label>HERMES</label>
With good reason, ferryman; it is fated for that
man to be killed by this man and this man by
another, and for this man to be heir to that one,
whose thread is shorter, and that man in turn to this
one. That is what the entanglement means. You
see, however, that they all hang by slender threads.
Furthermore, this man has been drawn up on high
and hangs in mid-air, and after a little while, when
the filament, no longer strong enough to hold his
weight, breaks and he falls to earth, he will make
a great noise; but this other, who is lifted but
little above the ground, will come down, if at all, so
noiselessly that even his neighbours will hardly hear
his fall.
</p>
<p><label>CHARON</label>
All this is very funny, Hermes.

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="15"><p>

<label>HERMES</label>
Indeed, you cannot find words to tell how ridiculous it is, Charon, especially their inordinate ambition and the way in which they disappear from
the scene in the midst of their hopes, carried off
by our good friend Death. His messengers and
servants are very many, as you see—chills, fevers,
wasting sicknesses, inflammations of the lungs,
swords, pirate vessels, bowls of hemlock, judges, and
tyrants ; and no thought of any of these occurs to
them while they are prosperous, but when the
come to grief, many are the cries of “Oh!” and
431
<pb n="433"/>

“Ah!” and “O dear me!” If they had realized
at the very beginning that they were mortal, and
that after this brief sojourn in the world they
would go away as from a dream, taking leave of
everything above ground, they would live more
sanely and would be less unhappy after death.<ref n="433.1"/>
But as it is, they have imagined that what they
have now will be theirs forever, and so, when the
servant, standing at their bedside, summons them
and hales them off in the bonds of fever or consumption, they make a great to-do about it, for they
never expected to be torn away from their gear. For
example, that man who is busily building himself a
house and driving the workmen on; w hat would not
he do if he knew that although the house will be
finished, as soon as he gets the roof on, he himself will
depart and leave his heir the enjoyment of it without even dining in it, poor fellow? And as for the
man over there, who rejoices because his wife has
borne him a son and entertains his friends in
honour of the occasion and gives the boy his
father’s name, if he knew that the boy willdie atthe
age of seven, do you think he would rejoice over
his birth? No, it is because he sees yonder man
who is fortunate in his son, the father of the athlete
who has been victor at the Olympic games, but
does not see his next door neighbour, who is burying
his son, and does not know what manner of thread
his own son has been attached to. Again, take
those who quarrel about boundaries—you see how
numerous they are; likewise those who heap up
<note n="433.1">Most of the dead are unhappy, as Hermes and Charon well know. See the Downward Journey, and even Homer’s Achilles (Odyssey 11, 488).</note>

<pb n="435"/>

money and then, before enjoying it, receive a
summons from the messengers and servants that I
mentioned.

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="16"><p>

<label>CHARON</label>
I see all this, and am wondering what pleasure
they find in life and what it is that they are distressed to lose. For example, if one considers their
kings, who are counted most happy, quite apart from
the instability and uncertainty of their fortune
which you allude to, one will find that the pleasures
which they have are fewer than the pains, for terrors,
alarums, enmities, plots, rage, and flattery are with
them always. I say nothing of sorrows, diseases,
and misadventures, which of course dominate them
without partiality ; but when their lot is hard, one is
driven to conjecture what the lot of common men
must be.
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="17"><p>

Let me tell you, Hermes, what I think men and
the whole life of man resemble. You have noticed
bubbles in water, caused by a streamlet plashing
down—I mean those that mass to make foam?
Some of them, being small, burst and are gone in an
instant, while some last longer and as others join
them, become swollen and grow to exceeding great
compass ; but afterwards they also burst without fail
in time, for it cannot be otherwise. Such is the life
of men; they are all swollen with wind, some to
greater size, others to less; and with some the
swelling is short-lived and swift-fated, while with
others it is over as soon as it comes into being ; but
in any case they all must burst.
<pb n="437"/>

<label>HERMES</label>
Charon, your simile is every bit as good as Homer's,
who compares the race of man to leaves.<ref n="437.1"/>

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="18"><p>

<label>CHARON</label>
And although they are like that, Hermes, you see
what they do and how ambitious they are, vying
with each other for offices, honours, and possessions,
all of which they must leave behind them and come
down to us with but a single obol. As we are ina
high place, would you like me to call out in a great
voice and urge them to desist from their vain labours
and live always with death before their eyes, saying :
“Vain creatures, why have you set your hearts on
these things? Cease toiling, for your lives will not
endure forever. Nothing that is in honour here
is eternal, nor can a man take anything with him
when he dies; nay, it is inevitable that he depart
naked, and that his house and his land and his
money go first to one and then to another, changing
their owners.” If I should call to them out of a
commanding place and say all this and more, do you
not think that they would be greatly assisted in life
and made saner by far ?
</p>
<p><label>HERMES</label>
My dear fellow, you do not know how Ignorance
and Error have served them. Even a drill could not
penetrate their ears now, because these dames have
stopped them with such quantities of wax, like
Odysseus, who did this to his comrades for fear that
they might hear the Sirens. How could they hear,
then, even if you should crack your lungs with
bawling? What lies in the power of Lethe down

437
<pb n="439"/>

below is done by Ignorance here. However, there
are a few of them who have not admitted the wax
into their ears, who are devoted to truth, who look
keenly into things and know them for what they
are.
</p>
<p><label>CHARON</label>
Then let us call to them at least.
</p>
<p><label>HERMES</label>
It would be superfluous to tell them what they
know. You see how they stand aloof from the
masses and laugh at what goes on ; they are not in
the least satisfied with it all, but are clearly planning
to make their escape from life to your own regions.
Indeed, they have reason, for they are disliked
because they expose the follies of man. ¢
</p>
<p><label>CHARON</label>
Well done, staunch souls! But they are very few,
Hermes.
</p>
<p><label>HERMES</label>
Even these are enough. But let us go down now.

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="19"><p>

<label>CHARON</label>
There is one thing more that I wanted to know
about, Hermes, and when you point it out to me you
will have done your full duty as guide; it is to see
the places where they stow the bodies, where they
bury them, I mean.
</p>
<p><label>HERMES</label>
They call such places vaults, tombs and graves.
Do you see those heaps of earth and slabs of stone
and pyramids in front of the cities? All those
are for the reception of corpses and the storage of
bodies.
439
<pb n="441"/>

<label>CHARON</label>
Why is it, then, that those people are putting
garlands on the stones and anointing them with
perfume ? There are others also who have built
pyres in front of the mounds and have dug trenches,
and now they are burning up those fine dinners and
pouring wine and mead, as far as one may judge,
into the ditches.
</p>
<p><label>HERMES</label>
I don’t know what good these things are to men
in Hades, ferryman; they are convinced, however,
that the souls, allowed to come up from below, get
their dinner as best they may by flitting about the
smoke and steam and drink the mead out of the
trench.
</p>
<p><label>CHARON</label>
What, they eat and drink, when their skulls are
dry as tinder? But it is silly for me to tell that to
you, who bring them down below every day; you
know whether they can come back to earth when
they have once gone under ground! I should be in
a fine predicament, Hermes, and should have no end
of trouble if I were obliged not only to bring them
down but to bring them up to drink ! What folly,
the idiots ! They do not know what an impassable
frontier divides the world of the dead from the
world of the living, and what it is like among us;

Heracles! What a lot of Homer you are baling
out! Now you have put me in mind of him, I want
to show you the tomb of Achilles. Do you see it,
there by the seaside ?_ Sigeum in Troy is over there,
and opposite to it Ajax lies buried on Rhoeteum.
</p>
<p><label>CHARON</label>
The tombs are not large, Hermes. But now show
me the prominent cities that we hear of down below,
Nineveh, the city of Sardanapalus, Babylon, Mycenae,
Cleonae, and Troy itself; I remember that I set a
great many from that place across the ferry, so that
for ten whole years I couldn’t dock my boat or dry
her out.
</p>

As for Nineveh, ferryman, it is already gone and
there is nota trace of it left now; you couldn't even
say where it was. But there you have Babylon, the
city of the beautiful towers and the great wall, which
will itself soon have to be searched for like Nineveh.
I am ashamed to show you Mycenae and Cleonae,
and Troy above all; for I know right well that when
you go down-you will throttle Homer for the boastfulness of his poems. Yet they were once flourishing,
though now they too are dead ; cities die as well as

those people at war yonder, and why are they killing

What folly! They do not know that even if any

race after another, and many a time they will turn

<head>PHILOSOPHIES FOR SALE<note><p>This is not a sale of philosophers, nor yet, in any ordinary sense, a sale of lives; it is a sale of various types of the philosophic life, which are to serve their buyers as models for the shaping of their own careers. For a convenient rendering, perhaps "philosophies” will do as well as any
other single word.</p>
<p>Although Lucian makes it perfectly plain that he is not selling specific philosophers, some, if not all, the manuscripts and all the editors ascribe the words of the different types to definite individuals, whereby they not only introduce confusion into the dialogue (working special havoc in the case of the Academic or Platonist type), but they completely stultify the plea which Lucian puts forward in his own defence in the Fisherman, urging that he had not criticized the leading lights of philosophy, but only the common herd of pretended philosophers. This plea is rather specious, it must be admitted, for Lucian vivifies his types again and again with biographical traits ; but we should leave him a leg to stand on, and not make him sell Pythagoras, Chrysippus and the rest in their own persons. Therefore I have substituted the names of schools for the names of individual philosophers throughout, but only in the English version: for in the Greek I have not ventured to do this without commanding fuller evidence from the manuscripts.</p>
<p>Diogenes was once taken by pirates and sold into slavery, they say, and Menippus is known to have written a Sale of Diogenes. It may be that Lucian read it and took a hint from it: he could not have taken more.</p>
<p>The order in which the different types are brought on is very effective, as Helm points out, and well deserves attention as one reads. Interesting too are the prices which they bring.</p></note></head>

I shall teach thee nothing, but make thee remember.<ref n="455.1"/>
<label>BUYER</label>
How will you make me remember ?
</p>
<p><label>PYTHAGOREAN</label>
First by making thy soul pure and purging off the

<p><label>BUYER</label>
Well, imagine that my purification is complete,
what will be your method of making me remember?
</p>
<p><label>PYTHAGOREAN</label>
In the first place, long silence and speechlessness,
and for five entire years no word of talk.
</p>
<p><label>BUYER</label>
My good man, you had better teach the son of
Croesus!?<ref n="455.2"/> I want to be talkative, not a graven
image. However, what comes after the silence and

Why, has fire form, or air, or water ?

Yea, very notably, for without shape and form

I eat nothing at all that hath life, but all else save

Why so? Do you dislike beans?

<p><label>PYTHAGOREAN</label>
Nay, but they are holy, and wonderful is their
nature. First, they are nought but seed of man, and
if thou open a bean while it is still green, thou wilt
see that it resembleth in structure the member of a

wilt make blood. But more than this, the

beans.<ref n="459.1"/>

What use could a man make of him, filthy as he is,
and in such a wretched condition? However, he
might be made a shoveller or a drawer of water.

Not only that, but if you make him doorkeeper,

<label>BUYER</label>
Come here, my good fellow, and tell your buyer
what you are like, and first of all whether you are
not displeased with being sold and living in slavery?
</p>
<p><label>STOIC</label>
Not at all, for these things are not in our control,
and all that is not in our control is immaterial.
</p>
<p><label>BUYER</label>
I don’t understand what you mean by this.
</p>
<p><label>STOIC</label>
What, you do not understand that of such things
some are “approved,” and some, to the contrary,
“disapproved”’ ?<ref n="489.1"/>
<label>BUYER</label>
Even now I do not understand.
</p>
<p><label>STOIC</label>
Of course not, for you are not familiar with our
vocabulary and have not the faculty of forming concepts; but a scholar who has mastered the science of
logic knows not only this, but what predicaments
and bye-predicaments are, and how they differ from
each other.<ref n="489.2"/>
<label>BUYER</label>
In the name of wisdom, don’t begrudge telling me

<note n="489.1"> Just as things "in our control” were divided into the good and the bad, so those "not in our control” were divided into the “approved” and the "disapproved,” according as they helped or hindered in the acquirement of virtue.</note>

<note n="489.2">The hair-splitting Stoics distinguished four forms of predication according to the case of the (logical) subject and the logical completeness of the predicate : the direct, complete predicate, or σύμβαμα (predicament), i.e. Σωκράτης βαδίζει; the indirect, complete predicate, or παρασύμβαμα (bye-predicament), i.e. Σωκράτει μεταμέλει ; the direct, incomplete predicate, e.g. Σωκράτης φιλεῖ, and the indirect, incomplete predicate, i.e. Σωκράτει μέλει.</note>

<pb n="491"/>

at least what predicaments and bye-predicaments are ;
for I am somehow impressed by the rhythm of the
terms.
</p>
<p><label>STOIC</label>
Indeed, I do not begrudge it at all. If a man who
is lame dashes his lame foot against a stone and
receives an unlooked-for injury, he was already in a
predicament, of course, with his lameness, and with
his injury he gets into a bye-predicament too.

<label>BUYER</label>
Oh, what subtlety! And what else do you claim to
know best ?
</p>
<p><label>STOIC</label>
The word-snares with which I entangle those who
converse with me and stop their mouths and make
them hold their peace, putting a very muzzle on

What of it ?

If a crocodile should seize it on finding it straying
beside the river, and then should promise to give it
back to you if you told him truly what he intended

to do about giving it back, what would you say he
had made up his mind to do?<ref n="493.1"/>
<label>BUYER</label>
Your question is hard to answer, for I don’t know
which alternative I should follow in my reply, in
order to get back the child. Come, in Heaven’s
name answer it yourself and save the child for me,
for fear the beast may get ahead of us and devour it !
</p>
<p><label>STOIC</label>
Courage! I'll teach you other things that are more
wonderful.
</p>
<p><label>BUYER</label>
What are they ?
</p>
<p><label>STOIC</label>
The Reaper, the Master,<ref n="493.2"/> and above all, the Electra
and the Veiled Figure.
</p>
<p><label>BUYER</label>
What do you mean by the Veiled Figure and the
Electra ?
</p>
<p><label>STOIC</label>
The Electra is the famous Electra, the daughter of
Agamemnon, who at once knew and did not know
the same thing; for when Orestes stood beside her
before the recognition she knew that Orestes was


<note n="493.1">The commentators do not seem to have noticed that
Lucian has (intentionally) spoiled the sophism by using the
words δέδοικα and ἐγνωκέναι. It is perfectly possible for the
father to guess what the crocodile “had made up his mind”
to do, and so to get the child back: for an intention need
not be executed. The crocodile should ask, ‘* Am I going to
(μέλλω) give up the child?” Then, if the father answers
“Yes,” he will say ‘ You are wrong,” and eat it: and if
the father says “No,” he will reply “You are right;
therefore I am not going to give it up.”</note>
<note n="493.2">Neither of these are accurately known. The Reaper was based on the fallacious employment of the negative, and proved that a man who was going to reap a field could not possibly reap it. Zeno, the founder of the Stoic school, is said to have paid 200 minas to a logician who taught him seven varieties of this fallacy. The Master consisted of four propositions, of which you could take any three and disprove the fourth.</note>

her brother, but did not know that this was Orestes.<ref n="495.1"/>
As to the Veiled Figure, you shall hear a very
wonderful argument. Tell me, do you know your
own father ?
</p>
<p><label>BUYER</label>
Yes.
</p>
<p><label>STOIC</label>
But if I put a veiled figure before you and asked
you if you know him, what will you say?
</p>
<p><label>BUYER</label>
That I don’t, of course.

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="22"><p>

<label>STOIC</label>
But the veiled figure turns out to be your own
father ; so if you don’t know him, you evidently don’t
know your own father.
</p>
<p><label>BUYER</label>
Not so: I should unveil him and find out the
truth! But to go on—what is the purpose of your
wisdom, and what shall you do when you reach the
summit of virtue ?
</p>
<p><label>STOIC</label>
I shall then devote myself to the chief natural
goods, I mean wealth, health, and the like.<ref n="495.2"/> But
first I must go through many preparatory toils,
whetting my eyesight with closely-written books,

<note n="495.1">Here again Lucian does scant justice to the fallacy,
which he really gives away by his statement of it. It
should run: ‘she at once knew and did not know that
Orestes was her brother, for she did not know that this man
was her brother; but this man was Orestes.”</note>

<note n="495.2">As the Stoics set great store by “living in harmony with
nature,” they divided “things which did not matter”
into the “acceptable” and the ‘ unacceptable” according

as they were in or out of harmony with the natural wants of
man. This did not supersede the classification alluded to
above, but was convenient because it enabled them to dispose
of certain things which were hard to classify on the other
basis. For instance, a good complexion is neither “approved”
nor "disapproved” as an aid to the acquirement of virtue,
but it is in harmony with nature, and therefore “‘ acceptable.”
Hence the Stoics were often accused (as they are constantly
accused by indirection in this dialogue) of setting up a double
standard.</note>

solecisms and uncouth words; and to cap all, a man
may not become wise until he has taken the hellebore
treatment three times running.<ref n="497.1"/>
<label>BUYER</label>
These projects of yours are noble and dreadfully
courageous. But tobe a Gnipho and a usurer—for I
see that this is one of your traits too—what shall we
say of this? That it is the mark of a man who has
already taken his hellebore-treatment and is consumuinate in virtue ?
</p>
<p><label>STOIC</label>
Yes; at any rate money-lending is especially
appropriate to a wise man, for as drawing inferences
is a specialty of his, and as money-lending and
drawing interest is next-door to drawing inferences,
the one, like the other, belongs particularly to the
scholar: and not only getting simple interest, like
other people, but interest upon interest. For don’t
you know that there is a first interest and a second
interest, the offspring,<ref n="497.2"/> as it were, of the first? And
you surely perceive what logic says: “If he gets
the first interest, he will get the second; but he
will get the first, ergo he will get the second.”

Then we are to say the same of the fees that you
get for your wisdom from young men, and obviously
none but the scholar will get paid for his virtue ?

<label>STOIC</label>
Your understanding of the matter is correct. You
see, I donot take pay on my own account, but for the
sake of the giver himself: for since there are two
classes of men, the disbursive and the receptive, I
train myself to be receptive and my pupil to be
disbursive.
</p>
<p><label>BUYER</label>
On the contrary, the young man ought to be
receptive and you, who alone are rich, disbursive !

You are joking, man. Look out that I don’t shoot
you with my indemonstrable syllogism.<ref n="499.1"/>

Perplexity and aphasia and a sprained intellect.

In this way. Isa stone a substance?
