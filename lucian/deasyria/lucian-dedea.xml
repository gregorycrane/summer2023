	<head>The Sacred City</head><p>
There is in Syria a city not far from the river
Euphrates<ref n="1"/>: it is called “the Sacred City,” and is sacred
to the Assyrian Hera.<ref n="2"/> As far as I can judge this name
was not conferred upon the city when it was first settled,
but originally it bore another name.<ref n="3"/> In course of time

<note n="1"><p>Identified with the ruins of modern Mumbidj, on a
route from Aleppo to the junction of the Sajur River with
the Euphrates, from which point it is distant 144 miles
(23 kilometres). Cf. Smith’s Dict. of Greek and Roman
Geog.—HIERAPOLIS. The distance accords with that given
by a fifth century pilgrim,?2 Etheria [Silvia]; cf. Corp.
Script. Eccl. Lat., xxxix. p. 61, cited by Hogarth, Jour.
Hell. Stud., xiv. (1907-8), p. 183. Strabo (xvi. i. 28) gives
the distance as four scheni from the river. For early
explorers’ descriptions of the site, see quotations in the
Appendix, pp. 92-95. Many of the fine remains of Roman,
Saracenic, Seljukian and Moslem times are now in ruins,
but the sacred lake and other features are still to be seen
(see note 55).</p></note>

<note n="2"><p>Cf. § 31. By the words “Assyrian Hera” Lucian
tersely identifies the goddess and distinguishes her attri-
butes:—“Hera,” because mated (§ 31) to a “Zeus”;
“Assyrian,’” because she is to be distinguished from the
classical conception of the deity. For this use of the term
Assyrian in the sense of North Syrian (or Aramaean), cf.
Rob.-Smith, Eng. Hist. Rev., 1887, pp. 312, 313; and note
Lucian’s reference to himself below as an “Assyrian born.”
On the name of the goddess, Atargatis, which appears on
local coins and is mentioned by Strabo, Pliny, Macrobius,
etc., see Introduction, pp. 1, 21; and note 25 below.</p></note>

<note n="3"><p>Its name in Hittite and subsequent Assyrian period has
not been recognised. “Bambyce” seems to be the earliest
name substantiated, and it came to be called “Hierapolis”
(“the sacred city’) by the Greeks. Strabo (xvi. i. 28)
mentions another name, Edessa, but this is an obvious
error. Pliny states that the local Syrian name was Mabog,

<head>Origins of Temples and Shrines.</head>

The first men on earth to receive knowledge of the
gods, and to build temples and shrines and to summon
meetings for religious observances are said to have been
the Egyptians.<ref n="5"/> They were the first, too, to take cog-

which there are traces [cf. Land of the Hittites (hereafter

pl. xvii.; Humann and Puchstein, Retsen, Atlas,
pl. xlix. 1-3], was on the Mitannian and later the Assyrian
frontier, and by the Assyrians several times attacked, as in 1120 B.c. and again about 885 B.c. About 750 B.c. it was
in possession of the Vannic kings, and it was finally annexed
to the Assyrian empire about 743 B.c. Nineveh fell to the
Medes in 606. After the period of Persian domination it
became first capital of the province of Commagene in the
Greek kingdom of Syria. The district was later ruled by
independent princes of Seleucid extraction. Subsequently
the seat of government was transferred to Hierapolis.</p></note>

nizance of holy names, and to repeat sacred traditions.
Not long after them the Assyrians heard from the
Egyptians their doctrines as to the gods, and they reared
temples and shrines: in these they placed statues and
images.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="3">
<head>Hercules of Tyre.</head>
<p>
Originally the temples of the Egyptians possessed
no images. And there exist in Syria temples of a date
not much later than those of Egypt, many of which I
have seen myself, for instance, the temple of Hercules
in Tyre.<ref n="6"/> This is not the Hercules of Greek legend; but
a Tyrian hero of much greater antiquity than he.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="4">
<head>The Pheenician Astarte at Sidon. Legend of Europa</head><p>
There is likewise in Phoenicia a temple of great
size owned by the Sidonians. They call it the temple of
Astarte.<ref n="7"/> I hold this Astarte to be no other than the

<note n="6"><p>Hercules of Tyre. Cf. Herodotus, ii. 44, who records
the local tradition that the temple was 2,300 years old, and
convinced himself that this Hercules was a god of very
great antiquity. Rawlinson (Hist. of Phenicia, p. 330)
points out his identity with Melkarth, who originally repre-
sented one aspect of Baal. Similarly the Hittite god
represented in the rock sculpture at Ivriz in Asia Minor
(L. H., pl. lvii. and pp. 192-195) was identified by the
Greeks with Hercules; and is recognised by Frazer (Adonis,
Altis and Osiris, p. 97) as identical with the Baal of Tarsus.
Cf. also Ramsay, Luke the Physician, pp. 171-179, and a
note in his Pauline and other Studies, pp. 172-173, and
note 47 below.</p></note>

<note n="7"><p>The Phoenician Astarte [‘Astart], the goddess of pro-
ductivity in Nature, particularly in the animal world, and
hence the guardian of births. Like the Dea Syria, she is
differentiated only by local custom or tradition from other
aspects of the Mother-goddess. As the natural consort and
counterpart of Baal, who embodied the generative principle,
“bringing all things to life everywhere,” and thus regarded
as the sun-god, she was queen of heaven, and hence the
moon-goddess. Another symbolism connected with the
legend which follows makes her the Cow-goddess in relation
to the Bull-god. Cf. Robertson-Smith, Religion of the Semiies,
Pp. 477. These purely feminine attributions reflect a
patriarchay state of society, with the male god dominant.
(Cf. the interesting remarks by Rob. Smith in the Eng. Hist.
Rev., 1887, p. 316.) Among the Greeks and Romans, who
recognised in Baal their Zeus or Jupiter, the goddess
appeared most like to Aphrodite or Venus, whose prototype
she was. She is the Ashtoreth for whom Solomon erected a
shrine (1 Kings, ii. 5, 33), which was defiled by Josiah
(2 Kings, xxiii. 13), who “brake in pieces the images and cut
down the groves.” In cult and in name she is the local
form of the Babylonian Ishtar, see Introduction, pp. 1, 16.</p></note>

moon-goddess. But according to the story of one of the
priests this temple is sacred to Europa, the sister of
Cadmus. She was the daughter of Agenor, and on her
disappearance from Earth the  Phoenicians honoured her
with a temple and told a sacred legend about her; how
that Zeus was enamoured of her for her beauty, and
changing his form into that of a bull carried her off into
Crete.<ref n="8"/> This legend I heard from other  Phoenicians as
well; and the coinage current among the Sidonians
bears upon it the effigy of Europa sitting upon a bull,
none other than Zeus.<ref n="9"/> Thus they do not agree that the
temple in question is sacred to Europa.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="5"><p>
The Phoenicians have also another sacred custom,
derived from Egypt, not from Assyria: it came, they
say, from Heliopolis into Phcoenicia. I never witnessed
this myself, but it is important, and of great antiquity.

the “Zeus” of Hierapolis is represented sitting on bulls, as

the facts occurred in their country, and in memory of
this calamity they beat their breasts and wail every
year, and perform their secret ritual amid signs of
mourning through the whole countryside. When they
have finished their mourning and wailing, they sacrifice
in the first place to Adonis, as to one who has departed
this life: after this they allege that he is alive again,
and exhibit his effigy to the sky. They proceed to
shave their heads,<ref n="13"/> too, like the Egyptians on the loss
of their Apis. The women who refuse to be shaved
have to submit to the following penalty, viz., to stand
for the space of an entire day in readiness to expose
their persons for hire. The place of hire is open to
none but foreigners, and out of the proceeds of the
traffic of these women a sacrifice to Aphrodite is
paid,<ref n="14"/>

<note n="14"><p>A custom of similar character commonly attached
itself to the worship of the Great Mother in her various
forms (cf. Herod. i. 199; Strabo, xv. i. 20), being regarded
as an honourable devotion to her service (Strabo, xi. xiv.
16); it was obligatory in Lydia (Herodotus, i. 93). Cf.,

Fortnightly Review, Dec., 1904, p. 985. For the survival
of the custom on old Hittite sites, cf. Strabo, xii. iii.
32, 34, 36; ibid. ii. 3, etc.). Belin de Ballu, Oeuvres de
Lucien, v. p. 141, n. I, cites a similar custom obli-
gatory before marriage (Chez les Angiles, peuples d’Afrique,

the comprehensive review of the question by Farnell,
Greece and Babylon, p. 269 ff, and the valuable résumé
by Cumont in his Religions Orientales, p. 359, n. 41. The
significance of the connection with a stranger as a relic
of exogamy is discussed by Perrot and Chipiez, Histoire

<head>Legend of Osiris at Byblos</head>
<p>
Some of the inhabitants of Byblos maintain that
the Egyptian Osiris is buried in their town, and that
the public mourning and secret rites are performed in
memory not of Adonis, but of Osiris.<ref n="15"/> I will tell you
why this story seems worthy of credence. A human
head comes every year from Egypt to Byblos,<ref n="16"/> floating
on its seven days’ journey thence: the winds, by some
divine instinct, waft it on its way: it never varies from
its course but goes straight to Byblos. The whole
occurrence is miraculous. It occurs every year, and
it came to pass while I was myself in Byblos, and I
saw the head in that city.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="8">
<head>The Adonis River; its red colour</head>
<p>
There is, too, another marvellous portent in the
region of the Byblians. A river, flowing from Mount
Libanus, discharges itself into the sea: this river bears
the name of Adonis.<ref n="17"/> Every year regularly it is tinged



<note n="15"><p>The apparent identity is discussed by Frazer, Adonis,
Aitis, and Osiris, pp. 357, etc. Prof. Newberry tells us
that there are instructive points of relationship traceable
in the early evidences of the Cult of Osiris in Egypt. The
familiar conception of Osiris, however, as King of the Dead,
is, in our opinion, traceable to ancestor- and king-worship.</p></note>

<note n="16"><p>Cf. Plutarch, Isis et Osiris, pp. 12-20 et seg. The
legend is rendered by Frazer, op. cit., pp. 270-273.</p></note>

with blood, and loses its proper colour before it falls
into the sea: it dyes the sea, to a large space, red:<ref n="18"/> and
thus announces their time of mourning to the Byblians.
Their story is that during these days Adonis is wounded,
and that the river’s nature is changed by the blood which
flows into its waters; and that it takes its name from
this blood. Such is the legend vulgarly accepted: but
a man of Byblos, who seemed to me to be telling the
truth, told me another reason for this marvellous change.
He spoke: as follows: “This river, my friend and
guest, passes through the Libanus: now this Libanus
abounds in red earth. The violent winds which blow
regularly on those days bring down into the river a
quantity of earth resembling vermilion. It is this earth
that turns the river to red. And thus the change in the
river’s colour is due, not to blood as they affirm, but to
the nature of the soil.”<ref n="19"/> This was the story of the
Byblian. But even assuming that he spoke the truth,
yet there certainly seems to me something supernatural
in the regular coincidence of the wind and the colouring
of the river.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="9">
<head>Cult of Aphrodite in the Lebanon at Aphaca</head>
<p>
I went up also from Byblos into the Libanus, a
single day’s journey, as I had heard that there was an
ancient temple of Aphrodite there founded by Cinyras.



<note n="18"><p>Cf. Maundrell, Journey from Aleppo to Jerusalem,
(1699, 6th edit., p. 35), March 17: “The water was stained
to a surprising redness, and as we observed in travelling,
had discoloured the sea a great way into a reddish hue,
occasioned doubtless by a sort of minium, or red earth,
washed into the river by the violence of the rain.”</p></note>

<note n="19"><p>This is the correct explanation.</p></note>

<pb n="49"/>




I saw the temple,<ref n="20"/> and it was indeed old. These then are

the ancient great temples of Syria.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="10">
	<head>Hierapolis: The greatest Sanctuary. Its Pilgrims</head>
    <p>
Of all these temples, and they are numerous indeed,
none seems to me greater than those found in the sacred
city; no shrine seems to me more holy, no region more
hallowed. They possess some splendid masterpieces,
some venerable offerings, many rare sights, many striking
statues, and the gods make their presence felt in no
doubtful way. The statues sweat, and move, and utter
oracles, and a shout has often been raised when the
temple was closed; it has been heard by many. And
more: this temple is the principal source of their wealth,
as I can vouch. For much money comes to them from
Arabia, and from the  Phoenicians and the Babylonians:
the Cilicians, too, and the Assyrians bring their tribute.<ref n="21"/>
And I saw with my own eyes treasures stored away
privately in the temple; many garments, and other
valuables, which are exchanged for silver or gold. No-
where among mankind are so many festivals and sacred
assemblies instituted as among them.


<note n="20"><p>Probably at Aphaca, now Afka, near the source of the
Nahr Ibrahim, where the cult was maintained until the time
of Constantine, who destroyed the shrine owing to the
licentious nature of the orgies in vogue (Eusebius, Vita
Constantina, iii. 55). At the present day little survives of
the ancient buildings except some Roman ruins.</p></note>

<note n="21"><p>This widespread tribute to the shrine of Hierapolis at
once reveals the Dea Syria as an aspect of the Great Mother,
who under various names was worshipped in the several
countries mentioned by Lucian, namely, in Arabia as ‘Athtar
[a male equivalent, vide Robertson-Smith, Relig. Semites,
p. 58], in Phoenicia as ‘Astart (Ashtoreth), in Babylonia and
Assyria (in varying characters) as Ishtar. Hierapolis, with
its hordes of pilgrims, its living worship and frenzied
ceremonies, must have been like the Mecca of to-day.</p></note>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="11"><p>
On enquiring the number of years since the temple
was founded, and whom they deemed the goddess to be,
many tales were told to me, Some of which were sacred,
and some public property; some, again, were absolutely
fabulous; others were mere barbarians’ tales; others
again tallied with the Greek accounts. All these I am
ready to narrate, though I withhold my acceptance of
some.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="12">
<head>Ascribed by some to Deukalion. Story of the Deluge</head>
<p>
The people, then, allege that it was Deukalion or
Sisythus who founded the temple; I mean the Deukalion
in whose time the great flood occurred. I have heard
the story about Deukalion as the Greeks narrate it from
the Greeks themselves. The story runsas follows: The
present race of men was not the first to be created. The
first generation perished to a man; the present is a
second creation. This generation became a vast multi-
tude, owing to Deukalion. Of the men of the original
creation they tell this tale: they were rebellious, and
wilful, and performed unholy deeds, disregarding the
sanctity of oaths and hospitality, and behaving cruelly
to suppliants; and it was for these misdeeds that the
great destruction fell upon them. Straightway the earth
discharged a vast volume of water, and the rivers of
heaven came down in streams and the sea mounted high.
Thus everything became water, and all men perished;
Deukalion alone was saved for another generation, on
the score of his wisdom and piety. The manner of his
salvation was as follows: He placed his children and
his wives in an ark of vast size, and he himself also
entered in. Now, when he had embarked, there came to
him wild boars and horses, and generations of lions and
serpents, and all the other beasts which roam the earth,
all in couples. He welcomed them all. Nor did they
harm him; and friendship remained amongst them as





<pb n="51"/>




Zeus himself ordained. These, one and all, floated in
this ark as long as the flood remained. This is the
legend of Deukalion as told by the Greeks.<ref n="22"/></p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="13">
<head>Story of the Chasm</head>
<p>
But a further story is told by the men of
Hierapolis, and a wonderful one it is; they say that
in their country a mighty chasm appeared which received
all the water, and that Deukalion on this occurrence reared
altars and founded a temple to Juno above this chasm.
I have actually seen this chasm, it lies beneath the
temple and is of very small dimensions. If it was once
of large size, and was afterwards reduced to its present
small dimensions, I know not: but the chasm which
I saw is certainly very small. They maintain that their
tale is proved by the following occurrence; twice in every
year the water comes from the sea to the temple. This
water is brought by the priests; but besides them, all
Syria and Arabia and many from beyond the Euphrates

<note n="22"><p>This version of the deluge, though associated by
Lucian’s Greek informants with Deucalion, is clearly of
eastern origin, having little resemblance to the Greek
legend, and much in common with the Babylonian versions,
viz., the story of Xisuthros, recorded by Berosus, and partly
preserved; the legend of Tsit-napishtim in the epic of Gil-
gamesh, preserved on seventh century tablets from the
library of Assurbanipal (and independently appearing on
tablets of a king of the first dynasty of Babylon, dating from
about 2100 B.c.); and lastly with the Biblical story of Noah
in Genesis. A fundamental difference is that in the Greek
legend only Deucalion and Pyrrha were saved, and man-
kind was subsequently renewed miraculously in response
to the oracle of Themis. Lucian’s account of the animals
coming in couples has its parallel in the Babylonian text:
“With all living seed of every kind I filled it, ... the
cattle of the field, and the beasts of the field, ... all of
them I brought in” (transl. by King, Babylonian
Religion, p. 132. g.v.).</p></note>

they first pour outin the temple;<ref n="23"/> then this water passes
down into the chasm which, small though it be, holds a
vast quantity of water. Thus then they act, and they
declare that the following law was passed by Deukalion
in that temple, in order that it might be an everlasting
remembrance at once of the visitation and of its
alleviation.</p></div>

<note n="25"><p>Derceto, identified with Atargatis by Pliny, Nat.
Hist. v. 19; indeed, the two names are linguistically
similar. That Atargatis was the name of the goddess wor-
shipped at Hierapolis is stated by Strabo (xvi. i. 27), and
confirmed by the local coins and other sources (see Intro-
duction, p. 21, and note 57). Atargatis, according to the
scholiast on Germanicus’ “Aratus,’” was of local origins,
being born in the Euphrates, like Aphrodite from the foam
of the sea. (Cf. Rob.-Smith, Relig. Semites, p. 175, and
notes on § 45 below.) The name Atargatis is a compound
of ‘ATHAR (Phoen. ‘Astart, Heb. ‘Ashtoreth) with ‘ATTI
or ‘ATTAH (vide Koenig in Hasting’s Abrig. Dict.,
p. 70 b); or in Aramaic ‘ATHAR and ‘ATHE (cf. Ed. Meyer,
Geschichte des Alierthums,i., isted., p. 246, § 205 ff). Frazer
(Adonis, etc., pp. 129, 130) points out that the com-
pound according to this derivation includes the name of
the Cilician goddess ‘Atheh, consort of Baal, as well as
that of Astarte or Ishtar, amounting thus to Ishtar-Atheh,
the latter being presumably a Cilician aspect of the former.
Thus far there is no difficulty; but_Pliny further describes
the goddess as “monstrous’ (prodigiosa), and his identi-
fication with Derceto suggests the familiar fish goddess of
Askalon. Moreover, travellers have seen local represen-
tations of the characteristic “mermaid” form (see note 26).
Yet in what follows Lucian is careful to distinguish Derceto
from the “Hera” of Hierapolis, who is seated on a lion-throne
(§ 31), and never assumes any fish-like or other monstrous
aspect on the local coins. (Cf. also Dussaud, in Rev. Archéo-
logique, 1904, lil. p. 258.) Assuming the identity of Atargatis
with Derceto to be correct, it is more consistent with
Lucian’s observations (§§ I, 14-16, 31, 32), and with the
argument developed in our Introduction, to see embodied
in Atargatis that local aspect of the great Nature-goddess 
that typified the productive powers of waters (in generating
fishes, etc.), and that in this capacity she was accorded at
Hierapolis a separate shrine and rites, which none the less
formed a part of the general worship of the Universal
Mother. It is interesting to speculate how all strains of
evidence would be reconciled and explained if it could be
shown that ‘“Atheh” was really a local fish-goddess. On
the whole question, see further Cumont, ‘“Dea Syria,” in
Pauly’s Real-Encyclopaddie (Wissowa), 1901, iv., col. 2236, ff.</p></note>

stone with three figures carved on it, in Basso Relievo.
They were two Syrens, which, twining their fishy tails
together, made a seat, on which was placed sitting a naked
woman, her arms and the Syrens on each side mutually
entwined” (Appendix, p. 91). This sculpture was appa-
rently seen also by Pocock, who describes it as a stone
about four feet long and three wide, on which there was a
relief of two winged persons holding a sheet behind a woman,
a little over her head; they seem tocarry her on their fishy
tails which join together, and were probably designed to
represent the Zephyrs, carrying Venus to the sea (quoted in
the Appendix, p. 93).</p>

<p>Other famous Syrian shrines of Derceto were at Carnion

a mermaid (Hastings, Abr. Dict., p. 70). On‘the general

sacred.<ref n="29"/> It appears to them then that what we have
described was done in honour of Derceto and Semiramis.
The former, because Derceto has the form of a fish; the
latter, because the lower half of Semiramis takes the form
of a pigeon. I, however, should probably conclude that
the temple in question belongs to Semiramis; that the
shrine is Derceto’s I can in no wise believe, since even
amongst the Egyptians there are some who will not
touch fish as food, and they certainly do not observe this
restriction in favour of Derceto.</p></div>

<head>Lucian shares the View that it was founded by Dionysus</head>
<p>
I approve of the remarks about the temple made
by those who in the main accept the theories of the
Greeks: according to these the goddess is Hera, but
the work was carriedout by Dionysus,<ref n="34"/> the son of Semele:
Dionysus visited Syria on his journey to Aethiopia.
There are in the temple many tokens that Dionysus
was its actual founder: for instance, barbaric raiment,
Indian precious stones, and elephants’ tusks brought
by Dionysus from the Aethiopians. Further, a pair of
phalli of great size are seen standing in the vestibule,
bearing the inscription, “I, Dionysus, dedicated these
phalli to Hera my stepmother.” This proof satisfies
me. And I will describe another curiosity to be found
in this temple, a sacred symbol of Dionysus. The
Greeks erect phalli in honour of Dionysus, and on
these they carry, singular to say, mannikins made of
wood, with enormous pudenda; they call these puppets.
There is this further curiosity in the temple: as you
enter, on the right hand, a small brazen statue meets
your eye of a man in a sitting posture, with parts of
monstrous size.

<head>Re-built by Stratonice</head>
<p>
These are the legends concerning the founders
of the temple. I will proceed to speak of the edifice
itself and its position: how it was built and who built
it. They affirm that the temple as it exists now is
not that which was built originally: the primitive temple
fell to pieces in the course of time: the present one
they say was the work of Stratonice, the wife of
the king of the Assyrians.<ref n="35"/> This I take to be the
Stratonice of whom her stepson was enamoured, and
the skill of a doctor detected the intrigue: for the
lover, overpowered by the malady of his passion,
bewildered by the thought of his shameful caprice, lay
sick in silence. He lay sick, and though no ache was
in any limb, yet his colour was gone, and his frame was
growing frailer day by day. The doctor, seeing that
he was suffering from no definite disease, perceived
that his malady was none other than love. Many
are the symptoms of secret love: languor of vision,
change in the voice and complexion, and frequent tears.

<note n="35"><p>The stories of Stratonice and of Combabus which follow,
§§ 17-25, are not of special interest. They seem to include
garbled local details from the legends of Istar and Tammuz,
and to be introduced as the fulfilment of Lucian’s wish to
explain the origin of emasculation and other customs among
the Galli (see end of § 15). None the less, Stratonice is a
recognisable historical character, wife of Seleucus Nicator
(of Antioch), at the close of the third century B.c., and
Movers (i., p. 687) has urged the identity of Combabus with
the god of Hierapolis. On the resemblance of the name
to the Elamite Khumbaba, cf. Ungnad, D. Gilgamesch-Epos,
Pp. 77,n. For this reference we are indebted to Professor
Lehmann-Haupt. Six (Num. Chron., 1878, p. 117)
explains the main feature of Lucian’s story in these
words: “... la reine se fit initier aux actes religieux;
et prit part aux cérémonies que célébraient les Syriens en
l’honneur de leur déesse.”</p></note>

<pb n="59"/>




The doctor, aware of this, acted as follows: hel aid his
hand on the heart of the young man, and summoned
all the domestics in the household. The patient
remained tranquil and unmoved on the entrance of
the rest, but when his stepmother came in he grew
pale and fell to sweating and trembling, and his heart
beat violently. These symptoms betrayed his passion
to the doctor.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="18"><p>
The doctor proceeded to adopt the following cure:
Summoning the young man’s father, who was racked by
anxiety, he explained to him that the young man’s
malady was no normal malady, but a wrongful action:
‘he has no painful symptoms; he is possessed by love
and madness. He longs to possess what he will never
obtain; he loves my wife, whom I will never give up.”
This was the trick of the wise physician. The father
straightway begged the doctor by his prudence and pro-
fessional skill not to let his son perish. ‘His malady
depended not on his will; it was involuntary. Pray
then do not you let your jealousy bring grief on the
whole realm, and do not, dear doctor, draw unpopularity
on your profession.” Such was the unwitting father’s
request. The doctor replied: “Your request is scanda-
lous. You would deprive me of my wife and outrage
the honour of a medical man. I put it to you, what
would be your conduct, since you are deprecating mine,
if your wife were the object of his guilty love?” He
replied that he would not spare his own wife nor would
he begrudge his son his life, even though that son were
enamoured of his own stepmother: losing one’s wife was
a less misfortune than losing one’s son. The doctor on
hearing this said: ‘* Why then offer me these entreaties?
In good truth, your wife is the object of his love. What
I said to you was all a made-up story.” The father





<pb n="60"/>





followed this advice, and handed over his wife and his
kingdom to his son, and he himself departed into the
region of Babylonia and founded a city on the Euphrates
which bore his name: and there he died. Thus it was
that our wise doctor detected and cured the malady.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="19">
<head>Story oi Stratonice and Combabus</head>
<p>
Now this Stratonice, when still married to her
former husband, saw in a vision Hera exhorting her to
rear a temple to this goddess at Hierapolis. Should she
neglect to obey, she was menaced by the goddess with
manifold evils. The queen began by disregarding the
dream, but later, when seized by a dangerous illness, she
told the vision to her husband, and appeased Hera, and
undertook toraise the temple. Hardly had she recovered
when she was despatched by her husband to Hierapolis,
and a large sum of money with her, and a large army
too, partly to aid in the building operations and partly to
ensure her safety. He summoned one of her friends
called Combabus, a young man of handsome presence,
and said, “Combabus, I know thee for an honest man,
and of all my friends I love thee best, and I commend
thee greatly alike for thy wisdom and for thy goodwill
which thou hast shown to us. At the present moment J
have need of all thy confidence, and thus I wish thee to
accompany my wife, and to carry out my work, and to
perform the sacrifices due, and to command my army.
On my return great honour shall fall to thee. Combabus
begged and prayed not to be despatched, and not to be
entrusted with matters far above his powers—moneys,
the lady, the holy work: not merely so, but he feared
lest in the future some jealousy might make itself felt
as to his relations with Stratonice, as he was unaccom-
panied should he consent to escort her.

</p></div>


<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="20">
<p>The king, however, refused to be moved; so
Combabus prayed as an alternative that a respite of



<pb n="61"/>




seven days might be granted him: after that interval he
was willing to be despatched after attending to his
immediate needs. On obtaining this respite, which was
willingly granted, he departed to his house, and throwing
himself on the ground, he thus deplored his lot:
“Unhappy me! Why this confidence in myself? To
what end is this journey, whose results I already see?
I am young and the lady whom I escort is fair. This
will prove a great and mighty disaster, unless I remove
entirely the cause of the evil. Thus I must even
perform a mighty deed which will heal all my fears.”
Saying this he unmanned himself, and he stowed away
the mutilated pudenda in a little vessel together with
myrrh and honey and spices of various sorts. He sealed
this vessel up with a ring which he wore; and finally he
proceeded to dress his wound. As soon as he deemed
himself fit to travel he made his way to the king, and
before a large company reached the vessel forth and
spoke as follows: “Master! This my most precious
treasure was stored up in my house, and I loved it
well: but now that Iam entering on a long journey, I
will set itin thy keeping. Do thou keep it well: for it is
dearer to me than gold and more precious to me than
life. On my return I shall receive it again.” The king
was pleased to receive the vessel, and after sealing it
with another seal he entrusted it to his treasurers to
keep.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="21"><p>
So Combabus from this time forth continued his
journey in peace. Arrived at Hierapolis they built the
temple with all diligence, and three years passed while
they were at their task. Meantime the event came to
pass which Combabus had feared. Stratonice began to
love him who had been her companion for so longa time:
her love passed into an overpowering passion. Those of





<pb n="62"/>




Hierapolis affirm that Hera was the willing cause of this
trouble: she knew full well that Combabus was an
upright man, but she wished to wreak her wrath on
Stratonice for her unwillingness to undertake the building
of the temple.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="22"><p>
The queen was at first coy and tried to hide her
passion, but when her trouble left her no longer any
repose, she openly displayed her irritation and wept the
whole day long, and called out repeatedly for Combabus:
Combabus was everything to her. At last, in despair at
her impotency to master her passion, she sought a
suitable occasion for supplicating his love. She was too
cautious to admit her passion to a stranger, but her
modesty prevented her from facing the situation. Finally
she hits on this plan; that she should confront him after
she should have drunk deeply of wine; for courage rises
after drinking and a repulse seems then less degrading,
and actions performed under the influence of wine are set
down to ignorance. Thus she acted as she thought best.
After supper she entered the chamber in which Combabus
dwelt, and besought him, embracing his knees, and she
avowed her guilty love. He heard her words with
disgust and rejected her advances, reproaching her with
drunkenness. She, however, threatened that she would
bring on him a great calamity; on which he trembled, and
he told her all his story and narrated all that he had
done and finally disclosed to her the manifest proofs
of his statement. When the queen witnessed this
unexpected proof her passion indeed was quenched, but
she never forgot her love, but in all her intercourse she
cherished the solace of her unavailing affection. The
memory of this love is still alive at Hierapolis and is
maintained in this way; the women still are enamoured
of the Galli, and the Galli again love the women with



<pb n="63"/>




passion; but there is no jealousy at all, and this love
passes among them for a holy passion.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="23"><p>
The king was well informed by Stratonice as to
her doings at Hierapolis, for many who came thence
brought the tale of her doings. The monarch was deeply
moved by the tidings, and before the work was finished
summoned Combabus to his presence. Others narrate
with respect to this a circumstance wholly untrue; that
Stratonice finding her prayers repulsed wrote with her
own hand to her husband and accused Combabus of
making an attempt upon her modesty; and what the
Greeks allege about their Stheneboea and about
Phaedra the Cnosian the Assyrians tell in the same way
about Stratonice. For my part I do not believe that
either Stheneboea nor Phaedra acted thus if Phaedra
really loved Hippolytus. However, let the old version
remain for what it is worth.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="24"><p>
When, however, the news was brought to
Hierapolis, Combabus took count of the charge and
departed in a spirit of full confidence, conscious that
the visible proof necessary for his defence had been left
in the city his home. On his arrival the king imme-
diately put him in prison under strict guard. Then in
the presence of the friends of the accused who had been
present when Combabus was commissioned to depart,
the king summoned him into open court and began to
accuse him of adultery and evil lust; and deeply moved,
recounting the confidence he had reposed in his favourite
and his long friendship, he arraigned Combabus on three
distinct charges: first, that he was an adulterer, secondly,
that he had broken his trust, finally, that he had blas-
phemed the goddess by acting thus while engaged in her
service. Many of the bystanders bore witness against
him, saying that they had seen the guilty pair embracing.





<pb n="64"/>




It was finally agreed that Combabus was worthy of
death as his evil deeds had merited.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="25"><p>
He had stood up to this point in silence, but as
he was being led to his fate, he spoke out, and
demanded the restoration of his pledge, affirming that he
was to be killed not for rebellious conduct against his
king, nor for any violation of the king’s married life, but
solely because of the king’s eagerness to possess what he
had deposited at the royal court at his departure. The
king thereon summoned his treasurer and bade him bring
forth what he had committed to his custody. On its
production, Combabus removed the seal and displayed
the contents of the vessel, and showed how he himself
had suffered thereby; adding, “This is just what I
feared, O King, when thou didst send me on that
errand: I left with a heavy heart, and I did my duty,
constrained by sheer necessity. I obeyed my lord and
master to mine own undoing. Such as I am, I stand
accused of a crime which none but a man in every sense
could have committed. The king cried out in amaze-
ment at these words, embraced Combabus and said with
tears, “What great ruin, Combabus, hast thou wrought
upon thyself? What monstrous deed of ill hast thou,
alone of men, wrought to thy sorrow? I cannot praise
thee, rash spirit, for enduring to suffer this outrage;
would that thou hadst never borne it; would that I had
never seen its proofs! I needed not this thy defence.
But since the deity hath willed it thus, I will grant
thee, first and foremost, as thy revenge, the death of the
informers: and next there shall follow a mighty gift, a
store of silver and countless gold, and raiment ‘of
Assyria, and steeds from the royal stud. Thou shalt
enter freely to us unannounced and none shall with-
stand thee: none shall keep thee from my sight, even





<pb n="65"/>




were I by my wife’s side.” Thus he spake, and thus he
acted; the informers were led off straightway to their
execution; Combabus was laden with gifts, and the
king’s attachment to him was increased. No one of the
Assyrians was deemed equal in wisdom and in fortune
to Combabus.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="26"><p>
On his request that he might complete what was
unfinished in the construction of the temple—for he had
left it unfinished—he was despatched anew; and he
completed the temple, and there he abode. To mark
his sense of the virtue and good deeds of his architect,
the king granted him a brazen statue of himself to
stand in the temple of his construction. And even
to the present day this brazen statue is seen standing
in the temple, the work of Hermocles of Rhodes. Its
form is that of a woman, but the garments are those of a
man.<ref n="36"/> It is said, too, that his most intimate friends, as
a proof of their sympathy, castrated themselves like him,
and chose the same manner of life. Others there are
who bring gods into the story and affirm that Combabus
was beloved by Hera; and that it was she who inspired
many with the idea of castrating themselves, so that her
lover should not be the only one to lament the loss
of his virility.;</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="27"><p>
Meantime the custom once adopted remains even
to-day, and many persons every year castrate themselves
and lose their virile powers: whether it be out of
sympathy with Combabus, or to find favour with Hera.
They certainly castrate themselves, and then cease to
wear man’s garb; they don women’s raiment and perform

and elsewhere on the dress of the Galli to believe that this
brazen statue really represented Combabus. His description

<pb n="66"/>




women’s tasks.<ref n="37"/> I have heard the origin of this ascribed
to Combabus as well, for the following event occurred to
him. A certain foreign woman who had joined a sacred
assembly, beholding a human form of extreme beauty
and dressed in man’s attire, became violently enamoured
of him: after discovering that he was unsexed, she took
away her life. Combabus accordingly in despair at his
incapacity for love, donned woman’s attire, that no
woman in future might be deceived in the same way.
This is the reason of the female attire of the Galli.
Enough of Combabus and his story: in the course of my
story I shall make mention of the Galli, and of their
castration; and of the methods employed to effect it, and
of the burial rites wherewith they are buried, and the
reasons why they have no ingress to the temple; but
before this I am inclined to speak of the site of the
temple and of its size: and so I will even speak.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="28"><p>
The place whereon the temple is placed is a hill:<ref n="38"/>
it lies nearly in the centre of the city, and is surrounded
by a double wall.<ref n="39"/> Of the two walls the one is ancient;



<note n="37"><p>Cf. § 15 and, especially, § 51 below.</p></note>

<note n="38"><p>The exact position is now a matter of doubt (see the
extracts in the Appendix (p. 94) and Hogarth in Jour.
Hell. Stud., xiv. p. 189). Pocock says: “About two
hundred paces within the east gate there is raised ground,
on which probably stood a temple of the Syrian goddess
Atargatis. . . . I conjectured it to be about 200 feet in
front. . . . I observed a low wall running from it to the
gate... (cf. note 42,§ 29). Itis probable that all the space
north of the temple belonged to it.”</p></note>
<note n="39"><p>So the wall surrounding the royal Syro-Hittite city of
Senjerli was doubled (Von Luschan and others, Ausgr. in
Sendschirli, Berlin, 1893, etc.); likewise that of the Hittite
township on Songrus Eyuk at Sakje Geuzi (Liv. Annals of
Arch. v. 65). No traces of the original walls of Hierapolis
remain: those described by our earliest travellers seem to be
of Byzantine type. [See Appendix, pp. 91, 93, 96.]</p></note>

the other is not much older than our own times, The
entrance to the temple faces the north; its sizeis abouta
hundred fathoms.<ref n="40"/> In this entrance those phalli stand
which Dionysus erected:<ref n="41"/> they stand thirty fathoms high.



<note n="40"><p>The ὄργυια = 4 πήχεις, i.e., 6 feet 1 inch. There is some
general correspondence between the details supplied by
Lucian and by Pocock. If the latter rightly judged the
position we may infer that the temple was 600 feet in length,
with a frontage of about 200 feet.</p></note>

<note n="41"><p>Above, § 16. Similarly twin pillars were erected in the
temple of Hercules at Tyre (Herodotus, ii. 44), and in the
temple of Solomon at Jerusalem (1 Kings, vii. 15, 21),
“eighteen cubits high apiece right and left of the porch.”
At Paphos it would appear from the coins that single pillars
stood in the side chapels as well as the twin pillars and cone
in the sanctuary. Gold models from Mykenz show pairs of
horns at the base and top of such pillars (Schuchhardt,
Schliemann’s Excavations, p. 199, fig. 183), suggesting
emblems of generative power, and hence in this sense a
phallic motive. On top of the horns is the dove, the emblem
of the Goddess Mother. The question of original motive,
however, is controversial. Cf. Evans, “Mykenzan Tree
and Pillar Cult” (Jour. Hell. Stud., 1907, pp. 99-203);
Ramsay, “Relig. of Asia Minor,” in Hastings’ Dict.
Bible, extra vol., p. 111; and the phallic character is
disputed by Rob.-Smith, Relig. Sem., p. 457. For the
pillar cult in Asia Minor, see Ramsay, Joc. cit. The pillar
does not appear on Hittite mural decoration; but there is
a remarkable monument at Fassiler, in Asia Minor, nearly 8 yards high, the width narrowing from 3 yards at the
bottom to 1 yard at the top. Upon the base is carved
a group showing a great figure upon two lions, with a smaller
figure between the latter. The design has obvious Hittite
characteristics, but the execution is crude (Ramsay, Cities
of St. Paul, p. 134, fig. 7; L. H. pp. 175-176).</p>

<p>This class of emblem is to be distinguished from the sacred
cones of the goddess in Syria and Asia Minor, such as are
found at Mallus, Perga, Byblus, etc., cf. Fig. 6, p. 45.</p></note>

Into one of these a man mounts twice every year, and
he abides on the summit of the phallus for the space
of seven days. The reason of this ascent is given
as follows: The people believe that the man who
is aloft holds converse with the gods, and prays for
good fortune for the whole of Syria, and that the gods
from their neighbourhood hear his prayers. Others
allege that this takes place in memory of the great
calamity of Deukalion’s time, when men climbed up
to mountain tops and to the highest trees, in terror of the
mass of waters. To me all this seems highly improbable,
and I think that they observe this custom in honour of
Dionysus, and I conjecture this from the following fact,
that all those who rear phalli to Dionysus take care to
place mannikins of wood on the phalli; the reason of
this I cannot say, but it seems to me that the ascent is
made in imitation of the wooden mannikin.

</p></div>


<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="29">
<p>To proceed, the ascent is made in this way; the
man throws round himself and the phallus a small
chain; afterwards he climbs up by means of pieces of
wood attached to the phallus large enough to admit the
end of his foot. As he mounts he jerks the chain up his
own length, as a driver his reins. Those who have not
seen this process, but who have seen those who have to
climb palm trees in Arabia, or in Egypt, or any other
place, will understand what I mean. When he has
climbed to the top, he lets down a different chain, a long
one, and drags up anything that he wants, such as wood,
clothing, and vases; he binds these together and sits
upon them, as it were, on a nest, and he remains there
for the space of time that I have mentioned. Many

visitors bring him gold and silver, and some bring brass;
then those who have brought these offerings leave them
and depart, and each visitor gives hisname. A bystander
shouts the name up; and he on hearing the name utters
a prayer for each donor; between the prayers he raises a
sound on a brazen instrument which, on being shaken,
gives forth a loud and grating noise. He never sleeps;
for if at any time sleep surprises him, a scorpion
creeps up and wakes him, and stings him severely;
this is the penalty for wrongfully sleeping. This
story about the scorpion is a sacred one, and one of
the mysteries of religion; whether it is true I cannot
say, but, as it seems to me, his wakefulness is in no small
degree due to his fear of falling. So much then for the
climbers of the phalli. As for the temple, it looks to the
rising sun.<ref n="42"/></p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="30"><p>
In appearance, and in workmanship, it is like the
temples which they build in Ionia, the foundation rises
from the earth to the space of two fathoms, and on this
rests the temple. The ascent to the temple is built of
wood and not particularly wide; as You mount, even the
great hall exhibits a wonderful spectacle and it is
ornamented with golden doors. The temple within is
ablaze with gold and the ceiling in its entirety is golden.
There falls upon you also a divine fragrance such as is
attributed to the region of Arabia, which breathes on you
with a refreshing influence as you mount the long steps,
and even when you have departed this fragrance clings
to you; nay, your very raiment retains long that sweet
odour, and it will ever remain in your memory.

sacred shrine is reared within it; the ascent to this like-
wise is not steep, nor is it fitted with doors, but is
entirely open as you approach it. The great temple is
open to ail; the sacred shrine to the priests alone and
not to all even of these, but only to those who are deemed
nearest to the gods and who have the charge of the
entire administration of the sacred rites. In this shrine
are placed the statues, one of which is Hera, the other
Zeus, though they call him by another name. Both of
these are golden, both are sitting; Hera is supported by
lions, Zeus is sitting on bulls. The effigy of Zeus recalls
Zeus in all its details—his head, his robes, his throne;
nor even if you wished it could you take him for another
deity.<ref n="43"/>

<note n="43"><p>See the design upon the remarkably instructive coin
now at Vienna, reproduced in Fig. 7. On the identification
of “Hera,” the lion goddess, and ‘“Zeus,” the bull-god, in
the Hittite pantheon, see Introduction, pp. 8 ff., and
Figs. 2, 3, 4. Macrobius speaks of them as “Hadad” and
‘“* Atargatis,’””» names confirmed by inscriptions found at
Delos (see p. 25). Lucian’s description of the sanctuary,
with its common shrine of “Hera” and “Zeus,’” and the
details by which he distinguishes these deities, form the
basis of our argument in the Introduction (pp. 11, 23, 27),
that this god and goddess are identical with the chief Hittite
male and female deities, who are “mated” in the sculp-
tures at Yasily Kaya. The historical inference is that
the origins of the temple date from the period of Hittite
supremacy; and this conclusion is in seeming agreement with
what Lucian says in § 17 of the antiquity of the original
temple. Subsequently, as the Hittite power declined,
their god lost predominance, and the cult of the Mother
Goddess developed its local tendencies. The rites and
institutions in the worship at Hierapolis which Lucian now
proceeds to describe are naturally those of his own time,
but here and there (as in §§ 44, 47) traces of the original dual
nature of the cult may be detected.

<head>Object between the God and Goddess</head>
<p>
Between the two there stands another image of
gold, no part of it resembling the others. This possesses
no special form of its own, but recalls the characteristics
of other gods. The Assyrians themselves speak of it as
aga symbol, but they have assigned to it no definite
name. They have nothing to tell us about its origin, nor
its form: some refer it to Dionysus; others to Deukalion;
others to Semiramis; for its summit is crowned by a
golden pigeon,<ref n="45"/> and this is why they allege that it is
the effigy of Semiramis. It is taken down to the sea
twice in every year to bring up the water of which I have
spoken.<ref n="46"/>

<note n="45"><p>This object, “with characteristics of the other gods,”
etc., is hardly explained by the later structure of Roman
character which appears upon the coin of the third cen-
tury A.D. (cf. Fig. 7, and p. 23); butin sculptures at Fraktin
in Southern Asia Minor (L. H., xlvii.) there are two groups.
In the one there is a shrine and image of a god, whom a
walrior-priest seems to be worshipping. In the other
the Great Mother is enthroned, with a priestess pouring
out an oblation before her. In each case between the
deity and the worshipper there rises a special form of altar,
with pedestal and flat round top (see Fig. 4, p. 24). The
pedestal takes the form of a human body, from waist down-
wards, being swathed by many cross folds of a fringed cloth
or garment. Upon the top is perched a dove or pigeon.
The bird appears similarly placed on a similar altar
at Yarre (Crowfoot, Jour. Hell. Stud. xix., 1899, fig. 4:
pp. 40-45). The altar is shown conventionally at Eyuk
(see Fig. 3). For the dove in Hittite symbolism, see

<head>The Sun God</head>
<p>
In the body of the temple, as you enter, there
stands on the left hand side, a throne for the Sun god;
but there is no image upon it, for the effigies of the Sun
and Moon are not exhibited. I have learnt, however,
the reasons of this practice. They say that religion does
not forbid making effigies of the other deities, for the
outward form of these deities is known to all; but the
Sun and Moon are plain for all to see, and all men
behold them. What boots it, therefore, to make effigies
of those deities who offer themselves for all to gaze on?</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="35">
<head>A Bearded Apollo</head>
<p>
Behind this throne stands an effigy of Apollo of
an unusual character. All other sculptors think of
Apollo as a youth, and represent him in the flower
of his age. These artificers alone exhibit the Apollo
of their statuary as bearded. They justify their action,
and criticise the Greeks and others who set up Apollo as
a boy, and appease him in that guise. Their reason is
that it is a mark of ignorance to assign imperfect forms
to the gods, and they look on youth as imperfection.
They have also introduced another strange novelty in
sculpture: they, and they alone, represent Apollo as
robed.<ref n="47"/>

<note n="47"><p>It may reasonably be suspected that the empty
throne for the sun-god (§ 34) was in reality an altar to this
“bearded and robed Apollo.’” It is also clear that Lucian
regards this form of the god as native; and it is of interest
to consider what Oriental or Syrian deity is indicated, and
for what reasons he became. identified in the Greek mind
with Apollo.</p>

<p>In the first place it is important to recall a passage from
Macrobius, which amplifies Lucian’s account and seems to
confirm our surmise. In the Saturnala (I. xvii. §§ 66,
67) he says: “The Hierapolitans, a Syrian people, assign
all the powers and attributes of the sun to a bearded image
which they call Apollo. His face is represented with a long
pointed beard, and he wears a calathos on his head. His
body is protected with a breastplate. In his right hand he
holds upright a spear, on the top of which is a small image
of Victory; in his left is something like a flower.
From the top of his shoulders there hangs down behind
a cloak bordered with serpents. ... Near him are
eagles, represented as in flight: at his feet is the image
of a woman, with two other female forms right and left;
a dragon enfolds them with his coils.’ With the last
sentence of this extract we are not concerned: it possibly
refers to features of the shrine added since Lucian’s days.
We are left then with the conception of a native solar
divinity, bearded and robed, and identified on general
grounds with Apollo. Why, then, with Apollo?</p>

<p>The beard presents no difficulty, for in early art the Greek
Apollo was frequently represented with this feature (e.g., see
Farnell, Cults, figs. xvii. and xxiii. and p. 329). In myth
Apollo was twin-brother of Artemis; and in the Iliad he
was definitely allied with the Trojans. Further, the
attribute Atos OF Adxews Suggests to some scholars an
origin in Lycia; while others derive him from the East
or from Egypt. However that may be, most scholars are
agreed that some aspects of the god are associated with
primitive Nature-worship, and there is a general suspicion
of an Oriental or Asiatic element in his cult. (See especi-
ally the Oxford lectures of Wilamowitz, 1908, ‘* Apollo,”
p. 30 ff.) This conclusion seems to be supported by the
character and seasons of his festivals in Greece. In
particular, the Theophania at Delphi, celebrating the return
of the sun at springtime, and the wvavéyie at Athens, the
harvest-thanksgiving, while natural to any pastoral country,
are particularly apposite to the worship of the Great Mother.
(For similar festivals in Hittite rites, cf. L. H., pp. 239, 359).
Indeed, in § 49, Lucian describes a great festival of the
springtime, at which noticeably goats, sheep and cattle
were sacrificed; and horses are included in the list of sacred
animals in § 41.</p>
<p>There are, then, elements in the Cult of Apollo that had
long been familiar to the nature-worshippers of Northern
Syria and Asia Minor. The object suggesting a flower
(floris species) in the hand of this god indicates, as
Macrobius says, a god of vegetation; and possibly it
replaced something more definitive, like ears of corn.
The calathos we have seen already (note 33) to reflect
the ancient conical hat of the Hittite age, and the spear
is found in the hand of the warrior-god of Karabel,
and in other examples of Hittite art (L. H., pl. Ixxv.).
Now the local deity who most nearly combined these
various attributes would be Sandan (or Sandes), who is
figured on the Hittite sculpture of Ivriz (L. H., pl. Ivii.) as
a god of agriculture, with corn and grapes; he is bearded
and wears the Hittite dressand hat. There he was identified
by the Greeks with Hercules. Professor Frazer has shown
(op. cit., pp. 110, 151 ff.) that Sandan bore to Baal much
the same relation as the Hittite “Atys ’” to their “Zeus.” -
But the youthful god, after the fall of the Hatti and their
chief god, seems to have filled in the popular mind the place
of the father god also, and to have become more and more
identified with him (cf. Frazer, op. cit., p. 236; L. H.,
p. 360), like Atys with Zeus (Farnell, Cults, i., pp. 36, 37).
In this way our Sandan-Atys might come to be regarded
quite naturally as a sun-god (like Hadad-Zeus); and
hence we should obtain a reasonable explanation for the
identification of this deity with Apollo.</p></note>

speak of the oracle. There are many oracles among the
Greeks, and many, too, among the Egyptians, and again
in Libya and in Asia there are many too. But these
speak not, save by the mouth of priests and prophets:
this one is moved by its own impulse, and carries out the
divining process to the very end. The manner of his
divination is the following: When he is desirous of
uttering an oracle, he first stirs in his seat, and the priests
straightway raise him up. Should they fail to raise him
up, he sweats, and moves more violently than ever.







<pb n="77"/>




When they approach him and bear him up,<ref n="48"/> he drives
them round in a circle, and leaps on one after another.
At last the high priest confronts him, and questions him
on every subject. The god, if he disapproves of any
action proposed, retreats into the background; if, how-
ever, he happens to approve it, he drives his bearers
forward as if they were horses. It is thus that they
gather the oracles, and they undertake nothing public or
private without this preliminary. This god, too, speaks
about the symbol, and points out when it is the due season

his priests in the Hittite sanctuary near Boghaz-Keui (L. H.,

custom at Comana (Pontus) at the Exodi of the Goddess,
also (xv. iii. 15) in the worship by the Persian settlers of
Omanus at Zela in Cappadocia. So, too, the statue of
Hadad in Assyria is shown borne by his priests on a re-
presentation from Nineveh (Layard, Nineveh, ii-, 1849,

It contains also countless other brazen effigies of kings
and priests. I will mention those which seem most
worthy of remembrance. To the left of the temple
stands the image of Semiramis, pointing with her right
hand to the temple. That image was erected to com-
memorate the following occurrence: The queen had
issued a decree that all the Syrians should worship
her as a deity, adding that they were to take no count
of the others, not excepting even Hera; and they obeyed
her decree. Afterwards, however, when disease and mis-
fortune and grief were inflicted on her, she calmed down
from her frenzied infatuation, and avowed herself a
mere mortal, and ordered her subjects to turn again to
Hera. This is why she stands to-day in this posture,
pointing out Hera as the goddess whose grace is to be
won, and confessing that she is not a goddess, but that
Hera is indeed such.</p></div>

lions. An inscription of Boghaz-Keui refers to a “house”
or “temple of the eagle’” (Jour. R. A. S., 1909, p. 971).
This bird would naturally seem to be an appropriate
emblem of Zeus-Hadad, but there is nothing to substantiate
this probability. The horse appears on Hittite sculptures
only in an ordinary capacity; but in Anatolia in general
developed sacred attributes. (Cf. Ramsay, ‘Relig. of Asia

<head>The Sacrifices</head>
<p>
A sacrifice is offered up twice every day, and they
are all present at this. To Zeus they sacrifice in silence,
neither chanting nor playing, but when they sacrifice to
Hera they sing, they pipe, and shake rattles. About
this ceremony they could tell me nothing certain.<ref n="54"/></p></div>

<head>Sacred Lake and Fishes</head>
<p>
There is too a lake<ref n="55"/> in the same place, not far



<note n="54"><p>Notwithstanding the differences of ritual, the asso-
ciation of “Zeus” and “Hera” together in this paragraph
is again significant of the original dual character of the cult.</p></note>

<note n="55"><p>The sacred lake is still conspicuous. Cf. Maundrell,
op. cit. p. 154: “On the west side is a deep pit, of about
Ioo yards diameter; it... seemed to have had great
buildings all round it, with the pillars and ruins of which it
is now almost filled up, . . . but... there was still water
in it.” Chesney, Exped. Euphrat. i. 516: “a rocky
hollow.’” Hogarth (Jour. Hell. Stud. xiv. p. 187) describes
also “the scanty remains of a stepped quay wall or revet-
ment, with water stairs at intervals.”</p>

<p>The Hittite river-gods are invoked in witness of their
treaty with Egypt (c. 1271 B.C.). Cf. also Ramsay, Luke
the Physician, pp. 171 et seq.; Pauline and other Studies,
pp. 172, 173. On the general question of sacred waters in
Syria, see Robertson-Smith, op. cit. pp. 170-172; Frazer,
op. cit. pp. 22-23.</p></note>

from the temple in which many sacred fishes of different
kinds are reared.<ref n="56"/> Some of these grow to a great size;
they are called by names, and approach when called. I
saw one of these ornamented with gold, and on its back
fin a golden design was dedicated to the temple. I have
often seen this fish, and he certainly carried this design.

</p></div>


<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="46">
<p>The depth of the lake is immense. I never tested 200 it myself, but they say that it is in depth more than
fathoms. In the midst of this lake stands an altar of
stone. You would think at first sight that it was floating
and moving in the water, and many deem that it is so.
The truth seems to me that it is supported by a column
of great size, based on the bottom of the lake. It is
always decked with ribbons, and spices are therein, and
many every day swim in the lake with crowns on their
heads performing their acts of adoration.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="47"><head>Ceremony at the Lake</head>
<p>
At this lake great assemblies meet, and these are
called descents into the lake because all their deities go
down into this lake, amongst whom Hera<ref n="57"/> first advances

<note n="56"><p>See also § 14, n. 28. No local tradition of this seems to
survive, but Xenophon (Anabasis, I. iv. 9) records a
parallel case of “tame fish looked upon as gods” in the
Chalus, near Aleppo. Modern instances near Doliche, just
north of Aintab, and elsewhere in Syria, are described by
Cumont (Oriental Relig., p. 245, note 36) and Hogarth
(op. cit., p. 188). So also near the mosque of Edessa
(Sachau, Retse, p. 196); and in Asia Minor, at Tavshanli,
on the Rhyndacus, sacred fish are still preserved in a large
cistern (Cumont, Joc. cit., ap. Munro).</p>

<p>Atargatis, according to the form of the legend given by
the scholiast on Germanicus’ “Aratus” was born of an egg
which the sacred fishes found in the Euphrates and pushed
ashore. On the general subject, see Robertson-Smith,
op. cit. p. 292, also pp. 174-175 and 219.</p></note>

<note n="57"><p>Cf. the legend that Hera bathed in the Chaboras, a
Mesopotamian tributary of the Euphrates, after her mar-
riage with Zeus (A¢lian, Nat. Animalium, xii. 30). The
further reference to fishes implies their sanctity to the
goddess, and to this extent reveals Atargatis as a fish-
goddess (see note 25). This is, however, clearly not her
chief character at Hierapolis.</p></note>

so that Zeus may not see the fish first, for if this were
to happen they say that one and all would perish. And
Zeus comes indeed intending to see these fish, but she,
standing before him, keeps him at bay, and with many
supplications holds him off. or</p></div>

<head>Ceremony at the Euphrates</head>
<p>
But the greatest of these sacred assemblies are
those held on the sea coast.<ref n="58"/> About these, however, I have
nothing certain to say. I was never present at their
celebrations, nor did I undertake the journey thither;
but I did see what they do on their return, and I will at
once tell you. Each member of the assembly carries a
vessel full of water. The vessels are sealed with wax;
those who carry the water do not unseal the vessels
and then pour out the water; but there is a certain
holy cock<ref n="59"/> who dwells hard by the lake. This bird, on

the Euphrates, see note 23. On the further subject of the

sea water into empty sealed vessels.</p></note>

less we suppose that the words by allusion or textual
change signify some special priestly office. Thus Blunt
(Works of Lucian, London: Briscoe, 1711, p. 267)
translates “a sacred cock, or priest, called Alectryo.” Is
it possible that the word in this sense was in common
vogue, on the analogy of the Latin Gallus,a cock? (Cf. an
inscription on an urn in the Lateran Museum at Rome, cited
by Frazer, op. cit. p. 233, on which the cock is used as
emblem of the Attis-priest, with a punning reference to the
word.) Belin de Ballu, in his translation (Paris, 1789),
v. 178, following Paulmier de Grentruéuil, unhesitatingly
substitutes Γάλλος, and translates accordingly.</p></note>

receiving the vessels from the bearers, inspects the seal,
and after receiving a reward for this action he breaks the
thread and picks away the wax, and many minae are
collected by the cock by this operation. After this the
bearers carry the water into the temple and pour it forth,
and they depart when the sacrifice is finished.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="49">
<head>Festival of the Pyre</head>
<p>
The greatest of the festivals that they celebrate is
that held in the opening of spring; some call this the
Pyre, others the Lamp. On this occasion the sacrifice is
performed in this way. They cut down tall trees and set
them up in the court; then they bring goats and sheep
and cattle and hang them living to the trees; they add to
these birds and garments and gold and silver work.
After all is finished, they carry the gods around the trees
and set fire under;<ref n="60"/> in a moment all is in a blaze. To



<note n="60"><p>In this festival of the Pyre at Heliopolis one or two details
may profitably be noticed. The “tall trees’ suggest the
pine, sacred to Attis. (Cf., inter alia, Farnell, Cults,
p- 645, and Frazer, op. cit., p. 222.) It is possible that in
the sculptures of Boghaz-Keui the objects on which the high
priest stands (L. H., pl. lxviii.) are indeed fir-cones. Goats
and sheep we have seen led to sacrifice at Eyuk; the
former animal is frequently represented in association with
the Hittite chief god, and was no doubt sacred to him.
“Cattle” indicate the bull, the emblem of the great god,
and the cow with which his consort might be reciprocally
identified. Cf. Pausanias (XI., iii. 7), where the bull and
cow are seen to be sacred to Zeus and Hera respectively;
and compare especially the details of the Dedala with this
holocaust. The hanging of garments or shreds of them on
trees near sacred places, or trees themselves, is a common
practice in the East and in Egypt to-day. (Cf. also 
Rob.-Smith, op. cit., p. 335.) In the last words of the paragraph
it is significant that no special mention is made of a goddess
in connection with this rite.</p></note>

this solemn rite a great multitude flocks from Syria and
all the regions around. Each brings his own god and
the statues which each has of his own gods.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="50">
	<head>The Galli</head>
    <p>
On certain days a multitude flocks into the temple,
and the Galli in great numbers, sacred as they are,
perform the ceremonies of the men and gash their arms
and turn their backs to be lashed.<ref n="61"/> Many bystanders
play on the pipes the while many beat drums; others
sing divine and sacred songs. All this performance
takes place outside the temple, and those engaged in the
ceremony enter not into the temple.

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="51">
<head>Their Initiation Ceremonies</head>
<p>During these days they are made Galli. As the
Galli sing and celebrate their orgies, frenzy falls on
many of them and many who had come as mere
spectators afterwards are found to have committed the
great act. I will narrate what they do. Any young
man who has resolved on this action, strips off his clothes,
and with a loud shout bursts into the midst of the crowd,
and picks up a sword from a number of swords which I
suppose have been kept ready for many years for this
purpose. He takes it and castrates himself<ref n="62"/> and then
runs wild through the city, bearing in his hands what he
has cut off. He casts it into any house at will, and from

<head>Their Burial</head>
<p>
The Galli, when dead, are not buried like other
men, but when a Gallus dies his companions carry him
out into the suburbs, and laying him out on the bier
on which they had carried him they cover him with
stones, and after this return home. They wait then for
seven days, after which they enter the temple. Should
they enter before this they would be guilty of blasphemy.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="53"><p>
The laws which they observe are the following:
Anyone who has seen a corpse may not enter the
temple the same day; but afterwards, when he has
purified himself, he enters. But those who are of the
family of the corpse wait for thirty days, and after
shaving their heads they enter the temple, but before
they have done this it is forbidden.</p></div>

<note n="66"><p>Cf. also § 16. This statement is confirmed by Xeno-
phon, Anabasis, I. iv. 9. According to Alian (Nat. Ann.
iv. 2), the dove was an especially sacred companion to
Astarte, and this is borne out by archaic clay figurines of
the goddess from Phoenicia, Asia Minor, Rhodes, Delos,
Athens and Etruria. These are ascribed to ‘“Aphrodite”
by Furtwangler (Roscher’s Lexikon f. Griech. u. Rom.
Mythologie, p. 410, g.v.); but are indistinguishable as to
character and provenance from the original deity. (Cf.
also Ed. Meyer, in the same, art. Astarte.) In Babylonian
and Assyrian art and mythology the bird does not seem to
appear in the same inseparable association with Ishtar,
though we have the suggestive passage: “Like a lonely
dove, I rest” (Pinches, op. cit., col. iii. ll. 1, 2). On this
point Mr. L. W. King writes: ‘In the earlier periods
there is no evidence that a bird was associated with Ishtar,
and I have little doubt that the association was a com-
paratively late addition to her cult. Of course the myth
of the Allatu bird is early, but can hardly be connected
with the symbolic or votive bird under her Phoenician
form” (Letter dated Sept. 7, 1912). Diodorus relates
how the child Semiramis was fed by doves, and how
eventually she took flight to heaven in the appearance of
this bird.</p>

<p>In Hittite art of Asia Minor, however, the bird appears in
association with the enshrined Goddess-mother, at Yarre
(Jour. Hell. Stud. xix. fig. 4), at Fraktin (Fig. 7), and in two
carvings from Marash (L. H., pp. 119, 151, 164).</p>

<p>In glyptic art the evidence of association is confirmatory
(see Hayes Ward, Seal Cylinders of Western Asia,
pp. 293, etc., especially Nos. 898, 904, 908, 943). With the
naked goddess, who may be of Syrian origins (ibid. p. 162),
and is found represented on a sculpture of Carchemish
(L. H., p. 128), but not elsewhere on Hittite monuments,
the bird appears only sporadically.</p>

<p>Among the Semites the pigeon was peculiarly sacred
(Robertson-Smith, op. cit. p. 294), and sacrificed only on
special occasions (tbid. p. 219; cf. also Leviticus xix. 4, 49;
Numbers, vi. 10). The sacred character of the bird does
not seem to survive in any form.</p></note>

unknowingly they are unholy for that day, and so when
the pigeons dwell with the men they enter their rooms
and commonly feed on-the ground.</p></div>

I will speak, too, about those who come to these
sacred meetings and of what they do. As soon as a
man comes to Hierapolis he shaves his head and his
eyebrows;<ref n="67"/> afterwards he sacrifices a sheep<ref n="68"/> and cuts
up its flesh and eats it; he then lays the fleece on the
ground, places his knee on it, but puts the feet and
head of the animal on his own head and at the same
time he prays that the gods may vouchsafe to receive
him, and he promises a greater victim hereafter. When
this is performed he crowns his head with a garland
and the heads of all those engaged in the same pro-
cession, Starting from his house he passes into the
road, previously bathing himself and drinking cold
water. He always sleeps on the ground, for he
may not enter his bed till the completion of his
journey.</p></div>

In the city of Hierapolis a public host receives
him, suspecting nothing, for there are special hosts
attached to each city, and these receive each guest
according to his country. These are called by the

solemn rites.

<head>Method of Sacrifice. The Libation</head>
<p>
They sacrifice victims not in the temple itself, but
when the sacrificer has placed his victim at the altar and
poured a libation<ref n="69"/> he brings the animal home alive, and
returning to his own house he slays his victim and utters
prayers.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="58">
<head>Human Sacrifice</head>
<p>
Thereis also another method of sacrifice, as follows:
They adorn live victims with ribbons and throw them
headlong down from the temple’s entrance, and these
naturally die after their fall. Some actually throw their
own children down, not as they do the cattle, but they
sew them into a sack and toss them down, visiting them
with curses and declaring that they are not their children,
but are cows.<ref n="70"/></p></div>

<note n="69"><p>The libation is a feature of Hittite worship repre-
sented on several sculptures, e.g., at Fraktin and at Malatia
(see Fig. 1, p. 5). At the latter place live animals (rams)
are shown in the sculpture (L. H., pl. xliv.) behind the
priest, being led by an attendant. This is not shown in
our illustration, in which also the Hittite hieroglyphics
are omitted from the field for the sake of clearness. These
sculptures have been lately removed, it is reported, to
Constantinople.</p></note>

<note n="70"><p>The special character of this sacrifice is strongly sug-
gestive of a totemistic influence. On the general aspect
of human sacrifice among the Semites, cf. Rob.-Smith,
op. cit., pp. 371, 464. On human sacrifice in the Cult of
Dionysus, cf. Frazer, op. cit., p. 332. Children were
sacrificed to Moloch, who was identified with Cronos, an
original deity of vegetation (cf. Farnell, Culis, p. 28, n.).
Attempts have been made (cf. Dussaud, Rev. Arch., loc.
cit., ap. Movers; Six, Rev. Num., loc. cit.) to identify the
god of Hierapolis with Cronos. While we cannot accept
the theory, this field of enquiry is attractive; and the
suggested identity might arise in myth by grouping the god
as father of the goddess’s son in a natural triad.</p></note>

<head>Sacrifice of Hair</head>
<p>
They have another curious custom, in which they
agree with the Troezenians alone of the Greeks. I will
explain this too. The Troezenians have made a law for
their maidens and youths alike never to marry till they
have dedicated their locks to Hippolytus; and this they
do. It is the same at Hierapolis. The young men
dedicate the first growth on their chin, then they let
down the locks of the maidens, which have been sacred
from their birth; they then cut these off<ref n="72"/> in the temple
and place them in vessels, some in silver vessels, some
in gold, and after placing these in the temple and
inscribing the name on the vessel they depart. I per-
formed this act myself when a youth, and my hair
remains still in the temple, with my name on the
vessel.

<note n="71"><p>Cf. Pliny, Nat. Hist., vi. 4, and xxii. 2. On this
subject, cf. Rob.-Smith, op. cit., p. 334, note 1. In the
Sudan, according to Bruce, some of the tribes tattooed
their stomachs, sides and backs, as with fish-scales.
Professor Strong reminds us that there have been found
a number of bodies of Nubians of the time of the Middle
Empire (c. 2000 B.c.) with definite tattooing; and the
patterns pricked upon the skin of these desiccated bodies
were identical with those painted on the dolls buried with
them. Cf. Dr. Elliot Smith, The Ancient Egyptians, p. 56.</p></note>

<note n="72"><p>See also § 55, where a first act of the pilgrim is to shave
his head; and § 6, where it appears that at Byblos the
female locks could be sacrificed as an alternative to offering
their own persons. At Troezene, according to Pausanias
(xxxii.), the custom was to sacrifice the hair before
marriage. In Catullus, Ode lxvi., Berenice dedicates her
hair to Venus. On the general question, see Robertson-
