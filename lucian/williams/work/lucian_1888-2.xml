<title type="main">PREFACE.</title>

</head>

<p>FOR the few ascertained facts in the life of the greatest <lb/> prose satirist and most brilliant wit of Greek and Latin <lb/> antiquity, we are indebted, almost wholly, to scattered and <lb/> incidental allusions in his own various writings.</p> 
<p>Like his immediate predecessor, Menippus the satirist; <lb/> the illustrious Neo-Platonist, Porphyry, in the third; and <lb/> the orator, Libanius, in the fourth century, Lucian was <lb/> Syrian by birth. He was born at Samosata—its heap of <lb/> ruins still retains the old name almost unchanged-on the <lb/> Euphrates, not far distant from Edessa, and the chief <lb/> city of the district of Kommagene, in the extreme north­ <lb/> east of Syria, about the year 120 A.D. Tradition protracts <lb/> the term of his existence to the age of ninety, or even of <lb/> one hundred years. He thus lived through the reigns of <lb/> Hadrian, the two Antonines, and Commodns, and (at all <lb/> events) the earlier part of the reign of Severus—alto­ <lb/> gether the happiest period of the Roman Empire, and <lb/> one of the most interesting ages in the world's his­ <lb/> tory. Of his earlier life, the brief record supplied <lb/> in his incomplete autobiographical sketch, the Dream, <lb/> so often has been repeated, that it is not necessary to <lb/> do more than to refer to it here. It is enough briefly to <lb/> repeat that the deliberations of a family council deter­ <lb/> mined his parents, who were in poor circumstances, to <lb/> apprentice him, at the age of fifteen, to his maternal uncle, <lb/> a statuary, for whose art he had shown some boyish incli­ <lb/> nation ; that, by a fortunate accident-fortunate, at least, <lb/> for the world of literary, if not of plastic, Art-the breaking <lb/> of a piece of marble, he was induced to run away from his <lb/> master, in resentment at a severe flogging, and to transfer <lb/> 
<pb n="xiv"/>
 his allegiance to Literature (Paideia1) ; or, rather, to <lb/> prepare himself, in the first instance, by a severe course <lb/> of training, for the profession of a rhetor (in modern <lb/> phrase, a public speaker), which eventually led him to em­ <lb/> brace the career of philosophy and letters.</p> 
<p>At this very early stage his memoir, unhappily, comes <lb/> to an end, and we are left to incidental remarks in his more <lb/> considerable productions. His experiences for some years <lb/> lay in the hard school of poverty and neglect (<foreign xml:lang="grc">πένηςκαὶ</foreign>) <lb/> 
<foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀφανής</foreign>). In search of employment, or, rather, to master <lb/>
the rudiments of his profession, the young Lucian wain­ <lb/> dered through the cities of the south-western region <lb/> of the Lesser Asia, the celebrated and highly-cultured <lb/> Ionia, gradually getting rid of his provincial manner and <lb/> dialect, but still conspicuous by his Syrian (or, as he calls <lb/> it, Assyrian) and un-Greek style of dress (The Twice-Accused, 27). In his twentieth year he arrived in Greece, <lb/> and made his first acquaintance with the Platonic philo­ <lb/> sopher Nigrinus, who gives the title to one of his Dialogues. <lb/> He next settled in the Syrian capital, Antioch, where he <lb/> practised at the bar, and acquired considerable reputation <lb/> as a pleader ; but the chicanery and frauds of the inter­ <lb/> preters of the laws soon caused him to abandon that pur­ <lb/> suit (The Fisherman, 29). The skill thus gained he turned <lb/> to lucrative account as travelling disputant (sophistes, as it <lb/> was termed)-a popular and profitable calling, which was as <lb/> common in the philosophic Hellenic and Roman world in the <lb/> second century, A.D., as it was in Scholastic Europe of the <lb/> Middle Ages. In that capacity he traversed Syria and Egypt. <lb/> Soon afterwards he visited Rome (in the year 150), among <lb/> other reasons, to consult an oculist; and in his Nigrinus, <lb/> the literary result of his visit, he stigmatizes the prevail­ <lb/> ing corruptions and laborious trifling of the literary as <lb/> well as fashionable society of the capital. After a stay of <lb/> two years in Italy, he proceeded to southern Gaul, at that <lb/> time, and long previously, celebrated for its schools of 
<note type="footnote"> 1 The fine allegory of the rivalry of Paideia and Techne (" Trade ") <lb/>
may have been suggested to him, in part, by the charming idyll of <lb/> Moschus (in which Europe and Asia appear in a dream to the daughter <lb/> of Kadmus, and contend for her possession), as well as by the Choice of <lb/> Herakles of Prodikus and Xenophon. </note> <lb/> 
<pb n="xv"/>
 rhetoric. In Gaul he continued his profession of public <lb/> lecturer for some ten years, his residence in that country <lb/> being interrupted only by a visit to Olympia. During <lb/> this period, probably, he composed many of his published <lb/> rhetorical pieces.</p> 
<p>Having now secured an independent income, at the age <lb/> of forty, Lucian set out again on his travels, and made a <lb/> journey through Macedonia and Thessaly, on his way to <lb/> his Syrian home. His stay at Samosata was only tempo­ <lb/> rary ; and, inducing his surviving family to remove to <lb/> Athens, in the next year he himself followed them to the <lb/> literary metropolis, which to him, as to every Greek <lb/> or phil-Hellenist, doubtless was an object of supreme <lb/> intellectual curiosity. It was on his journey to Athens <lb/> that he had the interview with the Paphlagonian prophet, <lb/> Alexander, which gave birth to his satire of that name. <lb/> The contempt openly exhibited by him for that eminent <lb/> miracle-worker had almost, as he assures us (Alex. 56, 57), <lb/> cost him his life : for the exasperated Alexander had <lb/> secretly instructed the crew of the vessel, which he had <lb/> insidiously placed at his visitor's disposal, to make away <lb/> with their charge-a conspiracy frustrated only by the <lb/> interposition of the relenting captain. Thus saved from a <lb/> premature and inglorious end, he proceeded on his journey <lb/> to Athens, accompanied by that extraordinary adventurer, <lb/> Peregrinus, or Peregrinus Proteus, whose fiery immolation <lb/> of himself (like that of another Hercules Furens), be­ <lb/> fore the assembled multitude at Olympia, witnessed by <lb/> Lucian, in the year 165, forms the principal subject of the <lb/> Peregrinus.</p> 
<p>At Athens Lucian seems-for there is no positive evi­ <lb/> dence—to have taken up his fixed abode for the greater <lb/> part of his remaining life, occupying himself, as may safely <lb/> be conjectured, in the highest philosophical and literary <lb/> studies, and in the enjoyment of the friendship of such <lb/> exceptional philosophers as Celsus, the famous Platonist-critic of nascent Christianity (in his True Account, known <lb/> to us only through the Reply of Origen, published fifty <lb/> years later), of the Stoic Sostratus, and the Eclectic Be­ <lb/> monax. His sketch of the career of the last, a meritorious <lb/> ethical teacher, forms one of the not rare proofs of his <lb/> 
<pb n="xvi"/>
 esteem for real goodness.1 During this period appeared <lb/> his masterpieceshis principal theological, philosophical, <lb/> and ethical Dialogues—when that consummate skill in the <lb/> management of the marvellous Attic dialect had been <lb/> attained which rivals the style of the best masters, and <lb/> which, as the acquisition of a foreigner, excites the admira­ <lb/> tion of all his editors and critics. Perhaps the only other <lb/> equally remarkable instance of such kind of excellence is <lb/> that of the African Terence.</p> 
<p>When about the age of seventy, impelled, it would seem, <lb/> by imminent poverty-for authors, then, even of the highest <lb/> reputation fell very far short of obtaining from the Sosii <lb/> of the day the immense pecuniary profits now often secured <lb/> by ephemeral writers—Lucian once more resumed his old <lb/> occupation of rhetor or sophist, and produced some of those <lb/> declamatory essays which appear among his published <lb/> works. At a fortunate moment, he found relief from his <lb/> pecuniary difficulties in an official income derived from his <lb/> appointment to the registrarship or clerkship of the law-courts of the Egyptian capital, the presentation to which <lb/> office has variously been assigned to Marcus Aurelius, <lb/> Commodus, and Severus. Chronology seems, on the whole, <lb/> to support the claims of the last prince, who became em­ <lb/> peror in 193, to the honour of saving from destitution the <lb/> greatest literary ornament of the century. To clear him­ <lb/> self from the charge of teaching one thing (in his satire, On <lb/> Hired Dependants) and practising another, by way of sup­ <lb/> plement to that essay he published his Apology. From it, <lb/> incidentally, we learn that he derived a large salary (<foreign xml:lang="grc">πολυτά­ <lb/> λαντος</foreign>) from his legal post. He alleges the forcible argu­ <lb/> ment that, as the Imperial master of the Roman legions <lb/> himself-not to mention numerous less exalted personages <lb/> -by no means refused the richest emoluments of office, 
<note type="footnote">1 The most interesting, and most meritorious, fact recorded in the life <lb/>
of this highly interesting philosopher, who inclined in opinion chiefly to <lb/> the School of Plato, in practice to that of Antisthenes, is his fine remon­ <lb/> strance addressed to the people of Athens, who were contemplating the <lb/> introduction of the cruel " sports" of the Roman amphitheatres. <lb/> “ Refrain, Athenians," he protested, " from voting this, until you have <lb/> first pulled down your altar erected to Pity " (Dem. 51). See, too, his <lb/> very rational remark on sacrifices (Dem. 6). </note> <lb/> 
<pb n="xvii"/>
 he, the starving critic, could scarcely be blamed for fol­ <lb/> lowing-in a very humble fashion, and at a very long inter­ <lb/> val—that elevated example For the most part, his official <lb/> duties at Alexandria he devolved upon a deputy, so that <lb/> his learned leisure was little disturbed at Athens, where, <lb/> as already stated, he died at an advanced age, but at what <lb/> date is quite uncertain.</p> 
<p>Such are the somewhat meagre facts collected from his <lb/> writings. To these his earlier biographers or critics, led <lb/> by the lexicographer Suidas, have been pleased to make <lb/> some sensational and apocryphal additions. Suidas, of <lb/> whom nothing is known except that he belongs to a <lb/> very late date in Byzantine literary history, having, pro­ <lb/> bably, in mind the story of the tragic end of the infidel <lb/> Euripides, assures his readers that the " blasphemer" <lb/> found a well-merited end in having been torn to pieces by <lb/> wild dogs ; and, not content with so unique a termination <lb/> to his earthly career, adds, as to his posthumous existence, <lb/> " in the future, with Satan, he will have his portion in <lb/> eternal fire." Another equally discreet authority, of the <lb/> sixteenth century, Raffaelle Maffei (or Volaterranus, as he <lb/> is called from his birthplace), avers that he was a mali­ <lb/> cious apostate from Christianity, attributing to him the <lb/> bon mot, that he had gained nothing from his old creed but <lb/> change of name—Lucianus in place of Lucius (or Lykinus). <lb/> To these and similar mendacious assertions Erasmus re­ <lb/> plies, " they attached to him the name of blasphemer, that <lb/> is, 'evil-speaker;' but they who did so, one may be sure, <lb/> were those whose festering sores he had probed." To his <lb/> bitter and persistent satirical assaults upon the established <lb/> religion, and upon the contending sects of (so-called) “ phi­ <lb/> losophy,” we may be sure, not a few (ephemeral) replies <lb/> appeared : but no notices of them have come down to <lb/> us. While, however, the last echoes of pagan sacerdotal <lb/> or sectarian animosity, excited by his exposures, died away <lb/> at the establishment of Christianity, orthodox zeal, on the <lb/> other side, even still sometimes regards him as the declared <lb/> enemy of the Christian faith. The hostility of the earlier <lb/> Christian authorities had been aroused, in particular, by <lb/> two very famous Dialogues—the Peregrinus and the Philo­ <lb/> patris (" The Patriot”). As for the latter, it has been proved, <lb/> 
<pb n="xviii"/>
 beyond reasonable doubt, to have been the production of <lb/> a much later writer, bearing the same name as the reputed <lb/> author; while, as for the former, the chief offence origi­ <lb/> nated in a mistaken reading or interpretation of the text, <lb/> where allusion is made to the Founder of Christianity.1 <lb/> In fact, the brief allusions of the Greek satirist to the new <lb/> faith seem to discover less hostility than is displayed in <lb/> his ridicule of the rival Oriental creeds, of the established <lb/> religion itself, or of the popular systems of philosophy and <lb/> ethics.</p> 
<p>If Lucian has been thus vilified by the ignorance or <lb/> malice of critics of early days, on the other hand, from the <lb/> first moment of his resurrection, at the restoration of <lb/> learning-from the first appearance of the editio princess, <lb/> in 1496—he received an enthusiastic recognition of his <lb/> rare merits from the best scholars of the time. Among <lb/> them towers conspicuously the illustrious Erasmus, one of <lb/> the earliest translators (1514), in conjunction with Sir <lb/> Thomas More, of the great master of Ridicule, whom he <lb/> himself so admirably imitates in his Encomium Moriæ 
<note type="footnote"> 1. According to the text of Hemsterhuis and Lehmann, the especially <lb/>
significant and highly interesting passage in question-by many critics <lb/> believed to have been purposely mutilated-reads as follows :—“ At <lb/> which time, he [Peregrinus] made himself thoroughly master of the <lb/> wonderful philosophy of the Christians, associating, in Palestine, with <lb/> their priests and scribes. And-for what need of details -in a short <lb/> time he brought them to be all mere children in his hands, aspiring to <lb/> the character of prophet, to be president of their public services, and COIl­ <lb/> vener of their Assemblies (<foreign xml:lang="grc">θιασάρχης καὶ ξυναγωγεὺς</foreign>), and he was, in fact, <lb/> all in all to them. Of their books some he interpreted and expounded, <lb/> many of them even he himself wrote ; and they regarded him in the <lb/> light of some divine being, set him up as their legislator, and chose <lb/> and publicly acknowledged him as their special patron [here occurs the <lb/> suspected hiatus. They, in fact, worship that great man who was <lb/> crucified in Palestine, because of his introducing into the world this new <lb/> religious mystery (<foreign xml:lang="grc">τελετην</foreign>).”— On the Death of Peregrinus, 11. For <lb/> 
<foreign xml:lang="grc">μέγαν</foreign> his earlier Christian critics seem to have read <foreign xml:lang="grc">μάγον</foreign> ("magician"), <lb/>
a reading which is approved by Gesner; while to the epithet " won­ <lb/> derful" has been assigned an ironical meaning. Of Peregrinus a more <lb/> favourable account is given by Gellius (no very high authority), and <lb/> Ammianus Marcellinus (a late writer), as well as by the Christian <lb/> writers Athenagoras and Tertullian. The Philopatris (in which satirical <lb/> allusion is made to the visions of St. Paul) is assigned to the year 363, the <lb/> date of the Emperor Julian's Persian expedition. Cf. Philopseudes. 16. </note> <lb/>

 (“Praise of Folly"), and, not altogether so happily, in his <lb/> Colloquies. Citing the well-known verse of the Latin satirist­ <lb/> poet, <lb/> Omne tulit punctum qui miscuit utile dulci, <lb/> he protests :—" no one, if not Lucian, has succeeded in illus­ <lb/> trating this truth. He has imitated the raillery, without <lb/> copying the wantonness, of the Old Comedy. Gracious <lb/> heaven ! [deum immortalem is his strong expletive of admira­ <lb/> tion], with what sly humour, with what grace and elegance, <lb/> he touches everything ! With what power of sarcasm he <lb/> holds up every folly to ridicule, how he seasons everything <lb/> with his wonderful wit—touching no absurdity that he does <lb/> not cover with some irony or satire ! Such grace," con­ <lb/> tinues Erasmus, echoing the dictum of Archbishop Photius, <lb/> " dominates in his style, there is so much felicity of inven­ <lb/> tion, so much elegance in his wit, such pungency in his more <lb/> serious assaults; he so tickles with his allusions, so mingles <lb/> the grave with the gay, in such a way does he enunciate <lb/> truth with a smile, so admirably does he picture the <lb/> manners, the characters, the pursuits of men, as it were, <lb/> with a painter's pencil; in such a manner does he display <lb/> things which we can not only read but actually see, that <lb/> whether one regards entertainment, or utility and instruc­ <lb/> tion, there is no comedy, no satire, that has a right to be <lb/> put in competition with his Dialogues." At the beginning <lb/> of the sixteenth century, at least, this high eulogy was <lb/> scarcely an exaggeration.</p> 
<p>Among the Dialogues translated (into Latin) by Erasmus, <lb/> it is interesting to note, are the Timon and the Alexander; <lb/> by More (who, as an ecclesiastical zealot, and as Lord Chan­ <lb/> cellor, so soon forgot the spirit of his author, and the <lb/> principles of his own Utopia), the Menippus, the Philo­ <lb/> pseudes (" The Lover of Lies "), and the Tyrannicide. Even <lb/> Melancthon, the associate of Luther in the Reformation <lb/> struggle in Germany, assisted in the work of annotating the <lb/> great sceptic (1527). Rabelais, although there is no evi­ <lb/> dence that he took part in illustrating so congenial a mind, <lb/> must have been greatly indebted to him. Early in the next <lb/> century (1615) his most considerable French editor, Bour­ <lb/> delot, enthusiastically maintains that, " in proportion as the <lb/> 
<pb n="xx"/>
 influence of Lucian's writings was diffused, the love of <lb/> knowledge and virtue increased, which still resides in the <lb/> hearts of a few ;” and goes so far as to affirm that by such <lb/> influence the culture, and even civilization, of the philoso­ <lb/> pher s native country perceptibly benefited in the succeeding <lb/> age. A Dutch critic, Hoogstraaten, believes him to have <lb/> been not only the greatest genius of his own age, but even <lb/> of all antiquity. These high eulogiums, for the most part, <lb/> have been repeated by later critics to the days of Hemster­ <lb/> huis and Reitz (whose judicious settlement of the text, and <lb/> criticism and summary of the labours of preceding editors <lb/> and annotators, respectively, first made to the world a <lb/> worthy presentation of his genuine and attributed produc­ <lb/> tions), and by competent judges of our own time. The <lb/> English historian of Greek Literature, J. W. Donaldson, <lb/> holds that “his merits can scarcely be over-estimated," <lb/> and considering him with reference to his own age, and <lb/> to the Literature of Greece," justly adds the learned his­ <lb/> torian, “a position of the utmost importance must be <lb/> assigned to him, both in regard to the systems of religion <lb/> and of philosophy to which he gave the death-blow, and <lb/> in respect to the cultivation of a purer style which <lb/> he vainly taught and exemplified.” During the sixteenth <lb/> century sixty-five editions (in Greek or Latin), in the <lb/> seventeenth twenty-two, in the eighteenth forty-four (be­ <lb/> sides translations), bore ample witness to the estimation <lb/> in which he was held by the learned world. In England <lb/> the first edition of him (and that only in part) did not <lb/> appear till 1677. The first version (in part) in 1634. No <lb/> English translation of any pretension appeared till that <lb/> of Carr (1775-1798), a spirited, but extremely free, presen­ <lb/> tation of him, which was followed by that of Franklin <lb/> Professor of Greek at Cambridge (1780), and of Tooke <lb/> (1820) Franklin's, although not very faithful or accu­ <lb/> rate, being altogether the most valuable of the three chief <lb/> English presentations of Lucian. Of French translations, <lb/> lalbot s sions, (1857) has the greatest repute. Of German ver­ <lb/> that of Wieland, the well-known poet and romancist <lb/> (1788), is easily first; and, indeed, it is generally held to <lb/> be entitled to the foremost place among all attempts at a <lb/> modern representation of the Greek wit.</p> 
<pb n="xxi"/>
 
<p>Lucian is almost encyclopædic in the extent and rarity <lb/> of his productions — critic, moralist, philosopher, poli­ <lb/> tician, poet, romancist, litterateur. Of the eighty-four <lb/> separate writings attributed to him, and published in the <lb/> editions of his works, not a few find an undeserved place <lb/> there. Some pieces of inferior merit are the production of <lb/> his earlier rhetorical period, and show sufficiently evident <lb/> traces of the stilted style characteristic of the fashionable <lb/> declamatory essay, as well in matter as in manner. Of his <lb/> undoubted productions, the shorter pieces—Dialogues of <lb/> the Gods, of the Sea-Gods, and of the Dead—by reason of <lb/> their popular subject-matter and peculiar graces of style, <lb/> have always been most generally read. His more con­ <lb/> siderable masterpieces are Zeus the Tragedian, the Sale <lb/> of Lives, the Timon, the Ferry Boat, the Twice Accused, the <lb/> Fisherman, the Fugitives, the Banquet, the Convicted Zeus, <lb/> the Convention of the Gods, the Charon, the Icaro-Menippus, <lb/> the True History, the Prometheus, the Philopseudes, How <lb/> History Ought to be Written (the first attempt at a philo­ <lb/> sophy of history, but not of sustained merit throughout), <lb/> the Peregrinus, On Sacrifices, On Mourning, and the Alex­ <lb/> ander. In the Greek Anthology twenty Epigrams are ascribed <lb/> to a writer bearing the name of Lucian. Whether the <lb/> composition of the Lucian or not, they are by no means <lb/> unworthy of his genius,1 and they are among the best in <lb/> the whole extensive Collection.</p> 
<p>It is his theological Dialogues that have most contributed 
<note type="footnote"> 1 Especially admirable are those numbered ix., XIII., xcvi. (Westmin­ <lb/>
ster Selection); XXXVIII., LX., LXII., LXIII. (Eton Selection); XXXII., <lb/> XL., CCLXIII. (Edwards's Selection), Bohn's English edition, 1854. <lb/> E. g.:—“ The wealth of the soul is the only true wealth " (xx., Ed. S.). <lb/> " Let a seal on words not to be spoken lie on the tongue. A careful <lb/> watch over words is better than one over wealth " (XL .,Ed. S.). "Address <lb/> to the Gout:”—“O Goddess! who hatest the Poor, and art the sole <lb/> subduer of wealth, who knowest how to live ‘ well' at all times, thou <lb/> delightest to be supported on strange feet, and knowest how to wear <lb/> shoes of felt, and ointments are a care to thee. Thee, too, garlands <lb/> delight, and the liquor of the Ausonian Bacchus. But these things <lb/> never exist, at any time, for the Poor. And, therefore, thou fliest from <lb/> the threshold of Poverty, that has no gold, and art delighted, on the <lb/> other hand, in coming to the feet of Wealth" (XXXII., Ed. S.). This. <lb/> rich subject for satire inspired the burlesque drama of Lucian, entitled <lb/> Tragopodagra (" Gout in Tragedy "). </note> <lb/> 
<pb n="xxii"/>
 to his fame. The inimitable Hellenic arts of architecture <lb/> and of sculputre which adorned, disguised, and, in some <lb/> measure, served to redeem the character of the religion of <lb/> Zeus, or Jupiter, had long shown symptoms of decay, the <lb/> outward and visible sign of a corresponding coolness in the <lb/> " religious ” feeling of the upper classes ; but the religion <lb/> of Homer and Hesiod still kept fast hold of the affections <lb/> of the body of the peoples (as it continued to do, in fact, <lb/> throughout the country districts, longafter the State <lb/> recognition of Christianity), while the great majority of <lb/> the educated or influential sections of society regarded it <lb/> as a useful means of retaining the masses in subjection.1 <lb/> To undermine this imposing structure of mingled fraud <lb/> and imposture, the absurdities, the follies, and the hypo­ <lb/> crisies of its various adherents, Lucian especially devoted <lb/> his almost unrivalled powers of wit and sarcasm ; and, if <lb/> ridicule could inflict a mortal wound, he might have been <lb/> well satisfied with his brilliant efforts. But reflection on <lb/> the history of the Past must sometimes have inspired him <lb/> with some misgiving, or even despair. For he was far <lb/> from having been the first to expose the character of the <lb/> orthodox Theology. In the drama, the most popular form <lb/> of literature in Hellas—in Tragedy, Euripides (of the school <lb/> of Sokrates) had, in the latter half of the fourth century, <lb/> given expression to the more rational belief of the best­ <lb/> educated minds of the time; in Comedy, the conservative <lb/> Aristophanes, in his inimitable dramas, whether purposely <lb/> or not, had held up to the most open and undisguised <lb/> contempt the most sacred objects of the national and <lb/> popular worship. In the two next centuries Scepticism <lb/> was rampant. In the lighter forms of literature, the Mimes <lb/> (" parodies ") of Sophron of Syrakuse, and the bitter <lb/> satires (silloi, as they were termed) of Timon of Phlius, a <lb/> disciple of Pyrrho, whose name has given a synonym for <lb/> the extremest scepticism, held up to derision the occupants <lb/> of the national Pantheon. Such rationalistic writers, too, <lb/> as Euhemerus, author of the Sacred Inscriptions; Palæ­ <lb/> phatus, author of the Incredible Legends; and, in parti­ <lb/> cular, Menippus, were direct predecessors of the satirist of

 Samosata. But these more popular writers were not the <lb/> only assailants of the Pagan Pantheon : and it is enough <lb/> merely to mention the names of Anaxagoras, Xenophanes, <lb/> Demokritus, Zeno (the founder of the Stoic School), <lb/> Antisthenes (the founder of the most practical satirists, <lb/> the Cynics), and, above all, Epikurus, to recall their wide <lb/> divergences from, and sometimes direct assaults on, <lb/> the Olympian theology. -To Lucian, however, as to Vol­ <lb/> taire, in the last century, was reserved, in very special <lb/> degree, the work of popularizing and bringing within the <lb/> reach of the most ordinary intelligence the various labours <lb/> of his predecessors. Of his models in the Dialogue form of <lb/> writing, Plato and Xenophon are most commonly quoted: <lb/> but the eloquent founder of the Academy, and the author <lb/> of the Œconomicus, rather improved than originated it. <lb/> Sophron of Syracuse, and Zeno of Elea in Italy, had already <lb/> brought it into use. In the following century, Antisthenes <lb/> also employed it.</p> 
<p>As for the ethical character of Lucian, if we may trust <lb/> to his own representation of himself, it deserves high <lb/> praise. In the Dream, among the superior advantages <lb/> offered by Paideia, he gives prominent place to the virtues <lb/> of justice, mildness, and reasonableness. In his Revived <lb/> Philosophers, he declares himself to be a hater of falsehood, <lb/> of imposture, of arrogance, of pride, a lover of truth, of <lb/> beauty, of sincerity, and all things lovely (<foreign xml:lang="grc">ὅσα τῷ φιλει̃σθαι <lb/> συγγενη̃</foreign>). He abandoned the profession of the Law from <lb/> disgust for its iniquity, or for the fraudulent methods of <lb/> its practisers. He engages, as he declares, in the war against <lb/> Falsehood quite conscious that he is fighting a desperate <lb/> battle-that the vast majority are against him (Fisher­ <lb/> man, 20). In his biography of his friend, Demonax, his <lb/> appreciation of that superior Cynic exhibits him as a <lb/> sympathetic admirer of true worth. In one department of <lb/> Morals—on the assumption of his having been the author <lb/> of the scandalous Erotes (“Loves”)—he has been made the <lb/> subject of undeserved censure; for its tedious dulness and <lb/> its frigid and sophisticated tone, alike foreign to Lucian's <lb/> manner, prove it to be spurious.</p> 
<p>It has been sometimes objected to Lucian's philosophical <lb/> claims, that he made no attempt to build anew upon the ruins <lb/> 
<pb n="xxiv"/>
 of the religious system overthrown by him. But, in the first <lb/> place, systems of "faith," or “morals,” already abounded <lb/> ad nauseam, and to have erected another system of " philo­ <lb/> sophy " would have been only to add to the existing confu­ <lb/> sion. The work immediately and urgently needed was <lb/> that of complete destruction, and the clearing of the ground <lb/> for the future dissemination of higher and no bIer ideas. <lb/> This he did-at all events, as far as religionism and meta­ <lb/> physical shams were concerned-with the persistent zeal <lb/> of a sincere reformer. In the second place, if the charge <lb/> be a substantial one, he shares the blame with almost every <lb/> destructive critic of after ages, whose opportunities for <lb/> establishing better faiths have been superior to his. The <lb/> charge to which he is more justly open-and it is the <lb/> only grave fault, perhaps, in his writings-is indiscrimi­ <lb/> nation in his assaults on the philosophies of the day. His, <lb/> apparently, contemptuous treatment, in particular, of Pytha­ <lb/> goreanism, the parent of Platonism, and the philosophical <lb/> school which was most productive of examples of the <lb/> higher virtues as well as of intellectual ability, deserves <lb/> censure. In his Sale of Lives, in the Revived Philosophers, <lb/> and in one of the Dialogues of the Dead in particular, he <lb/> seems to have yielded to the temptation-a sort of tempta­ <lb/> tion to which great wits have always been liable-of utilizing <lb/> matter so promising as the ridiculous fables which the ene­ <lb/> mies of Pythagoreanism abundantly supplied.1 That among <lb/> the (self-styled) followers of Pythagoras were to be found <lb/> some pretenders, and not a few extravagant expositors of <lb/> his teaching-as such are found in all societies or sects— <lb/> is sufficiently probable; but to hold up indiscriminately to <lb/> ridicule what was, in the main, a meritorious system of <lb/> (ethical) philosophy-that, certainly, did not become the <lb/> character of a just critic. He lived, indeed, before the <lb/> appearance of the School of New or Newer Platonism, 
<note type="footnote"> 1 In the Sale or Auction of Lives, Pythagoras, who responds to the <lb/>
inquiries of the bidder, as to his qualifications, that he does " not eat <lb/> the flesh of animals, but everything else except beans," is sold at the <lb/> price of forty pounds. Epikurus (to whose school, if to any, Lucian <lb/> himself belonged), or rather an Epikurean, is sold for only eight pounds. <lb/> Yet, in his Alexander he speaks of the founder of " The Garden " almost <lb/> with the profound reverence and esteem of Lucretius. </note> <lb/> 
<pb n="xxv"/>
 whose founders, Plotinus, Ammonins, and Porphyry (the <lb/> most erudite of all the later Greek scholars), belong to the <lb/> following century. Extravagant as may have been some of <lb/> their speculations, the New-Platonists, by their noble, if <lb/> hopelessly futile, attempts to reform and spiritualize the <lb/> established religion, and by their noble protests against the <lb/> gross practical Materialism of life, have deserved (equally <lb/> with the early Christians), among the various contending <lb/> sects of religion or philosophy, very high esteem. Had he <lb/> witnessed their self-denying lives, and been acquainted with <lb/> their exalted ideas and aspirations, we may with some con­ <lb/> fidence believe that he would have done justice to their <lb/> real merits, as distinguished from the errors of judgment <lb/> which lay on the surface, and which were the inevitable <lb/> outcome of the scientific defects of the age.</p> 
<p>The present volume includes what may be termed the <lb/> principal theological Dialogues. In the spelling of Greek <lb/> names, in the transitional and unsettled state of Greek <lb/> orthography in this country, any attempt to adopt a more <lb/> natural method must, necessarily, be a compromise : hence <lb/> the present version is open to the charge of some ortho­ <lb/> graphical inconsistency. As for the translation itself, the <lb/> method adopted has been to adhere as closely to the ori­ <lb/> ginal as essential differences of idiom allow : to represent <lb/> Lucian's peculiar graces of style no translator can reason­ <lb/> ably aspire. The versions, entire or partial, which have <lb/> appeared up to this time, however spirited they may be-­ <lb/> and the German Wieland surpasses all his rivals in this <lb/> respect, in whose hands, as Lehmann expresses it, “all <lb/> Lucian lives and breathes "-for the most part are not <lb/> distinguished by any very strict fidelity to their original. <lb/> The text followed is that of the great work of Hemsterhuis <lb/> and Reitz (in Lehmann's edition), which has been com­ <lb/> pared with the alternative readings adopted by Jacobitz.</p>

<p>Zeus. Not an infinitesimal part that of what you ought <lb/> to suffer.</p> 
<p>Prometheus. Yet you shall not release me without recom­ <lb/> pense. But I will impart something to you, Zeus, ex­ <lb/> ceedingly important.</p> 
<p>Zeus. You are for outwitting me, Prometheus.</p> 
<p>Prometheus. And what advantage should I gain ? For <lb/> you will not be ignorant hereafter of the whereabouts of <lb/> Kaucasus ; neither will you be in want of chains, should I <lb/> be caught playing you any trick.</p> 
<p>Zeus. Say, first, what sort of equivalent you will pay, of <lb/> so much importance to us.</p> 
<p>Prometheus. If I tell you for what purpose you are now <lb/> on your travels, shall I have credit with you, when I <lb/> prophesy about the rest ?</p> 
<p>Zeus. Of course.</p> 
<p>Prometheus. You are off to Thetis, to an intrigue with her.</p> 
<p>Zeus. That indeed you have correct knowledge of. But <lb/> what then, after that ? For you seem to have some inkling <lb/> of the truth.</p> 
<p>Prometheus. Don't have anything to do with the Nereid, <lb/> Zeus: for, if she should be pregnant by you, her progeny <lb/> will treat you exactly as you, too, treated<ref n="1"/>—</p> 
<p>Zeus. This do you assert-that I shall be expelled from <lb/> my kingdom ?</p> 
<p>Prometheus. Heaven forbid, Zeus ! Intercourse with her, <lb/> however, threatens something of the kind.</p> 
<p>Zeus. Good-bye to Thetis, then. And as for you, for <lb/> these timely warnings Hephæstus shall set you free.

<p>Eros. Well, if I have really done wrong at all, Zeus, <lb/> pardon me : for I am but an infant, and still without sense.</p> 
<p>Zeus. You an infant—you the Eros, who are far older <lb/> than Iapetus ? 1 Because you have not grown a beard, and <lb/> don't show gray hairs, do you really claim on that account <lb/> to be considered an infant, when, in fact, you are an old <lb/> scamp ?</p> 
<p>Eros. But what great injury have I—the old scamp, as <lb/> you call me—done you, that you intend putting me in <lb/> irons ?</p> 
<p>Zeus. Consider, accursed rascal, whether they are trifling <lb/> injuries you have done me, you, who make such sport of <lb/> me, that there is nothing which you have not turned me <lb/> into-satyr, bull, gold, swan, eagle2—but not any one of <lb/> them have you made to be in love with me at all; nor <lb/> have I perceived that, for anything that depends upon you, <lb/> I have been agreeable to any woman; but I am obliged to <lb/> have recourse to juggling tricks against them, and to <lb/> conceal my proper self, while they are really in love with <lb/> the bull or swan, and, if they have but a glimpse of me, <lb/> they die of fear.3</p>

<p>Zeus. Get away with you. I would not take the offer of <lb/> being loved, on condition of becoming such a figure.</p> 
<p>Eros. Then, Zeus, don't wish to love, either: that, at all <lb/> events, is an easy matter.</p>

<p>Zeus. Hermes, you know the daughter of Inachus, the <lb/> famous beauty ?</p> 
<p>Hermes. Yes, you mean the far-famed Io.</p> 
<p>Zeus. She is no longer a girl, but a heifer.</p> 
<p>Hermes. Prodigious that! But how was she trans­ <lb/> formed ?</p>

 not only that, but s'he has also contrived another sort of <lb/> new mischief against the unfortunate girl. She has <lb/> appointed a certain cowkeeper with eyes all over him, who <lb/> tends the heifer with sleepless care.</p> 
<p>Hermes. What must I do, then ?</p> 
<p>Zeus. Fly down to Nemea—it's somewhere there that <lb/> Argus tends his charge-and kill him off. But as for Io, <lb/> bring her away by sea to Egypt, and transform her into Isis.1 <lb/> And, for the future, let her be a divinity to the people of <lb/> the country, and let her raise the Nile, and send favourable <lb/> winds, and be the patron-saint of sailors.2</p>

<p>Zeus. Come, Ganymede—for we have arrived at the <lb/> proper place-kiss me now, that you may know that I have <lb/> no longer crooked beak, nor sharp talons, nor wings such <lb/> as I appeared to you, under the semblance of a bird.3 
<note type="footnote"> 1 For this, one of the most famous of the metamorphoses of the Greek <lb/>
Theology, see Ovid, Metam. i. 13-17. Io appears as one of the dramatis <lb/> personæ of the <foreign xml:lang="grc">Προμήθευς Δεσμώτης</foreign> of Æschylus, where she is represented <lb/> as brought in her wanderings to the Caucasian Valley, in which Pro­ <lb/> metheus was impaled, and bewails the <hi rend="italic"><foreign xml:lang="grc">διαφθορὰν υορφη̃ς</foreign></hi>, as she terms <lb/> it. Cf. the ‘<foreign xml:lang="grc">Ικέτιδες</foreign> of the same dramatist. Strabo, Diodorus, Apollo­ <lb/> dorus, and Pausanias add particulars to the Ovidian story. Evidently <lb/> the Greeks derived the myth, in the first instance, from the Egyptian <lb/> priests. </note>

recorded the gratitude of rescued passengers and sailors to their pro­ <lb/> tectress.

Pausanias (‘<foreign xml:lang="grc">Ελλάδος Περιήγησις</foreign>, x. 32) describes the ritual <lb/> of One of the temples, or shrines, of Isis in Phocis—“ the holiest" of all <lb/> her Greek sanctuaries-and records the punishment of certain rash and <lb/> inquisitive intruders. “ So," adds Pausanias, " Homer's word seems true <lb/> that the Gods are not seen by mortals with impunity.”—See Bohn's <lb/> Series. </note>

<p>Ganymedes. Were you not an eagle but just now, fellow, <lb/> and did you not pounce down and carry me off from the <lb/> midst of my flock ? How then have those feathers fallen <lb/> off fromyou entirely, and you have now come out in quite <lb/> a different character ?</p> 
<p>Zeus. But, my dear boy, you see neither a man nor an <lb/> eagle : but it is I here, the king of all the gods, who have <lb/> metamorphosed myself at the right moment.</p> 
<p>Ganymedes. How ? what, are you the great Pan ? Then <lb/> how haven't you a syrinx, or horns, and hairy legs? 1</p> 
<p>Zeus. Why, do you take him to be the only divinity ?</p> 
<p>Ganymedes. Yes, and we sacrifice to him an uncastrated <lb/> he-goat, bringing him to the grotto where the god stands. <lb/> But as for you, you seem to me to be some kidnapping <lb/> slave-dealer2 or other.</p> 
<p>Zeus. Tell me, have you never heard the name of Zeus, <lb/> nor seen on Gargarus an altar to the Rain-Sender, and <lb/> Thunderer, and Lightener ?</p> 
<p>Ganymedes. Do you say, fine Sir,3 that you are the same <lb/> who but lately poured down on us that quantity of hail, <lb/> who are said to live up above, who make such a din, to <lb/> whom my father sacrificed a ram? Then, how have I <lb/> wronged you that you have carried me off, O king of the <lb/> Gods ?

<p>Ganymedes. My father, then, will certainly be looking for <lb/> me, and be angry at not finding me, and I shall be whipped <lb/> by and bye for having left my flock.</p> 
<p>Zeus. Why, where will he see you ?</p> 
<p>Ganymedes. Don't keep me, please, for I am already <lb/> longing to see him. And, if you will take me back, I <lb/> promise you another ram shall be sacrificed by him as my <lb/> ransom. We have the three-year-old one-that fine one, <lb/> who leads the flock to pasture.</p> 
<p>Zeus (aside). How simple and innocent is the child—a <lb/> child yet all over, truly ! But, my dear Ganymede, bid <lb/> farewell to all those things and forget them, your flock, and <lb/> Ida; and you from this place-for you are now enrolled <lb/> among the celestials—will do many services both to your <lb/> father and to your country; and, instead of cheese and <lb/> milk, you will eat ambrosia and drink nectar: this latter, <lb/> indeed, you shall yourself pour out, and offer to the rest of <lb/> us. But, what is more than all, you will no longer be <lb/> mortal, but shall become immortal, and I will make your <lb/> star shine very bright,1 and, in a word, you shall be happy.</p> 
<p>Ganymedes. And if I want to play, who will play with <lb/> me ? On Ida there were many of us, playmates of the <lb/> same age.</p> 
<p>Zeus. Here, too, you have a playmate—Eros there, and <lb/> any number of knuckle-bones.2 Only cheer up, and be bright, <lb/> and don't hanker after any of the things down below there.</p>

<p>Zeus (aside). There again he is thinking of his milk, and <lb/> fancies that he will have to wait upon mortals.—But this <lb/> is heaven here, and we drink, as I told you, the celestial <lb/> nectar.</p> 
<p>Ganymedes. Is it sweeter than milk, Zeus ?</p> 
<p>Zeus. You shall know for yourself shortly; and, when <lb/> you have once tasted it, you will not again have any <lb/> longing for your milk.</p> 
<p>Ganymedes. But where shall I sleep at night ? with my <lb/> playfellow, Eros ?</p> 
<p>Zeus. No. I carried you off on this account-that we <lb/> might sleep together.</p> 
<p>Ganymedes. Why, could you not sleep alone; but is it <lb/> pleasanter to you to sleep with me ?</p> 
<p>Zeus. Yes, with such an one as you, Ganymede, so hand­ <lb/> some as you are.</p> 
<p>Ganymedes. Why, how will handsome looks give you <lb/> pleasure, in respect to sleep ?</p> 
<p>Zeus. They have a certain sweet charm, and bring it on <lb/> more softly.</p> 
<p>Ganymedes. Yet my father used to be annoyed with me, <lb/> when I slept in the same bed with him, and used to tell me <lb/> in the morning how I had taken away his sleep by my <lb/> restlessness and kicking, and talking in my sleep: for <lb/> which reason he would generally send me to bed with my <lb/> mother. If it was on that account, as you say, that you <lb/> carried me off, it is high time for you to put me down on <lb/> the Earth again; or you will be annoyed by being kept <lb/> awake, for I shall disturb you by my continual tossing <lb/> about.</p> 
<p>Zeus. In doing that very thing you will most please me <lb/> —since I shall keep awake with you in frequent kisses and <lb/> embraces.</p> 
<p>Ganymedes. You would have to see to that yourself. As <lb/> for me, while you are kissing me, I shall lull myself to <lb/> steep.</p>

<p>Zeus. What, are you really jealous, Hera, already, about <lb/> so simple and very innocent an affair as that ? I thought <lb/> • you were hard only upon the women, who might happen to <lb/> be intimate with me.</p> 
<p>Hera. Your conduct not even in those matters is proper, <lb/> or becoming to yourself—you, the liege lord of all the <lb/> gods, to desert me, your lawful, wedded wife, and go down <lb/> to Earth to intrigue in the shape of gold, or of a satyr, or <lb/> of a bull. But, at least, those females of yours remain on <lb/> Earth, while this youth from Ida you snatched up and flew <lb/> off with, O most respectable of gods,2 actually lives with <lb/> us, put over my head; a cup-bearer, to be sure-in name. <lb/> Were you so desperately at a loss for butlers, and have <lb/> Hebe and Hephæstus really become worn out in the ser­ <lb/> vice ? And you—you will not take the cup from him <lb/> otherwise than first kissing him in the sight of us all; and <lb/> the kiss is sweeter to you than nectar, and, on that account,

the story of Psyche with a similar scene, when the persecuted bride of <lb/> Eros is admitted to the privilege of immortality and the society of the <lb/> Celestials by drinking nectar. With the Pythagoreans, ambrosia and <lb/> nectar were favourite metaphors for the highest spiritual and intellectual <lb/> enjoyments. " If," says Iamblichus, " partaking of this divine food (of <lb/> Knowledge) cannot make men immortal, at least it will make them <lb/> acquainted with matters of eternal import." </note>

 you are constantly asking to drink, without even being <lb/> thirsty. When, too, after just tasting it, you hand back <lb/> the cup to him, and after he has drunk, you receive it <lb/> from him again, you quaff off the remainder from the <lb/> place where the boy has drunk from, and where he has <lb/> applied his lips, that you may drink and kiss at one and <lb/> the same moment; Nay, but just now you, the King and <lb/> father of the universe, laid aside ægis and thunderbolt, <lb/> and sat down o a game of knuckle-bones with him, with <lb/> All that big beardyou havegrown.1 All these fine doinog <lb/> I see, so don't suppose you are unobserved.</p> 
<p>Zeus. And what dreadful crime is it, Hera, to kiss so <lb/> fair a youth between cups, and to derive pleasure from <lb/> both-the kiss and the nectar ? If, believe me, I were to <lb/> alow him to kiss you once even, you would never again <lb/> blame TIle for thinking the kiss preferable to the nectar.</p> 
<p>Hera. This is the talk of a paederast! But, for my part, <lb/> ayI never be so mad as to offer my lips to this soft <lb/> Phrygian boy, so completely effeminated as he is.</p> 
<p>Zeus. Do not upbraid me, most admirable of goddesses, <lb/> with loves of this sort: 2 for this youth, effeminate, a <lb/> foreigner, soft and girlish as he is, is more agreeable to <lb/> me and more desirable than-but I have no wish to say it <lb/> not to further provoke you.</p>

 insult me, in your cups, on account of this male Hebe of <lb/> yours.</p> 
<p>Zeus. Not so : but that son of yours, Hephæstus, must <lb/> needs act as butler, with his limping gait, coming straight <lb/> from his forge, still covered all over with sparks, his fire-tongs only just laid aside : and from those fingers of his I <lb/> had to receive the goblet, and drawing him to me to greet <lb/> him with a salute between while, whom not even you, his <lb/> mother, would kiss with any pleasure, with his face com­ <lb/> pletely blackened with soot.1 The present arrangement is <lb/> much more agreeable : for will you say that it is not so ? <lb/> That cup-bearer of yours certainly excellently becomes the <lb/> table of the gods; while Ganymede must be sent down <lb/> back to Ida—for he is clean, and rosy-fingered, and hands <lb/> the goblet deftly; and, what most vexes you, gives kisses <lb/> more sweet than nectar.</p> 
<p>Hera. Yes. Hephæstus is lame now, and his fingers are <lb/> not fit to touch your cup, and he is covered with soot, and <lb/> the sight of him turns you sick-ever since Ida produced <lb/> that handsome youth with the flowing locks. Yet, for­ <lb/> merly, you did not observe these things; neither the sparks <lb/> nor the forge turned your stomach so as to prevent your <lb/> drinking from his hand.</p> 
<p>Zeus. You plague yourself to no purpose, Hera, while <lb/> you intensify my love for him by your jealousy. Well, if <lb/> you are annoyed at receiving the goblet from a beautiful <lb/> boy, let your son pour out your wine, and as for you, <lb/> Ganymede, hand the cup only to myself, and at each time <lb/> kiss me twice: when you offer it full, and again whenever <lb/> you take it back from me.—What's this ? In tears ? Don't <lb/> be afraid; if any one has any intention of annoying you <lb/> he will have cause to lament.

<p>Hera. This Ixion,1 Zeus, what sort of character do you <lb/> take him to be ?</p> 
<p>Zeus. A good kind of man, and a boon companion: for <lb/> he would not associate with us, had he been unworthy of <lb/> our table.</p> 
<p>Hera. But he is unworthy of it, for he is an insolent <lb/> fellow : so let him not live with us any longer.</p> 
<p>Zeus. Of what insolence or injury has he been guilty, <lb/> pray ? For I ought to know too, I think.</p> 
<p>Hera. Insolence ? and what else—I blush, however, to <lb/> mention it, such was his daring impertinence.</p> 
<p>Zeus. Yet that is the more reason you should tell me, <lb/> in proportion to the baseness of his attempt. Surely he <lb/> has not attempted any one's virtue, has he ? For I under­ <lb/> stand the disgraceful conduct to be something of a kind <lb/> which you would shrink from telling me.</p> 
<p>Hera. On mine, and no one else's has he made his assaults, <lb/> now for a long time past. At first I was ignorant of the <lb/> reason why he kept staring fixedly at me, while he would <lb/> sigh and secretly drop a tear; and whenever, after drinking, <lb/> I handed the beaker to Ganymede, he would ask to <lb/> drink from the very same place, and would take and kiss <lb/> it between while, and put it to his eyes, and again stare at <lb/> me. These actions I now began to perceive to be amorous <lb/> signs. For a long time I felt ashamed to speak to you, <lb/> and thought that the fellow would cease from his mad <lb/> folly. But when he dared to make his advances to me in <lb/> words, I left him still in tears, and prostrate at my feet; <lb/> and stopping my ears, not to hear even his insolent en-

 treaties, I came away to tell you. Now do you yourself <lb/> look to it, in what manner you shall punish the man.</p> 
<p>Zeus. Is this the fine return the cursed villain makes to <lb/> myself-even so far as to aspire to the favours of Hera ? <lb/> Has he become so drunk on our nectar ? But we ourselves <lb/> are the cause of these outrages, and are out of all measure <lb/> philanthropic, in making men our boon-companions. They <lb/> have some excuse, therefore, if, while drinking on equal <lb/> terms with us, and beholding celestial beauties, and of a <lb/> sort they never have seen on earth, overpowered by love, <lb/> they eagerly long to enjoy them. Well, Love is an intract­ <lb/> able sort of creature, and governs not only men, but even <lb/> ourselves sometimes.</p> 
<p>Hera. Of you he certainly is very much the master, and <lb/> drives and leads you captive, " dragging you," as they say, <lb/> "by the nose; " and you follow him wherever he may lead <lb/> you, and he easily transforms you into whatever he wishes ; <lb/> and, in fine, you are the mere possession and plaything of <lb/> Love. And now I know well why you extend your pardon <lb/> to Ixion—inasmuch as you yourself had an intrigue with <lb/> his wife, who presented you with that Peirithous of yours.1</p> 
<p>Zeus. What! Must you be for ever bringing up to mind <lb/> those little trifles—whatever sport I have gone down to <lb/> Earth and enjoyed ? But do you know what I have in my <lb/> mind about Ixion? By no means to punish him, nor to. <lb/> expel him from our table; for that would be an uncourteous <lb/> act. And since he is in love, and as you say, falls to tears, <lb/> and feels unendurable</p>

 afraid you, too, are on the point of saying something im­ <lb/> pertinent.</p> 
<p>Zeus. Not at all. But let us form a phantom out of a <lb/> cloud like your very self, and when the dinner party is <lb/> broken up, and he, as is highly probable, is keeping his <lb/> vigils, under the influence of his passion, let us carry it <lb/> and lay it down by his side. In this way he would cease <lb/> to be plagued; supposing he had had what he wanted.</p> 
<p>Hera. Get away with you. Plague take him for indulg­ <lb/> in- hopes beyond his station.1</p> 
<p>Zeus. Put up with it, however, my dear Hera, for what <lb/> terrible harm could you get from the counterfeit figure, if <lb/> Ixion shall have to do with a mere cloud ?</p> 
<p>Hera. Yes, but I shall be supposed to be the cloud, and <lb/> he will perpetrate upon me his foul purpose, through the <lb/> resemblance.</p> 
<p>Zeus. Your objection is nothing to the purpose. For <lb/> neither will the cloud ever be Hera, nor will you be a <lb/> cloud, while Ixion will only be deceived.</p> 
<p>Hera. But all men are so vulgar-minded and without <lb/> good taste, when he goes down he will, probably, talk big <lb/> and recount to everybody that he has enjoyed the favours <lb/> of Hera, and shared the bed of Zeus; and, maybe, he will <lb/> even assert that I am in love with him; and, not knowing <lb/> it was a cloud he was with, they will believe him.</p> 
<p>Zeus. Then, if he should say anything of the kind, the <lb/> wretch shall be thrown into hell, be bound to a wheel, and <lb/> carried round with it for ever and ever, and shall suffer <lb/> everlasting torture, paying the penalty not of his love-for <lb/> that, surely, is not so dreadful a crime-but of his loud <lb/> boasting.2

<ab><title type="sub"><label>Apollo</label> and <label>Hephaestus</label>.</title></ab>

<p>Hephaestus. Apollo, have you seen Maia's baby, which <lb/> is just born ? What a pretty thing it is, and how it smiles <lb/> on every one, and already plainly shows he is going to turn <lb/> out some great treasure !</p> 
<p>Apollo. That a baby, or a great treasure, who is older <lb/> than Iapetus himself, as far as depends on rascality !</p> 
<p>Hephaestus. And what possible mischief could an infant <lb/> just born be able to do ?</p> 
<p>Apollo. Ask Poseidon, whose trident he stole, or Ares; <lb/> for even from the latter he abstracted his sword from the <lb/> sheath without being found out, not to speak of myself, <lb/> whom he disarmed of my bow and arrows.</p> 
<p>Hephaestus. The new-born brat did this, who hardly keeps <lb/> on his feet, who is still in his long clothes ?</p> 
<p>Apollo. You will know well enough, Hephæstus, if only <lb/> he come near you.</p> 
<p>Hephaestus. Indeed, he already has been near me.</p> 
<p>Apollo. Well, have you all your tools, and is none of <lb/> them missing ?</p> 
<p>Hephaestus. All of them are safe, my dear Apollo.</p> 
<p>Apollo. All the same, examine carefully.</p> 
<p>Hephaestus. By heaven ! I don't see myfire-tongs.</p> 
<p>Apollo. No, but you will probably see them among the <lb/> infant's swaddling clothes.</p> 
<p>Hephaestus. Is he so light-fingered, for all the world as <lb/> though he had mastered the purloining art in his mother's <lb/> womb ?</p> 
<p>Apollo. No wonder you ask, for you have not heard his <lb/> glib and voluble prattling. He is, besides, quite ready to <lb/> wait upon us. And yesterday he challenged Eros, and <lb/> wrestled with him and threw him, somehow tripping up <lb/> his feet. Then, while he was getting praised for it, he <lb/> stole Aphrodite's cestus, as she was folding him to her <lb/> breast on account of his victory; and, while he was laugh­ <lb/> 
<pb n="16"/>
 ing, the sceptre of Zeus, also. And, if the thunder-bolt <lb/> were not a little too heavy, and had a good deal of fire in <lb/> it, he would have filched that too.</p> 
<p>Hephaestus. The child you describe is a regular Gorgon.</p> 
<p>Apollo. Not only so, but already he is a musical genius, <lb/> also.</p> 
<p>Hephaestus. From what can you draw your inference as <lb/> to that ?</p> 
<p>Apollo. Somewhere or other he found a dead tortoise, <lb/> and from it formed a musical instrument: for, having fitted <lb/> in the horns (or side-pieces) and joined them by a bar, he <lb/> next fixed pegs, and inserted a bridge beneath them; and, <lb/> after stretching seven strings upon it, he set about playing <lb/> a very pretty and harmonious tune, so that even I, practised <lb/> as I have long been in playing the cithara,1 envied him. <lb/> And Maia assured us that not even his nights would he <lb/> pass in heaven, but from mere busybodyness be would de­ <lb/> scend as far as Hades, to steal something from thence, I <lb/> suppose. He is furnished with wings, and has made for <lb/> himself a sort of staff2 of wonderful virtue, with which he <lb/> chaperones the souls of dead men, and conducts them <lb/> down to the infernal regions.</p> 
<p>Hephaestus. I gave him that for a plaything.</p> 
<p>Apollo. Then he has paid you back: your fire-tongs</p> 
<p>Hephaestus. Well remembered. So I will march off to <lb/> recover it, if, as you say, it is anywhere to be found among <lb/> his cradle-clothes. 
<note type="footnote"> 1 <foreign xml:lang="grc">Κιθαίζειν</foreign>. The cithara differed somewhat from the lyra and <lb/>
resembled rather the modern guitar. Originally, the lyre had three or <lb/> four strings only: but (650 B.C.) it received the full complement of <lb/> seven strings. From the tortoiseshell material it received its Latin <lb/> name, testudo. See Smith's Diet. of Ant. art. Lyra. </note>

<p>Hermes. A lady of Thebes, one of the daughters of <lb/> Kadmus. He paid her a visit, and made her enceinte.</p> 
<p>Poseidon. Then, did he take her place in the straw,<lb/> Hermes?</p> 
<p>Hermes. Exactly, however strange and paradoxical it <lb/> appears to you. For Hera-you know how jealous she is <lb/> –secretly laid a trap for her, and persuaded her to request <lb/> from Zeus that he would come to her with thunder and<lb/> 
<lb/>
lightning. And when he complied, and came with his<lb/> thunderbolt, the roof of the house was set all on fire, and<lb/> burnt up, and poor Semele perished in the flames. And<lb/> 
<lb/>
he orders me to cut open the lady's womb, and to bring up<lb/> to him the still imperfect embryo of seven months. When<lb/> I had so done, he cuts open his own thigh and inserts it,<lb/> that it might there receive its completion; and now,<lb/> 
<lb/>
exactly in the third month, he has given birth to the child<lb/> and is feeling poorly after the pangs of parturition.</p> 
<p>Poseidon. Where, then, is the baby now?</p> 
<p>Hermes. I took it off to Nysa, and delivered it to the<lb/> Nymphs to bring up, after giving it the name of Dionysus.1</p> 
<p>Poseidon. And is my brother really both father and<lb/> mother of this Dionysus?</p> 
<p>Hermes. So it seems. But I am now off to fetch water <lb/> for his wound, and to perform the other services which <lb/> are customary, just as for a lady after confinement.2

sort of life — I who am the son of Zeus, and have undergone <lb/> so many and great labours, purifying human life, contend­<lb/> ing against and conquering wild beasts, and punishing <lb/> insolent and injurious men; whereas you are a paltry herb-doctor and mountebank,3 skilful, possibly, in palming off <lb/> your miserable drugs upon sick fools, but who have never <lb/> given proof of any noble, manly disposition.</p>

<p>Hera. Fine creatures, indeed, are the children you have <lb/> presented to Zeus, Leto !2</p> 
<p>Leto. It's not all of us, Hera; who can produce such <lb/> progeny as your Hephæstus.</p> 
<p>Hera. But this same cripple is, at all events, of some <lb/> use. He is an excellent workman, and has decorated <lb/> Heaven for us in a thoroughly artistic fashion,3 and he <lb/> married Aphrodite, and is made much of by her ;4 while 
<note type="footnote"> 1 This island of the N. Ægean sea, was the favourite terrestrial abode <lb/>
of Hephæstus, and some authorities place his forge there. </note> 
<note type="footnote"> 2 The abrupt beginning of the Dialogue implies antecedent conver­ <lb/>
sation. The jealous Hera may be supposed to have begun with some <lb/> such ironical observation as " you may well be proud of your good <lb/> looks, or 'you may well be proud of your position among us." The <lb/> relative is sometimes omitted in familiar conversation in Greek as in <lb/> conversational English. </note>

 as for your children, one of them is beyond all measure, <lb/> masculine, and mountainish, and to crown all, has made off <lb/> to Scythia, and everyone knows what her diet is there, <lb/> slaying strangers, and imitating the Scythians themselves, <lb/> who are cannibals.1 As for Apollo, he makes pretence to <lb/> universal knowledge-to shoot with the bow, to play the <lb/> cithara, to be a doctor, and to prophesy-and having set up <lb/> his oracle-shops, one at Delphi, another at Klaros and at <lb/> Didyma, he juggles and cheats those who consult him, <lb/> giving crooked answers,2 and double meanings, applicable <lb/> to either side of the question, so that he runs no risk of <lb/> failure, and from such trickery he makes his fortune : for <lb/> numerous are the fools, and those who offer themselves <lb/> willing victims to be cheated and imposed upon. But by <lb/> the wiser part of men it is not unknown that he is, for the <lb/> most part, a mere juggler in words. The prophet himself, <lb/> at all events, did not know he would kill his favourite <lb/> with the quoit, nor did he divine for his own advantage, <lb/> that Daphne would flee from him ; and that, too, although <lb/> he is so handsome and has such flowing locks. So I don't <lb/> see why you thought you had finer children than poor <lb/> Niobe.3</p> 
<p>Leto. These same children, however-the murderer of <lb/> strangers and the lying prophet—I am well aware how it

As for the miracu­ <lb/> lous metamorphosis of Niobe, Pausanias, who had seen the pillar of <lb/> stone, considers that there need be no difficulty in believing it, for it <lb/> happened in the old times of frequent miraculous interposition of <lb/> Heaven. He is not prepared, however, to maintain that such miracles <lb/> take place in his own day, for man's impiety precludes the possibility. <lb/> Accordingly, he does not credit the received story that the petrified <lb/> Niobe sheds tears, or the popular tales about lycanthropy, or that the <lb/> Tritons blow through their shells, as the vulgar believe (viii. 2). Cf. <lb/> viii. 8. With this expression of pious faith compare, also, the remarks <lb/> of Diodorus (B. 1. iv. 1), who holds that miraculous stories must not <lb/> be inquired into too closely or critically. </note> <lb/>

 vexes you to see them in the company of the gods; and <lb/> especially whenever the one is commended for her beauty, <lb/> and the other performs on his cithara, to the admiration <lb/> of all in the banqueting-hall.</p> 
<p>Hera. I could not help laughing, Leto—he an object of <lb/> admiration, whom, if the Muses had chosen to give a just <lb/> decision, Marsyas would have flayed, as himself the con­ <lb/> queror in the musical contest.1 But, as it was, the poor <lb/> man was overreached, and perished by an unjust doom. <lb/> And, as for your beautiful virgin, she is so beautiful, that, <lb/> when she found she had been seen by Actæon, from fear <lb/> the youth might proclaim her ugliness, she set on him his <lb/> own dogs.2 I don't say all I might, for I omit to dwell on <lb/> the fact, that, if she were really a virgin,3 she could not <lb/> even assist ladies in the straw.</p> 
<p>Leto. You bear yourself superciliously, Hera, because <lb/> you share the bed and throne of Zeus; and for that reason, <lb/> you utter your insults without fear. But, however, I shall <lb/> soon see you in tears again, when he deserts you and goes <lb/> down to earth again in the form of a bull or a swan.

<p>Apollo. Why do you laugh, Hermes ?</p> 
<p>Hermes. Because, my dear Apollo, I have seen the most <lb/> ridiculous sight possible.</p> 
<p>Apollo. Then tell me, that I myself too, when I have <lb/> heard, may be able to join in the laugh.</p> 
<p>Hermes. Aphrodite has been caught with Ares, and. <lb/> Hephæstus has captured and bound them.</p> 
<p>Apollo. How ? For I fancy you are going to tell met <lb/> something pleasant!</p> 
<p>Hermes. For a long time I imagine he had been aware of <lb/> this amour, and was hunting them down ; and when he had <lb/> enveloped their bed with invisible fetters,1 he went back to <lb/> his forge and worked away as usual. Then Ares enters <lb/> unobserved, as he supposed; but Helios looks down upon <lb/> them and sees them, and tells Hephæstus. And when they <lb/> had got upon the bed, and were in each other's arms, and <lb/> were involved within the meshes, the fetters completely <lb/> entangle them, and Hephæstus suddenly comes upon them. <lb/> She, you may be sure, had no means-for in fact she was <lb/> entirely naked-of veiling her shame; while Ares at <lb/> first kept making efforts to escape, and hoped to break the <lb/> bonds ; but afterwards, perceiving himself to be inextricably <lb/> caught,2 he began to act the suppliant.</p> 
<p>Apollo. What then ? Did Hephæstus release them ?</p> 
<p>Hermes. Not at all. On the contrary, summoning all

<p>Apollo. But that blacksmith—does he not himself, too, <lb/> feel shame in exposing the disgrace of his marriage-bed ?</p> 
<p>Hermes. No, by heaven ! not he, who, in fact, stands over <lb/> them and laughs at them. For myself, however, if one <lb/> must speak the truth, I did grudge Ares not only his <lb/> intrigue with the fairest of the Goddesses, but even his <lb/> being bound with her.</p> 
<p>Apollo. Then would you really endure even to be fettered <lb/> upon that condition ?</p> 
<p>Hermes. And would you not, my dear Apollo ? Only <lb/> come and have a look; for I will commend you, if you <lb/> would not yourself, too, pray for the like good fortune, if <lb/> you did but see.3</p>

<p>Zeus. Yet this effeminate mitre-wearer,1 who goes more <lb/> delicately than women, Hera, not only conquered Lydia, <lb/> and took captive the inhabitants of Tmolus, and brought <lb/> the Thracians under his yoke, but also made an expedition <lb/> against the Indians with that army of women, took pos­ <lb/> session of the elephants, and made himself master of the <lb/> country, and led away captive the king who dared to offer <lb/> him a brief resistance; and all this he did while leaping <lb/> about, and dancing with his chorus,2 bearing the ivy­ <lb/> wreathed thyrsus, drunk, as you say, and in bacchanalian <lb/> frenzy. But if anyone attempts to insult him by showing <lb/> contempt for the initiation into his mystic rites,3 he certainly <lb/> avenges himself on him either by binding him with vine­ <lb/> twigs, or by causing him to be torn in pieces by his mother <lb/> like a fawn.4 Do you observe how manly these actions are, <lb/> and not unworthy of his father ? And if playful sportive­ <lb/> ness and wantonness are combined with them, there is no <lb/> cause for grudging them to him; and, especially, if one con­ <lb/> siders what he would be sober, when he performs such <lb/> actions drunk.</p> 
<p>Hera. You appear to me to be going to commend also <lb/> his discovery-the vine and wine-and that, though you <lb/> see how drunkards behave, staggering along, and betaking <lb/> themselves to insolence and violence, and, in a word, mad-

 her eyes burn with a fierce brightness,1 and she is dread­ <lb/> fully masculine. At all events, whenever I advance to­ <lb/> wards her with bent bow, she shakes her crest at me, and <lb/> frightens me out of my wits, and I am all of a tremble, <lb/> and my arrows slip from my hands.</p> 
<p>Aphrodite. Why, was not Ares more alarming ? and yet <lb/> you disarmed him in a moment, and have conquered him.</p> 
<p>Eros. Yes, but he readily allows me to approach him, <lb/> and invites me of his own accord, while Athena is always <lb/> watching me suspiciously and secretly: and once I flew by <lb/> her, casually, with my torch, and said she, " If you come <lb/> near me, by my father, I will run you through in a moment <lb/> with my pretty spear, or I will seize you by the foot and <lb/> pitch you into Tartarus, or tear you in pieces with my own <lb/> hand, and be the death of you." Many such threats has <lb/> she uttered, and she puts on sour looks, and has on her <lb/> breast a frightful sort of face, with snakes all over for hair, <lb/> which is my especial horror, for it frightens me like a very <lb/> Mormo,2 and I flee whenever I catch a glimpse of it.</p> 
<p>Aphrodite. But you fear Athena, as you say, and the <lb/> Gorgon, and that, though you are not afraid of the thunder­ <lb/> bolt of Zeus ! And the Muses-why are they unwounded <lb/> and out of reach of your darts ? Do they, too, shake crests, <lb/> and exhibit Gorgons in front of them ?</p>

<p>Hermes. Some lady of Ida1 appears to be keeping com­ <lb/> pany with him—well enough in her way, but countrified <lb/> and dreadfully boorish. However, he does not seem to be <lb/> excessively attached to her. But, pray, why do you put <lb/> these questions ?</p> 
<p>Aphrodite. I asked quite indifferently.</p> 
<p>Athena. Holloa! you Sir, there, you are exceeding your <lb/> commission in communicating with her in private.</p> 
<p>Hermes. It was nothing extraordinary, Athena, and <lb/> nothing against you. She only asked me if Paris is a <lb/> bachelor.</p> 
<p>Athena. And pray, why is she so inquisitive about that ?</p> 
<p>Hermes. I don't know. But she says it occurred to her <lb/> quite casually, and she had no purpose in asking.</p> 
<p>Athena. Well, is he unmarried ?</p> 
<p>Hermes. I think not.</p> 
<p>Athena. What then ? Has he a desire for the military <lb/> life, and is he at all ambitious for glory, or is he altogether <lb/> devoted to his herds ?</p> 
<p>Hermes. The exact truth I am unable to say: but one <lb/> must suppose that a young fellow like him would be eager <lb/> to acquire fame in these things, and would like to be first <lb/> in fighting.</p> 
<p>Aphrodite (pouting). Do you see ? I don't find fault, nor <lb/> charge you with talking to her on the sly—for such sort of <lb/> querulousness is peculiar to people not over much pleased <lb/> with themselves : it's not Aphrodite's way.</p> 
<p>Hermes. Indeed she asked me almost exactly the same <lb/> question as she did you: so don't be in a pet, and don't <lb/> imagine you are worse treated, if I answered her somewhat <lb/> frankly and simply. But while we are talking, we have <lb/> already advanced far on our road, and taken leave of the <lb/> stars,2 and, in fact, are almost opposite Phrygia. And now, <lb/> in fact, I see Ida and the whole of Gargarus distinctly, and, <lb/> if I am not deceived, Paris himself, your umpire.</p> 
<p>Hera. But where is he ? For he is not visible to my <lb/> eyes.</p>

 the top of the mountain, but along the flank, where the <lb/> cave is; there, where you see the herd.</p> 
<p>Hera. But I don't see the herd.</p> 
<p>Hermes. How ? Do you not see tiny cows in the direc­ <lb/> tion of my finger, so,-advancing from the midst of the <lb/> rocks, and some one running down from the cliff with a <lb/> shepherd's crook, and stopping them from scattering ahead ?</p> 
<p>Hera. Now I see, if it really is he.</p> 
<p>Hermes. But it is. And since we are now so near, let <lb/> us, if you please, settle down on terra firma, and walk, that <lb/> we may not quite disconcert him by flying down all on a <lb/> sudden from the clouds.</p> 
<p>Hera. You are right; so let us do-and now we have <lb/> made our own descent, it is high time for you, Aphrodite, <lb/> to advance and show us the way. For you, as is reason­ <lb/> able to expect, are well acquainted with the locality, <lb/> having frequently, as report goes, come down here to <lb/> Anchises.1</p> 
<p>Aphrodite. These sneers of yours, Hera, don't disturb me <lb/> over much.</p> 
<p>Hermes. Well, I will act as your guide and chaperon; <lb/> for I myself, in fact, passed some time on Ida when Zeus, <lb/> to be sure, was in love with the Phrygian boy ;2 and often <lb/> have I come here, when sent down to look after the child. <lb/> And when, at length, he was mounted on the eagle,3 I flew by <lb/> his side with him, and helped to support my handsome <lb/> charge : and, if I recollect aright, from this rock here he <lb/> snatched him up—for the boy happened to be piping to his <lb/> flock at the moment-and flying down himself, from be­ <lb/> hind,4 Zeus very lightly embraced him in his talons, and, <lb/> grasping his turban with his beak, bore the lad aloft in a <lb/> terrible state of alarm, as he was gazing on his ravisher <lb/> with neck bent backwards. Then, picking up his shep­ <lb/> herd's pipe, for he had let it fall in his fright, I—but excuse

 me, for here is our umpire close at hand: so let us accost <lb/> him.—Good day to you, herdsman.</p> 
<p>Paris. The same to you, young man. But who are you, <lb/> and what is the purpose of your visit to us ? What ladies <lb/> are these you are conducting ?<ref n="1"/> For such town belles <lb/> as they are, they are not fitted for roving over rough <lb/> mountains.</p> 
<p>Hermes. But they are not women, Paris ; but it is Hera, <lb/> and Athena, and Aphrodite you see; and I, I am the God <lb/> Hermes Zeus has sent with them. But why do you <lb/> tremble and turn so pale ? Don't be frightened, for there <lb/> is nothing to be afraid of. He only bids you to be the <lb/> judge of their beauty: "for since," says he, "you are a <lb/> handsome youth yourself, and clever in love-matters, I <lb/> entrust the judgment to you ; and when you have read the <lb/> inscription on the apple, you will know the prize of the <lb/> contest.”</p> 
<p>Paris. Come, let me see what it all means—“ LET THE <lb/> BEAUTIFUL ONE TAKE ME," it says. How, pray, Sir Hermes, <lb/> could I, a mere mortal myself, and a simple peasant, too, <lb/> be a judge of so preternaturally wonderful a spectacle, and <lb/> one too great for a poor herdsman to decide upon ? To <lb/> judge in matters of such importance is rather for delicately­ <lb/> nurtured persons and courtiers : but, for my part, whether <lb/> one she-goat be more beautiful than another she-goat, or <lb/> one heifer surpasses another heifer in beauty I could per­ <lb/> haps decide secundum artem. But these ladies are all <lb/> equally beautiful, and I don't know how a man could <lb/> wrench away his gaze and transfer it from the one to the <lb/> other; for it will not easily unfix itself, but where it first <lb/> rests, to that part it clings, and commends what's imme­ <lb/> diately before it. And even though it pass on to another <lb/> part, that too it sees to be beautiful, and lingers, and is <lb/> caught by the adjoining charms; and, in short, their <lb/> beauty has circumfused itself about me, and wholly taken <lb/> possession of me, and I am vexed that I, too, cannot, like <lb/> Argus, see with all my body. I think I should judge <lb/> fairly, if I give the apple to all: for, indeed, there is this

 difficulty besides ; it happens that this lady is the sister and <lb/> wife of Zeus,1 and that these are his daughters. How, I <lb/> should like to know, is not the decision a hard one from <lb/> this point of view, too ?</p> 
<p>Hermes. I don't know about that: but it's not possible <lb/> to shirk the commands of Zeus, I know.</p> 
<p>Paris. This one thing, Hermes, persuade them to-that <lb/> the two defeated ladies be not angry with me, but. consider <lb/> the error to attach to my eyes alone.</p> 
<p>Hermes. (confers with the Goddesses, apart.) They pro­ <lb/> mise to comply with your request. And now it is high <lb/> time for you to proceed with your judgment.</p> 
<p>Paris. I will do my best endeavours, for how can one <lb/> help it ? But this first I wish to know-will it be quite <lb/> enough to view them as they are, or will it be necessary to <lb/> make them undress for an accurate examination ?</p> 
<p>Hermes. That must be your part as judge to decide. <lb/> Give your orders how and in what way you like.</p> 
<p>Paris. How I like, really ? I wish to see them un­ <lb/> dressed.2</p> 
<p>Hermes. Ho, you ladies there, off with your clothes.3 <lb/> (To Paris.) For your part make a thorough survey-as for <lb/> me, I avert my face at once.</p> 
<p>Hera. Very well said, Paris, and I will be the first to <lb/> undress, that you may perceive that I have not only <lb/> “ white arms," and that I am not proud of having " cow's-eyes" 4 only, but that I am equally and proportionally <lb/> beautiful all over.</p>

<p>Hera. Well, let us undress.</p> 
<p>Paris (expressing, in his features, the utmost admiration). <lb/> O Zeus, worker of miracles! the glorious vision! the <lb/> beauty ! the delight! How superb is the Virgin-Goddess ! <lb/> And how right royally, and with what dignity does this God­ <lb/> dess [Hera] shine in all her splendour ! and how truly right <lb/> worthy of Zeus ! But how sweetly does this Goddess here <lb/> [Aphrodite] look; and what a kind of pretty, seducing smile <lb/> she has !—Well, now I have enough of this felicity—but, <lb/> if it is agreeable, I wish to have a look at each of them sepa­ <lb/> rately, in private ; as, at present, I am really in doubt, and <lb/> don't know on what part to fix my gaze, for my eyes are <lb/> distracted in every direction.</p> 
<p>Aphrodite. Let us do as he wishes.</p> 
<p>Paris. Withdraw then, you two, and do you, Hera, <lb/> remain.</p> 
<p>Hera. I will do so-And, after you have had a good look <lb/> at me, it will be time for you to consider other matters <lb/> besides-whether the gifts at my disposal, in return for your <lb/> vote, do not appear fair to you. For if, my dear Paris, you <lb/> award me the prize of beauty, you shall be lord of all Asia.1</p> 
<p>Paris. Our decision depends not on bribes. Now with­ <lb/> draw, please; for whatever seems proper will have to be­ <lb/> done hereafter. And, now, Athena, do you approach.</p> 
<p>Athena. Here I am at your service. And, in my turn, <lb/> Paris, if you award to me the prize of beauty, you shall <lb/> never come out of battle worsted, but always victorious ; <lb/> for I will make a warrior and a conqueror of you.</p> 
<p>Paris. I don't want war and fighting, Athena; for <lb/> peace, as you see, at present, prevails both in Phrygia and <lb/> in Lydia, and my father's kingdom is free from war. But <lb/> never mind, for you shall not be the worse for it, even <lb/> though we do not give judgment for bribes. Well, now <lb/> put on your clothes again, and replace the helmet on your <lb/> head, for I have seen enough. It is now time for Aphrodite <lb/> to appear.

<p>Aphrodite. Here am I at your elbow, and examine care­ <lb/> fully each part of me, one by one, passing over nothing, <lb/> but dwelling upon every one of my charms; and, if you <lb/> will, my handsome youth, listen to this from me. I have <lb/> reason to ask Tou to do so; for I have long ago observed you <lb/> to be young and good-looking, of such sort, that I doubt if <lb/> all Phrygia supports another like you, and I congratulate <lb/> you on your good looks: but I blame you, that you do not <lb/> leave these lonely cliffs and these rocks, and go and live in <lb/> the city, instead of wasting your sweetness on the desert <lb/> air. For what enjoyment can such as you obtain from the <lb/> mountains ? And what satisfaction can your cows derive <lb/> from your handsome face ? You ought by this time to <lb/> have married-not, however, some hoydenish and rustic <lb/> girl, such as are the women of Ida, but some girl out of <lb/> Hellas, from Argos, or from Korinth, or a Spartan lady, <lb/> such as Helen, young and beautiful, and in no way inferior <lb/> to myself; and, what is, indeed, most to the point, of an <lb/> amorous disposition. For, I tell you, if she were but only <lb/> to see you, she would, I am sure, leave all and give herself <lb/> up soul and body to you, and would follow your fortunes <lb/> and live with you. But, surely, even you have heard <lb/> something of her fame.</p> 
<p>Paris. Not a word, Aphrodite, and I should now be glad <lb/> to hear from you a full account of her.</p> 
<p>Aphrodite. She is the daughter of Leda, the famous <lb/> beauty, to whom Zeus flew down in the shape of a swan.</p> 
<p>Paris. What is she like to look at ?</p>

Pale and fair, as the daughter of a swan <lb/> might be expected to be, and delicate, like one bred in an <lb/> egg; trained naked, for the most part, in the gymnasium, <lb/> and skilled in the art of wrestling.1 And she has been, in <lb/> a manner, so much, indeed, in request that there has even <lb/> been a war on her account, Theseus having run away with

 her when not yet in her teens :1 not, indeed, but that, since <lb/> she arrived at her majority, all the greatest princes of <lb/> the Achæans met together to woo her, and Menelaus, <lb/> of the family of the Pelopidæ, was preferred. If you <lb/> wish it, I say, I will bring about the nuptials for you.</p> 
<p>Paris. What, with a girl already married ?</p> 
<p>Aphrodite. You are young and countrified. I know, <lb/> however, how affairs of this sort are to be managed.</p> 
<p>Paris. How ? For I should like to know, too, myself.</p> 
<p>Aphrodite. You will set out on your travels, as if with <lb/> the purpose of seeing Hellas, and, as soon as ever you <lb/> arrive at Lacedæmon, Helen shall see you; and from that <lb/> moment it would be my business that she shall fall in love, <lb/> and run away with you.</p> 
<p>Paris. That's the very thing that seems to me hard to <lb/> believe-that she should leave her husband, and be ready <lb/> to sail off with a foreigner and a stranger.</p> 
<p>Aphrodite. As far as that's concerned, have no fear, for <lb/> I have two handsome boys, Desire and Love:2 them I will <lb/> give you to be guides of the way; and Love, stealthily as­ <lb/> sailing her with all his might, will compel the lady to fall <lb/> in love, while Desire, shedding his whole influence over <lb/> yourself, will render you what he is himself, an object of <lb/> desire and of love-and I will be present in person to assist <lb/> them. I will request of the Graces, also, to attend you, so <lb/> that all of us together may persuade her.</p>

<p>Ares. Did you hear, Hermes, what threats Zeus uttered <lb/> against us, how arrogant and absurd ? " If I should have <lb/> a mind to it," says he, " I will let down a chain from <lb/> Heaven, and you shall hang on it and use all your force to <lb/> pull me down, but you will labour in vain; for you will <lb/> certainly not drag me down. Whereas should I wish to <lb/> drag it up, not only you but both the Earth and Sea I will <lb/> fasten together and suspend in mid air.”1 And all the <lb/> other menaces, which surely you have heard. Now I, for <lb/> my part, would not deny that he is superior to and stronger <lb/> than any of us taken separately; but that he surpasses so <lb/> many of us together, so that we could not wear him out, <lb/> even though we brought to our aid Earth and Sea—that I <lb/> could not believe.</p>

<p>Pan. I will give you her very own story. Well, when <lb/> she despatched me to Arcadia, “My child," said she, "I <lb/> am your mother, Penelope, of Sparta, and know you have <lb/> a God, Hermes, the son of Maia and Zeus, for your father. <lb/> And if you wear horns, and have the legs of a goat, let not <lb/> that circumstance distress you; for, when your father <lb/> visited me, he gave himself the form of a he-goat, to avoid <lb/> notice, and for that reason you have turned out very like <lb/> that animal.</p> 
<p>Hermes. In truth, I remember to have done something <lb/> of the kind.

<p>Dionysus. There is nothing to be surprised at, Apollo; <lb/> for Aphrodite is not the cause of it, but the different <lb/> fathers. Often, in fact, where the children are by the <lb/> same father, of the same mother, they are, like yourselves, <lb/> the one a male, the other a female.</p>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="1">

<p>Doris. A handsome lover, my dear Galateia, that Sicilian <lb/> shepherd they say is so madly in love with you!</p> 
<p>Galateia. Don't sneer, Doris, for he is Poseidon's son, <lb/> whatever he may be like.</p> 
<p>Doris. What then ? If he were even the son of Zeus <lb/> himself, and showed so savage and uncouth a figure; and, <lb/> most unsightly of all his uglinesses, possessed only one <lb/> eye, do you imagine his birth would at all avail him, in <lb/> comparison with his shape ?</p> 
<p>Galateia. Not even his uncouthness and his savageness <lb/> (as you call it) is without its charm-for it gives him a <lb/> manly air ; and his eye becomes his forehead, and sees not <lb/> less than if there were two.</p> 
<p>Doris. You seem, Galateia, to consider your Polyphemus <lb/> not as the courting, but as the courted, one, such are your <lb/> praises of him.</p> 
<p>Galateia. Courted, no, but I cannot endure that excessive <lb/> proclivity of yours to finding fault, and you others seem to. <lb/> me to do it from envy; because, when, some time ago, he <lb/> was tending his flocks, and had a glimpse of us from his <lb/> cliff, as we were sporting upon the shore, at the foot of <lb/> Ætna, where it extends between the mountain and the sea, <lb/> he did not even look at you others, whereas I appeared to.

 him as the most beautiful of all of us, and so he kept his eye <lb/> upon me alone. It is this that vexes you, for it is a proof <lb/> that I am superior, and deserving to be loved; while you <lb/> other Nymphs have been neglected.</p> 
<p>Doris. If you appear beautiful to the eyes of a keeper of <lb/> sheep and to a fellow who wants an eye, do you suppose you <lb/> are an object of envy ? and, besides, what else had he to <lb/> commend in you than your white skin ? and that, I suppose, <lb/> because he is accustomed to cheese and milk : everything, <lb/> therefore, resembling those things he considers beautiful. 1 <lb/> For as to other charms, whenever you wish to discover <lb/> what you are really like, stoop from some rock, when the <lb/> sea is calm, over the water, and behold yourself to be <lb/> nothing else than an exceedingly white skin ; and that is <lb/> not commended unless, too, there is colour to set it off.</p> 
<p>Galateia. Yet I, so purely white as I am, nevertheless <lb/> have a lover, though it's only he; whereas there is not <lb/> one of you whom either shepherd, or sailor, or boatman <lb/> praises. And my Polyphemus, among other merits, is also <lb/> musical.</p> 
<p>Doris. Hold your tongue, Galateia; we heard his singing, <lb/> when but now he came serenading to you. So may <lb/> Aphrodite be2 my friend, one would have imagined an ass <lb/> was braying. And his very lyre-what a thing it was ! <lb/> The bare skull of a stag, and the horns served as the <lb/> handles,3 and he bridged them, and fitted in the strings, <lb/> without even twisting them round a peg, and then began <lb/> to perform some horribly unmusical and unmelodious <lb/> melody; himself roaring out one thing, and his lyre accom­ <lb/> panying him to something else, so that we could not even <lb/> restrain our laughter at that fine love ditty. Why, Echo <lb/> would not even return any reply to his bellowing, loquacious

 as she is; but was ashamed to appear to imitate his un­ <lb/> couth, ridiculous music. And, then, the amiable creature <lb/> was carrying in his arms, for a plaything, a bear's cub, <lb/> resembling himself in shagginess. Who, pray, would not <lb/> envy you, my Galateia, such a lover ?</p> 
<p>Galateia. Do you then, my dear Doris, show us your own <lb/> adorer, who is, doubtless, handsomer, and more of a <lb/> musician, and better skilled in performing on the cithara.</p> 
<p>Doris. Nay, I have no adorer, nor do I pride myself on <lb/> being admired. But as for your Cyclops, such as he is, <lb/> with the rank odour of a he-goat--a cannibal, as they say, <lb/> and who feeds upon strangers who come to his country­ <lb/> may he be yours and welcome, and may you fully return <lb/> his affection!</p>

<p>Cyclops (blubbering). O father, what have I endured at <lb/> the hands of the cursed stranger, who made me drunk and <lb/> put out my eye, assaulting me when I was lulled to sleep.</p> 
<p>Poseidon. Who dared to do this, my poor Polyphemus ?</p> 
<p>Cyclops. In the first instance, he called himself Outis;2 <lb/> but, when he had got clear away, and was out of reach of <lb/> my arrow, he said that his name was Odysseus.</p> 
<p>Poseidon. I know whom you speak of—him of Ithaka, <lb/> and he was on his return-voyage from Ilium. But how <lb/> did he do it, for he is, by no means, a man of too much <lb/> courage ?</p> 
<p>Cyclops. Returning from my accustomed tending of my <lb/> flocks, I caught a number of fellows in my cave, evidently <lb/> having designs on my herds : for, when I placed the stone <lb/> block against the door-the rock is of huge size-and had <lb/> lighted the fire by igniting the tree which I brought from

 the mountain, evidently they appeared to be trying to conceal <lb/> themselves. Well, when I had got hold of some of them, <lb/> I devoured them for a pack of thieves, as was reasonable. <lb/> Hereupon that most villainous rascal, whether he was Outis <lb/> or Odysseus, pours out a sort of drug and gives me to <lb/> drink-sweet, indeed, and of delicious smell, but most <lb/> insidious, and which caused great disorder in my head: <lb/> for immediately upon my drinking everything seemed to <lb/> me to be in a whirl, and the cave itself was turned upside <lb/> down, and I was no longer at all in my senses ; and, at last, <lb/> I was dragged down into sleep. Then sharpening the bar, <lb/> and igniting it besides, he blinded me as I slept, and from <lb/> that time, I am a blind man, at your service, Poseidon.</p> 
<p>Poseidon. How soundly you slept, my son, that you did <lb/> not jump up while you were being blinded ! But as for <lb/> this Odysseus, then, how did he escape ? For he could not <lb/> —I am well assured that he could not-move away the <lb/> rock from the door.</p> 
<p>Cyclops. Yes, but it was I who removed it, that I might <lb/> the better catch him as he was going out; and, sitting <lb/> down close to the door, I groped for him with extended <lb/> hands, letting only ray sheep pass out. to pasture, after <lb/> having given instructions to the ram what he was to do in <lb/> my place.</p> 
<p>Poseidon. I understand, they slipped away under them <lb/> unnoticed. But you ought to have shouted, and called the <lb/> rest of the Cyclopes to your aid against him.</p> 
<p>Cyclops. I did summon them, father, and they came. <lb/> But when they asked the sneaking rascal's name, and I <lb/> said it was Outis, thinking I was in a mad fit, they took <lb/> themselves off at once. Thus the cursed fellow tricked me <lb/> with his name; and what especially vexes me is, that <lb/> actually throwing my misfortune in my teeth, " Not even," <lb/> says he, " will your father Poseidon cure you." 1

<ab><title type="sub"><label>Poseidon</label> and <label>Alpheius</label>.1</title></ab>

<p>Poseidon. What's this, Alpheius ? Of all rivers you are <lb/> the only one that falls into the sea without mingling with <lb/> the salt water, as is the custom of other streams, nor do <lb/> you rest from pouring yourself along; but, in your passage <lb/> through the sea, contracting and keeping sweet your <lb/> waters, still unmixed and pure, you hasten I know not <lb/> where, diving into the depths, like the sea-gulls and <lb/> herons ; and yet you seem to be ready to pop up some­ <lb/> where or other, and again discover yourself.</p> 
<p>Alpheius. Something of a love-affair, Poseidon, so don't <lb/> scold. Even you yourself often have been in love.</p> 
<p>Poseidon. Is it a woman or a Nymph, or, indeed, one of <lb/> the Nereids themselves you are in love with ?</p> 
<p>Alpheius. No, but with a Fountain, Poseidon.</p> 
<p>Poseidon. And she—where in the world does she flow ?</p> 
<p>Alpheius. She is a Sicilian islander. They call her <lb/> Arethusa.</p> 
<p>Poseidon. I am aware, Alpheius, she is no ugly creature­ <lb/> this Arethusa. On the contrary, she is beautifully clear <lb/> and transparent, and gushes out in a pure stream, and the

The mysterious river empties <lb/> itself into the Ionian Sea, not far from Olympia, in Elis. According to <lb/> the myth, the nymph Arethusa, one of the Nereids beloved by the <lb/> river-god, was pursued by him until she was transformed by Artemis <lb/> into the Sicilian fountain.

 water gives beauty to the pebbles, showing all silver above <lb/> them.</p> 
<p>Alpheius. How accurately well you know the Fountain, <lb/> Poseidon ! I am now off to her side.</p> 
<p>Poseidon. Well, away then, and good luck to you in your <lb/> wooing. But tell me this, where did you have a sight of <lb/> your Arethusa, seeing that you yourself are Arcadian, and <lb/> she is at Syracuse ?</p> 
<p>Alpheius. You are detaining me, in haste as I am, with <lb/> your superfluous questions.</p> 
<p>Poseidon. You are right. Away to your beloved, and <lb/> emerging from the sea, mingle harmoniously with your <lb/> Fountain, and become one water.</p>

<p>Menelaus. Well, that you become water, Proteus, is not <lb/> incredible, seeing you belong to the sea; and that you <lb/> become a tree, too, may pass—nay, when you get changed <lb/> into a lion, yet even that is not beyond my powers of <lb/> belief. But whether it is possible for you to become fire <lb/> while living in the sea—that I very much wonder at and <lb/> doubt.</p> 
<p>Proteus. Don't wonder, my dear Sir, for I do become <lb/> such.</p> 
<p>Menelaus. I, indeed, saw it with my own eyes. But <lb/> you appear to me—for I must confess it to you—to apply <lb/> some kind of jugglery to the business, and to deceive the <lb/> eyes of the spectators, while yourself become nothing of <lb/> the sort.

<p>Proteus. And what deception could there be in a case so <lb/> clear ? Did you not with open eyes see into what I <lb/> transfigured myself ? 1 And if you doubt, and the thing <lb/> seem to you to be unreal, a sort of phantasmagoria placed <lb/> before your eyes, when I become fire, give me your hand, <lb/> my excellent Sir : for you shall know whether I am a <lb/> mere spectral illusion, or whether, in fact, the property of <lb/> burning then belongs to me.</p> 
<p>Menelaus. The experiment is scarcely a safe one, Sir <lb/> Proteus.</p> 
<p>Proteus. But you seem to me never to have seen the <lb/> polypus even, or to know what are the peculiarities of <lb/> that creature of the sea.2</p> 
<p>Menelaus. Yes, I have seen the polypus ; but what are <lb/> its peculiarities I should be glad to learn from you.</p> 
<p>Proteus. Whatever rock it approaches and fastens its <lb/> suckers on, and hangs clinging to in coils, to that it assimilates <lb/> itself ; and it changes its colour in mimicry of the rock, so <lb/> that it may escape the notice of the fishermen, being thus <lb/> not at all different, or conspicuous, but closely resembling <lb/> the stone.</p> 
<p>Menelaus. So they say. But your case is far more <lb/> strange, my friend Proteus.</p> 
<p>Proteus. I don't know, Menelaus, whom else you would <lb/> believe, if you don't believe your own eyes.</p> 
<p>Menelaus. Since I saw it, I saw it, it is true ; but the <lb/> thing is miraculous-the same person to become both fire <lb/> and water!

And it was inscribed : " Let <lb/> the beautiful one have me." And rolling along, as though <lb/> intentionally, it came where Hera and Aphrodite and <lb/> Athena were reclining; and when Hermes, taking it up, <lb/> read out the inscription, we Nereids held our tongues, <lb/> for what were we to do, in the presence of those Goddesses ? <lb/> Then they began to put forward each one her pretensions, <lb/> and each claimed the apple to be her own.

<p>Zephyrus. Never did I see a more magnificent Proces­ <lb/> sion on the sea, since I was born, and began to blow. But <lb/> you—did you not see it, Notus ?</p> 
<p>Notus. What is this Procession you talk of, Zephyrus, <lb/> or who were the Processionists ?</p> 
<p>Zephyrus. You have missed a most delicious spectacle, <lb/> the like of which you may never see again.</p> 
<p>Notus. Yes, for I was employed in the neighbourhood of <lb/> the Red Sea, and, indeed, I blow over part of India, as <lb/> much of the country as stretches along the sea-coast. <lb/> I know, therefore, nothing of what you speak of.</p> 
<p>Zephyrus. But you know Agenor of Sidon ?</p> 
<p>Notus. Yes, the father of Europa. 1 What then ?</p> 
<p>Zephyrus. It is about herself I will relate to you a story.</p> 
<p>Notus. It is not, is it, that Zeus has been for a long time <lb/> the girl's lover ? For that I knew quite a long while ago.</p> 
<p>Zephyrus. You are, then, aware of the amour. But listen <lb/> now to the sequel. Europa had gone down to the shore <lb/> in sportive mood, taking with her companions of her own 
<note type="footnote"> 1 See Ov. Metam. ii. 14, in. 1, and the charming Idyll of Moschus, <lb/>
entitled <foreign xml:lang="grc">Εὐμώπη</foreign>. Herodotus, at the beginning of his Histories, among <lb/> the numerous rapes of European and Asiatic women perpetrated by the <lb/> two races, one upon the other, which he assigns as the original cause of <lb/> the enmity between them, recounts that of Europa, whom he alleges to <lb/> have been carried off by Greek traders : a more probable explanation of <lb/> a Greek myth than many of the solutions of the old historian—<foreign xml:lang="grc">χρονὶων <lb/> ὂζων καὶ βεκκέσεληνοϚ</foreign>. Palaephatus, in his accustomed rationalising <lb/> spirit, discredits the miracle. “ I believe," he affirms, " that neither a <lb/> bull nor a horse could swim so great a space of sea ; nor do I believe <lb/> that a girl would mount a fierce bull; and Zeus, if he wished to bring <lb/> Europa to Krete, would have found for her a pleasanter way of travel­ <lb/> ling." The bull, in fact, he resolves into the less prodigious human <lb/> ravisher, whose name he supposes to have been Tauros. </note> <lb/>

 age. And Zeus, making himself like a bull, began to <lb/> sport with them, seeming a very handsome creature, for he <lb/> was perfectly white, and had beautifully crumpled horns, <lb/> and was tame and quiet in look. He began, then, as he was, <lb/> to frolic about upon the shore, and to bellow most sweetly; <lb/> so that Europa ventured even to mount him. And, as soon <lb/> as this was done, Zeus started off with her at a running pace <lb/> towards the sea ; and, plunging in, began to swim. But <lb/> she, very much terrified at the occurrence, with her left <lb/> hand kept clinging to his horn, that she might not slip off, <lb/> while with the other she held together her long flowing <lb/> dress, 1 blown about by the wind.</p> 
<p>Notus. That was a charming spectacle, Zephyrus, you <lb/> witnessed, and an amorous—Zeus swimming, carrying <lb/> his beloved.</p> 
<p>Zephyrus. Yet what followed was far more delightful, <lb/> Notus. For the sea from that moment was without a <lb/> ripple, and, attracting a perfect calm, showed itself smooth <lb/> and unruffled. We, however, keeping quiet, followed, <lb/> being no more than mere spectators of what was hap­ <lb/> pening : and the Loves, hovering a little above the sea, <lb/> so as at times to graze the water with the tips of their <lb/> feet, with lighted torches, sang together the hymeneal <lb/> song: while the Nereids, emerging from the sea, rode by <lb/> their side upon dolphins, clapping their hands, most of them <lb/> half-naked.2 Then, too, the whole tribe of Tritons, and <lb/> whatever else of the sea-dwellers is not terrible to the <lb/> sight-all led their dances round the girl. Poseidon, <lb/> indeed, mounting upon his chariot, and with Amphitrite <lb/> riding at his side, led the way with hilarity, clearing the <lb/> way for his swimming brother. To crown all, two Tritons <lb/> were bearing Aphrodite, who reclined upon a shell, and

<note type="footnote"> 2 Menippus, who figures so conspicuously in these Dialogues, was a <lb/>
countryman of Lucian, born at Gadara, in Hollow Syria, in the first <lb/> century B.C. He belonged to the Cynic sect, and by his satirical <lb/> writings is one of the most famous of that school: but his cynicism did <lb/> not prevent him from making an extensive fortune in trade as a banker, <lb/> which he lost by the bad faith of a trusted friend. He then put an end <lb/> to his life. His Satires are known to us only through the fragments of <lb/> the Suturæ Menippeæ of Varro (his contemporary), the learned Latin <lb/> antiquarian : one of the best of which is the Prometheus Liber. Cicero <lb/> (Quæst. Academ.) alludes to the Menippean Satires as displaying pro­ <lb/> found philosophy as well as wit. Marcus Aurelius (<foreign xml:lang="grc">Τά εἰϚ'Εαυτὸν</foreign>) <lb/> especially mentions him as a distinguished mocker of human life <lb/> (<foreign xml:lang="grc">χλευαστήϚ</foreign>).

For there your laughter was yet questionable, and <lb/> frequent was the objection,2 but who knows altogether what <lb/> is to come after life ? But here you will not cease laughing <lb/> on firm grounds, as I do now, and most of all when you <lb/> see the rich, and viceroys, and princes to be so humble and <lb/> obscure, and distinguishable by their lamentations alone, <lb/> and that they are soft-hearted and mean-spirited, recollect­ <lb/> ing their life above." This tell him, and, further, to come <lb/> with his scrip filled with a quantity of lupines; and, if he any­ <lb/> where find on the cross-roads a supper for Hekate set out, or <lb/> a purificatory egg,3 or anything of the sort, let him bring it.</p> 
<p>Polydeukes. Well, I will give this message, Diogenes. <lb/> But describe him, that I may know quite certainly what <lb/> manner of man he is as to looks.</p> 
<p>Diogenes. An old fellow, bald, with a little old cloak, 4 <lb/> with many a hole in it, exposed to every wind of heaven, <lb/> and variegated with rags and tatters ; 5 and he is for ever <lb/> laughing, and, for the most part, jeers at those loud­ <lb/> talking philosophers.</p>

<p>Diogenes. Are you willing that I give you some commis­ <lb/> sion with respect to those philosophers themselves ?</p> 
<p>Polydeukes. Speak: for that will not be any trouble <lb/> either.</p> 
<p>Diogenes. In a word, then, exhort them to cease their <lb/> trifling nonsense, and quarrelling about the nature of the <lb/> universe, and generating " horns " for each other, and <lb/> making " crocodiles," 1 and teaching the young to engage <lb/> in such futile rubbish.</p> 
<p>Polydeukes. But they will say that I am an ignorant and <lb/> uneducated fellow to denounce their philosophy.</p> 
<p>Diogenes. Do you, however, bid them from me to go and <lb/> howl with a plague to them.</p> 
<p>Polydeukes. This message, too, I will give them, Diogenes.</p> 
<p>Diogenes. And to the rich, my dearest pet of a Poly­ <lb/> deukes, convey this message from me: " Why, O fools, do <lb/> you guard your gold so religiously; and why do you punish <lb/> yourselves, calculating the interest of your money, and <lb/> heaping talents upon talents, who must shortly come hither <lb/> with only a single obolus ?

From this has been supposed <lb/> (but, probably, without reason) to be derived the proverb of reproach­ <lb/> " to wear the horns." As for the syllogism of the " crocodile," it <lb/> derived its name from the following illustration :-A crocodile seizes a <lb/> child on the banks of a river, and promises to restore it to the father if <lb/> he can tell truly whether the child will be given back or no.

<p>Diogenes. And to the poor, Mr. Laconian 3—and they are <lb/> numerous enough, grieving at their lot, and bewailing <lb/> their destitution-say that they are not to weep or lament; <lb/> explain to them the perfect equality here; and that they <lb/> will see those who are rich there (in the upper world) in <lb/> no way better off than themselves. And your Lacede­ <lb/> monians reprove from me for this, if you like-telling them <lb/> that they have become remiss and degenerate.</p> 
<p>Polydeukes. Not a word, Diogenes, about the Lacede­ <lb/> monians, for I certainly will not tolerate it. But as to what <lb/> you were saying in regard to the rest, I will deliver your <lb/> messages.</p> 
<p>Diogenes. Let us leave them alone, since such is your <lb/> pleasure : do you, however, convey from me my words to <lb/> those whom I before mentioned.

<p>Hermes. They will suffer a ridiculous fate, rascals that <lb/> they are.

<p>Pluto. Very just, certainly, Terpsion, since he does not <lb/> pass his life praying for the death of any of his friends, <lb/> while you the whole time were plotting against him, and <lb/> expecting his legacy.</p> 
<p>Terpsion. Why, was it not fitting, old as he was, and no <lb/> longer capable of using his wealth, he had departed from <lb/> life and made way for the young ?</p>

<p>Pluto. These things, Terpsion, are much more reason­ <lb/> able than they seem to you to be. And you—what pos­ <lb/> sesses you that you gape with open mouth after other <lb/> people's possessions, and thrust and force yourselves upon <lb/> childless old fellows ? Thus it is you incur ridicule, when <lb/> you are laid under ground before them; and the matter <lb/> affords the greatest delight to most people, for, in pro­ <lb/> portion as you pray for their deaths is it a pleasure to all <lb/> that you predecease them. Why, this is some new and <lb/> strange art you have devised-to make love to old men and <lb/> old women, most especially if they have no children ; while <lb/> those who are blessed with progeny have no lovers, as far <lb/> as you are concerned.

<p>Zenophantes. The childless millionaire, with whom I <lb/> knew you as chiefly familiar ?</p> 
<p>Kallidemides. That's the very man I was always courting, <lb/> who promised that he would speedily depart this life for <lb/> my special benefit. When, however, the business was being <lb/> protracted to an unconscionable length, and the old fellow <lb/> was extending his life beyond the age of Tithonus 1 himself, <lb/> I devised an expeditious sort of road to the inheritance. <lb/> Purchasing a poison, I induced his butler, as soon as ever <lb/> Ptoeodorus asked to drink-and he drinks pretty hard-to <lb/> put it in his cup and have it ready to give to him ; and, if <lb/> he would do so, I pledged myself by oath to give him his <lb/> freedom.</p> 
<p>Zenophantes. What happened then ? For you seem to <lb/> be going to tell some very strange story.</p> 
<p>Kallidemides. Well, when we had come from the bath, <lb/> the lad with the two cups all ready, the one having the <lb/> poison for Ptoeodorus, and the other for me—by some <lb/> blunder gave me the poison, and Ptoeodorus the unpoisoned <lb/> goblet. Accordingly he drank his harmlessly, while in a <lb/> moment I lay an outstretched corpse, substituted in his <lb/> place.- Why do you laugh at this, Zenophantes ? Surely it <lb/> does not beseem you to mock at a gentleman and a friend.</p> 
<p>Zenophantes (laughing immoderately). Why, my friend <lb/> Kallidemides, you experienced a comical sort of fate. But <lb/> the old gentleman, what did he at this?</p>

<p>Charon. Just hear a moment how matters stand with us. <lb/> Our little craft, as you observe, is a small one, and it is <lb/> somewhat rotten, and leaks in most parts ; and, were it to <lb/> incline to either side, it would completely overturn and go <lb/> to the bottom ; and yet you come crowding together at <lb/> the same time, each of you carrying a lot of luggage.

<p>Dead Men. What shall we do, then, to secure a safe <lb/> passage ?</p> 
<p>Charon. I will tell you. You must embark stripped of <lb/> everything, and leave all these superfluous things upon <lb/> the shore : for scarcely even so will the ferry-boat receive <lb/> you.—But it will be your care, Hermes, from this moment, <lb/> to receive none of them who should not come in light <lb/> marching order, and throw away, as I said, his furniture <lb/> and movable property. Now, take your stand near the

<p>Hermes. So, then, pray, off with your good looks and your <lb/> lips with their kisses and all, and that long, flowing hair,2 <lb/> and the blush on your cheeks, and your entire hide. 'Tis <lb/> well; you are now succinctly equipped : come on board now. <lb/> -And you there, the gentleman with the purple robe and the <lb/> diadem, you with the grim countenance-who may you be?</p>

<p>Hermes. Why, pray, Lampichus, are you here with so <lb/> many valuables?</p> 
<p>Lampichus. What, then ? Ought a prince to come stripped <lb/> of everything ?</p>

<p>Philosopher. Why, you, Menippus, are you not grieved at being dead ?</p> 
<p>Menippus. How? I, who hurried to death without anyone’s summons?1 But, while we are chattering, is that not some cry I hear as if of people shouting from Earth?</p> 
<p>Hermes. Yes, Menippus, not from one region only ; but those who have met together in conclave, with pleased looks, are all laughing at the death of Lampichus, while his wife is seized hold of by the women, and her infants likewise, young and tender as they are, are being assailed by the boys with quantities of stones; and others are applauding Diophantus, the orator, at Sicyon, who is declaiming funeral eulogies over Kraton here—and, by heaven, the mother of Damasias, with wailing, is now leading off the dirge for him with the women. But as for you, friend Menippus, no one sheds a tear over you, and you lie all alone in perfect peace.</p>

<p>Krates. You used, Diogenes, to know Moerichus, the <lb/> rich fellow, the millionaire—him of Korinth, who owned <lb/> those numerous merchant-ships; whose cousin was Arts­ <lb/> teas, himself, too, a plutocrat, who used to quote that <lb/> verse of Homer :— <lb/> " Let one or other lift his man." 2</p> 
<p>Diogenes. Why, Krates ?</p> 
<p>Krates. They used to court and wheedle one the other <lb/> for the sake of the expected legacy (being of the same age), <lb/> and publicly registered their wills ; Moerichus, if he should <lb/> die first, leaving Aristeas master of all his property, and <lb/> Aristeas Moerichus, should he predecease the other.

His wife, Hipparchia, who <lb/> belonged to an aristocratic family, had united her fate with his, in spite <lb/> of great opposition from her friends 5 and even declared her resolve to kill <lb/> herself, if they refused consent.

 were the terms of the wills ; while they were accustomed <lb/> to surpass one the other in their mutual wheedling and <lb/> flattery. The prophets, both those who divine the future <lb/> from the stars, and those who divine from dreams, like the <lb/> disciples of the Chaldæans—nay, even the Pythian himself <lb/> -offered the victory now to Aristeas, now to Moerichus ; <lb/> and the scales were for inclining at one time in favour of <lb/> the latter, and now again for the former.</p> 
<p>Diogenes. What, pray, was the end of it, Krates ? For <lb/> it is worth hearing.</p> 
<p>Krates. Both have died on one and the same day, and <lb/> the properties devolved unexpectedly upon Eunomius and <lb/> Thrasykles—both relatives-who never even dreamed that <lb/> this would happen. For, sailing across from Sikyon to <lb/> Kirrha,1 about the middle of the passage, they were over­ <lb/> taken by the west-north-west wind across their bows, and <lb/> they were wrecked and lost.</p> 
<p>Diogenes. It was very kind of them. Well, as for us, <lb/> when we were in life, we entertained no such designs in <lb/> regard to one another ; neither did I ever pray for the <lb/> death of Antisthenes, that I might inherit his staff—and <lb/> he used to have a pretty strong one, which he made for <lb/> himself of wild olive; 2 nor, I imagine, did you, Krates, <lb/> eagerly desire to inherit my possessions at my death—my <lb/> tub and my wallet, which held two quarts of lupines.</p> 
<p>Krates. No, for I had no need of them ; neither had <lb/> you, Diogenes : for what we needed, you inherited from <lb/> Antisthenes, and I from you, possessions far better and <lb/> more respectable than all the power of the Persians.</p> 
<p>Diogenes. What are these possessions you speak of ?</p> 
<p>Krates. Wisdom, self-sufficiency, truth, plain-speaking, <lb/> freedom.</p> 
<p>Diogenes. By my faith, yes. I remember also, that, <lb/> having received this wealth in succession from Antisthenes, <lb/> I left behind to you, in fact, still more.

<p>Krates. However, the rest of the world used to despise <lb/> such kind of possessions, and no one of them courted us, <lb/> looking to obtain our legacies ; but they all directed their <lb/> looks to the gold coin.</p> 
<p>Diogenes. With good reason; for they had not where <lb/> they could receive from us and stow away such possessions, <lb/> gradually leaking and wasting away, as they were, under <lb/> the influence of luxury, like rotten pouches. So that, if <lb/> even one were to put into them either wisdom, or plainness <lb/> of speech, or truth, it would immediately escape and run <lb/> through, the bottom of the vessel not being able to hold it <lb/> in; something like what the daughters of Danaus, those <lb/> famous maidens, experience when they draw water in their <lb/> perforated pitcher : while as for the gold, they used to <lb/> guard it with tooth and nail, and every possible con­ <lb/> trivance.</p>

Now, <lb/> I affirm that those men are most deserving of eulogy, <lb/> who, though nothing at starting, none the less arrived at <lb/> great eminence, by their own efforts investing themselves <lb/> with power, and being deemed worthy of governing. <lb/> Well, though I set out with few soldiers for Spain, at first <lb/> being subordinate to my brother, I was judged to be the <lb/> most skilful in war, and was deemed fit for the highest <lb/> employments; and I subdued the Keltiberians, and con­ <lb/> quered the Gauls of the West; and, crossing the vast moun­ <lb/> tains, 3 I overran all the plains of the Padus, and laid in <lb/> ruins so many cities, and subjected to my power the whole <lb/> plain of Italy, and advanced as far as the suburbs of its <lb/> Capital city, and slew such numbers on one day that I <lb/> measured off their rings by bushels,4 and bridged their <lb/> rivers with the dead. And all this I accomplished with­ <lb/> out either getting myself called the son of Ammon, or

Alexander, on <lb/> the other hand, enlarged a dominion which he had re­ <lb/> ceived from his father, and extended it considerably by <lb/> availing himself of the start given him by Fortune. But, <lb/> when he had gained the victory over and vanquished at <lb/> Issus and Arbela2 that wretched pest Dareius, revolting <lb/> from the customs of his ancestors, he began to put forth <lb/> claims to divine -worship, and changed his way of life to <lb/> the Median mode ; and polluted his hands in the blood of <lb/> his friends at his banquets, and seized them for the pur­ <lb/> pose of putting them to death.3 Whereas I ruled my <lb/> country upon terms of equality with my fellow-citizens, and <lb/> when it summoned me to its aid, on the sailing of the <lb/> enemy to Libya with a great armament, I obeyed with

From that time, Minos, <lb/> you know how many dead I sent below to you on one day; <lb/> at all events, the Ferryman says that his boat did not <lb/> suffice, at that time, for them, but that the majority of them <lb/> constructed rafts for themselves, and so made the passage. <lb/> And this I accomplished by being foremost in danger <lb/> myself, and deeming it glorious to get myself wounded. <lb/> Not to recount to you my exploits at Tyre, or at Arbela, <lb/> not only all that, but I advanced as far as the Indians, and <lb/> made for myself the Ocean the boundary of my empire ; <lb/> and I captured their elephants, and worsted Porus. And <lb/> as for the Scythians, not a people to be despised with <lb/> impunity, I crossed the Don and conquered them in a <lb/> great cavalry battle. And I conferred benefits on my <lb/> friends, and avenged myself on my enemies; and, if I <lb/> appeared to men to be indeed divine, they are to be excused, <lb/> in consideration of the greatness of my actions, for believing <lb/> something of the kind about me. Finally, I died while <lb/> yet a king, whereas this fellow died in exile at the court <lb/> of Prusias of Bithynia, as it was right a man of the greatest <lb/> villainy and cruelty should. For how he conquered the <lb/> Italians I omit to say-that he did not do it by force, but <lb/> by corruption, and not keeping faith,1 and by stratagems ; <lb/> nothing according to the usages of war or above-board. <lb/> And, as for his reproaching me with luxury, I think he has <lb/> forgotten entirely what he was accustomed to do in Capua, <lb/> living with ladies of the demi-monde, and, admirable General, <lb/> wasting in pleasures the opportunities of war.

No; those parts of the world seemed to <lb/> me not worth fighting for, being already cowed and <lb/> acknowledging a master. I have said. Now do you, <lb/> Minos, judge; for, out of many facts, these are quite <lb/> enough to decide by.</p> 
<p>Scipio. Not before you have heard me, too.</p> 
<p>Minos. Why, who are you, my fine Sir ? or as what <lb/> countryman will you speak ?</p> 
<p>Scipio. An Italian; 1 Scipio, the general who razed <lb/> Carthage, and conquered the Libyans in great battles.</p> 
<p>Minos. What, pray, would you say ?</p> 
<p>Scipio. That I am inferior, indeed, to Alexander, but <lb/> superior to Hannibal—I who vanquished and pursued him, <lb/> and forced him to a disgraceful flight. How, then, is this <lb/> fellow not ashamed to contend in rivalry with Alexander, <lb/> with whom not even I, Scipio, his conqueror, claim to put <lb/> myself in comparison ?</p> 
<p>Minos. By my faith, you speak the words of reason, <lb/> Scipio; so let Alexander be judged to be first, next to him <lb/> come you; then, by your leave, follows Hannibal third; <lb/> for neither is he to be despised with impunity.2

<p>Alexander. Philip's undoubtedly; for had I been <lb/> Ammon's, I should not have died.</p>

 then you were born from such intercourse, and that Philip <lb/> was altogether deceived in supposing you were of his <lb/> begetting.</p> 
<p>Alexander. I, too, like you, used to hear these tales ; but <lb/> now I see that neither my mother nor the Ammonian <lb/> prophets spoke at all rationally.</p> 
<p>Diogenes. But their lie was not unserviceable to you, <lb/> Alexander, in regard to your exploits ; for many were <lb/> cowed, under the impression that you were a God. But, <lb/> tell me, to whom have you. left behind this so great empire <lb/> of yours ?</p> 
<p>Alexander. I don't know, Diogenes ; for I had not made <lb/> any arrangements about it beforehand, or only this much <lb/> -that on my death-bed I gave over my ring to Per­ <lb/> dikkas.1 But, however, why do you laugh, Diogenes ?</p> 
<p>Diogenes. Why, at what else than the recollection of the <lb/> doings of Hellas, that servilely flattered you, who had but <lb/> just succeeded to the throne, and elected you to the hege­ <lb/> mony and command-in-chief against the foreigners. And <lb/> some even added you to the twelve principal deities,2 both <lb/> building to you temples and sacrificing to you as to a <lb/> Serpent's son ! But, tell me, where did the Macedonians <lb/> bury you ?</p> 
<p>Alexander. I am still lying in Babylon, after three days, <lb/> unburied; but Ptolemæus, of my foot-guards, promises, if <lb/> ever he has leisure from the troubles immediately before <lb/> him, to carry me away to Egypt and bury me there, so that <lb/> I may become one of the Egyptian divinities.

But, <lb/> however, don't for a moment expect it, most respectable of <lb/> godships; for it is not allowed to any of those who have <lb/> once crossed the Lake, and passed within this side of the <lb/> mouth of the Cavern, to go back up to Earth.

But, <lb/> however, this benefit I have gained from his philosophy <lb/> -to be grieved at the loss of those things as the greatest <lb/> “goods,” which you but just now enumerated.1</p>

 afraid of you ? But tell me, in the name of your own <lb/> Herakles—when he was alive, did you associate with him <lb/> at that time as his ghost; or, were you one and the same <lb/> during your life, and, when you died, did you separate and <lb/> did he fly off to heaven, and you, the ghost, as was natural, <lb/> come to Hades ?</p> 
<p>Herakles. I ought not even to have replied to a man who <lb/> talks thus lightly. However, pray, just hear this, too. As <lb/> much as there was of Amphitryon in Herakles,1 that has <lb/> died, and I am all that; but what there was of Zeus is <lb/> living with the Gods in heaven.</p> 
<p>Diogenes. Now I clearly understand. For Alkmene gave <lb/> birth, you imply, to two Herakleses at the same time-the <lb/> one by Amphitryon, and the other from Zeus; so that, with­ <lb/> out its being known, you were twins, born of the same <lb/> mother.</p> 
<p>Herakles. No, vain trifler: why, we both were one and <lb/> the same person.</p> 
<p>Diogenes. It's not so easy to understand this-that there <lb/> were two Herakleses compounded into one-excepting, per­ <lb/> haps, in the manner, as it were, of some hippo centaur, you <lb/> had grown together, man and god.</p> 
<p>Herakles. What! don't you suppose all men to be so com­ <lb/> posed of two parts-soul and body ? So what is to hinder <lb/> the soul from being in heaven, which was from Zeus, and <lb/> the mortal part-myself-from being with the dead ?</p> 
<p>Diogenes. Nay, most excellent son of Amphitryon, you <lb/> would have fairly advanced that argument if you were a <lb/> body; but now you are a bodiless ghost. So you are <lb/> perilously near making Herakles just now into a trinity.</p> 
<p>Herakles. How a trinity ?</p> 
<p>Diogenes. In this way about. If the one, whoever it is,. <lb/> is in heaven, and the one who is with us are you the ghost, <lb/> while your body has already been dissolved and become <lb/> dust on Æta,2 these surely are three. And consider, there­ <lb/> fore, whom you will devise for the third parent for your <lb/> body.3</p>

My friend Kerberus-for I am your kinsman, <lb/> being myself a dog, too,1—tell me, in the name of the Styx, <lb/> what was Sokrates like when he was coming down to us : <lb/> it is to be expected that you, as you are divine, not only <lb/> bark but also utter human sounds whenever you have a <lb/> mind to do so.</p> 
<p>Kerberus. At a distance, Menippus, he appeared, in every <lb/> way, to be approaching with undisturbed countenance, <lb/> seeming to fear death in no great degree, and desirous to <lb/> make this evident to those who stood outside the entrance. <lb/> But when be stooped down and peered within the yawning <lb/> cavern, and saw the darkness, and when I gave him a bite <lb/> as he was long dallying with the hemlock,2 and dragged <lb/> him down by the foot, he began to squall like an infant, and <lb/> to bewail his little children, and to take all possible forms <lb/> in his terros.3</p> 
<p>Menippus. Was then the fellow a mere sophist? and did <lb/> he not, in fact, have contempt for the event of death ?</p> 
<p>Kerberus. No, he had not; but when, in fact, he saw

Kerberus, like most of the monsters of Hellenic fancyor Mediæval supersti­ <lb/> tion, was, chimæra-like, a compound of do- and serpent-the reptile part <lb/> of the monster adorning its back and forming its tail. See Apollod. ii. <lb/> 5, 12. The Do-, it has been observed, has been deified (in the two <lb/> principal religions of the ancient western world), in Heaven, on Earth, <lb/> and in Hades, as Seirius, Anubis, and Kerberus. </note>

And <lb/> as for your tomb, and those costly marbles, they, perhaps, <lb/> may be of use to the good people of Halikarnassus, to show <lb/> off for their own benefit and to get honour for themselves <lb/> from strangers and visitors as having, no doubt, a certain <lb/> big building.

<p>Mausolus. Will all those things, then, be of no advantage <lb/> to me, and will Mausolus and Diogenes have an equality <lb/> of privilege ?</p> 
<p>Diogenes. Not an equality of privilege, most excellent <lb/> Sir,-certainly not.

But I <lb/> was always living and in the enjoyment of the same things <lb/> — sun, light, food ; and there were the same seasons, and <lb/> everything happened, each in its own order, following, as <lb/> it were, one after the other—I became, therefore, satiated <lb/> with them : for my pleasure was dependent not on its per­ <lb/> manence, but on the not being constantly participant in it.3

<p>Menippus. Take care, Cheiron, that you are not caught <lb/> in your own words, and your argument does not come <lb/> round to the same thing.</p> 
<p>Cheiron. How do you mean ?</p> 
<p>Menippus. That if everlasting sameness and similarity <lb/> of human life was the cause of your ennui, here, too, the <lb/> sameness of things must be equally matter for satiety for <lb/> you; and you will be obliged to seek some means of mi­ <lb/> grating from here, also, to another life, a thing which, I <lb/> imagine, is impossible.</p> 
<p>Cheiron. What should one do, then, Menippus ?</p> 
<p>Menippus. According to what is commonly said, I suppose <lb/> that a sensible man is pleased and content with his present <lb/> circumstances, and thinks none of them intolerable.</p>

 only two domestics, and that, though he had with him five <lb/> bowls of gold, and four cups. As for Arsakes—now ad­ <lb/> vanced in age and, indeed, not without some dignity about <lb/> his appearance, he was annoyed after the fashion of the <lb/> foreigner, and was highly indignant at trudging on foot, <lb/> and claimed it as his right that a horse should be supplied <lb/> to him; and, in fact, his horse had died with him, both <lb/> having been run through, at one stroke, by some Thracian <lb/> peltast, in the engagement on the Araxes with the <lb/> Kappadocian.1 For Arsakes charged, as he declared to <lb/> us, far in advance of the rest; while the Thracian, awaiting <lb/> the attack, covers himself with his round shield, and wards <lb/> off the spear-shaft of Arsakes, and, couching his own <lb/> Macedonian lance, runs him and his horse through at the <lb/> same time.</p> 
<p>Antisthenes. How was it possible for that to be done at <lb/> one stroke, Krates ?</p> 
<p>Krates. Very easily, Antisthenes. For he began charging, <lb/> pushing before him a spear-shaft of twenty cubits ; while <lb/> the Thracian, when with his shield he warded off from <lb/> himself the onslaught, and the spear-point passed him, <lb/> sank on his knees, and received the attack with his spear, <lb/> and wounds the horse under the chest, who ran himself <lb/> through by his own ardour and the vehemence of his speed. <lb/> And as for Arsakes, he is run right through from the groin <lb/> to the buttocks. You see something of what it was like r <lb/> the action was rather that of the horse than of the hero. <lb/> He was indignant, nevertheless, at being on a level with <lb/> the rest in point of dignity, and considered it as his right to <lb/> come down in the capacity of a knight. But as for Oroetes, <lb/> he was very tender-footed, and was not able even to stand <lb/> on the ground, not to say anything of walking-all Medes, <lb/> in point of fact, have this experience, on dismounting from <lb/> their horses : they walk as though upon thorns, on tiptoe, <lb/> and with difficulty get on at all-so that, when he threw

<p>Antisthenes.

<p>Diogenes. You, Krates, and you, Antisthenes, chanced to <lb/> tall in with fellow-travellers of such description. My <lb/> fellow-travellers down were Blepsias the money-lender, <lb/> from Pisa, and Lampis of Akarnania, who had been <lb/> captain of mercenaries, and Damis the millionaire, he <lb/> of Korinth. Damis died from poison administered by his <lb/> son ; Lampis cut his own throat for love of Myrtium, the <lb/> celebrated courtesan; while Blepsias, the poor wretch, was <lb/> said to have slowly starved to death ; and he showed it <lb/> clearly enough, appearing pallid to excess, and attenuated <lb/> to the most extreme point. I, although aware of the <lb/> facts, began to question them as to the manner of their <lb/> deaths. Then, when Damis was accusing his son, " You <lb/> suffered, however, no unjust fate at his hands," said I, <lb/> ‟ since, while you at once possessed a quarter of a million, <lb/> and lived in luxury yourself, nonagenarian as you were, <lb/> you used to supply a youth of eighteen with just sixpence. <lb/> And as for you, Air. Akarnanian (for he, too, was uttering <lb/> groans, and imprecating curses on Myrtium), why do you <lb/> blame Eros, when you ought to accuse yourself ? you who, <lb/> while you never trembled at the enemy in battle, but used <lb/> to fight, regardless of danger, in the front ranks, were <lb/> caught, admirable man, by the made-up tears and sighs of <lb/> a common prostitute !1As for Blepsias, he anticipated * <lb/> blame and accused himself, of his own accord, of exces­ <lb/> sive folly, in that he hoarded up his money for heirs in no <lb/> way related to him, thinking, the fool! to live for ever. <lb/> However, to me they afforded no common amusement by

However, I want <lb/> to question this superannuated old man.—What are you <lb/> weeping about, dying at your time of life ? Why are you <lb/> indignant, my fine Sir, and that, when you have arrived at <lb/> a good age ? You were, doubtless, some king?</p> 
<p>Poor Man. Not at all.</p> 
<p>Diogenes. Well, some satrap or other?</p> 
<p>Poor Man. Not that, even.</p> 
<p>Diogenes. Then you were, doubtless, a rich man, and it <lb/> troubles you, I suppose, to have died and left behind you <lb/> much luxury ?</p> 
<p>Poor Man. Nothing of that sort; on the contrary, I had <lb/> arrived at about the full age of ninety years, and led a life <lb/> of want, sustained by means of my fishing-rod and line, <lb/> excessively poor, childless, and lame, into the bargain, and <lb/> half blind.</p> 
<p>Diogenes. Then, though you were in such a condition, did <lb/> you wish to go on living ?</p> 
<p>Poor Man. Yes, for the light of day was sweet to me, <lb/> and to die is a terrible thing and to be avoided.</p> 
<p>Diogenes.

His transformation into one of the <lb/> opposite sex is attributed to his haying killed a female serpent, and <lb/> his double experience induced Zeus to make him arbiter in his dispute <lb/> with Hera upon the question, which sex has the greater enjoyment ; <lb/> and, when he pronounced in favour of the weaker, the indignant Hera. <lb/> deprived him of sight.

<p>Teiresias. Just see. You are ignorant of everything that <lb/> concerns me—how I put an end to a certain quarrel among <lb/> the gods, and how Hera blinded me, in consequence; and <lb/> how Zeus consoled me for my misfortune by the gift of <lb/> prophecy.2</p>

<p>Minos. Speak, let it only not be long, that we may pass <lb/> judgment on the rest of them forthwith.</p> 
<p>Sostratus. Whatsoever actions I performed in my life, <lb/> whether did I do them, of my own free will, or had they <lb/> been spun out for me by the Fate ? 1</p> 
<p>Minos. By the Fate, to be sure.</p> 
<p>Sostratus. Well, then, did all of us who have the repu­ <lb/> tation of being good or bad, do those actions of ours as <lb/> subservient to her ?</p> 
<p>Minos. Certainly to Klotho, who appoints to each one at <lb/> birth what he is to do.</p> 
<p>Sostratus. If, then, a man, forced by another, should <lb/> murder some one, having no power of resisting his com­ <lb/> pulsion, such as a public executioner or an officer of the <lb/> guard-the one obeying the judge, the other the prince­ <lb/> whom would you charge with the murder ?</p> 
<p>Minos. It is clear one would have to charge the judge or <lb/> prince; since it is not the sword itself we must accuse,2 for <lb/> that, as the instrument for his rage, is merely the minister <lb/> of him who first gave the occasion for its use.</p> 
<p>Sostratus. Bravo, Minos, for giving more forcible illus­ <lb/> tration to my instance.-And if a man, when his master <lb/> sends him, comes in place of his master, with gold or silver, <lb/> to whom must one attribute the favour, or whom must one <lb/> register as the benefactor ?</p> 
<p>Minos. The sender ; for the carrier is an agent merely.</p> 
<p>Sostratus. Do you see, then, how unjustly you act in 
<note type="footnote"> 1 Namely Klotho, the <foreign xml:lang="grc">Μοίρα</foreign> whose particular province it was to <lb/>
unwind or spin out the thread of human existence, whence her name. <lb/> See ’<foreign xml:lang="grc">Ελεγχομ</foreign>.

<title type="main">ZEUS THE TRAGEDIAN.</title>

</head>

<note><p>[ZEUS, gloomy and in tragic distress, is implored by <lb/>
Hermes and Athena to divulge the cause of his melan­ <lb/> choly condition; while Hera, true to her Homeric character, <lb/> confidently attributes it to another earthly amour. The <lb/> king of gods and men, thus adjured, announces the true <lb/> reason of his anxiety-flaring assaults upon the character <lb/> of himself and the rest of the Olympian divinities, and, in <lb/> fact, denial of their very existence, by the skeptics, repre­ <lb/> sented by an Epikurean philosopher named Damis ; and the <lb/> weakness of the arguments of their over-zealous apologists, <lb/> the Stoics, represented by a champion named Timokles: <lb/> which all-important controversy he had chanced to over­ <lb/> hear when present, on the day preceding, at a sacrificial <lb/> feast given to the Gods at Athens.</p> 
<p>He proceeds to request the opinions of the three divini­ <lb/> ties upon the best course to be pursued, in the emergency. <lb/> Hera and Hermes propose a Council of the Gods; Athena, <lb/> a private settlement of the business. The former opinion <lb/> prevails, and Zeus directs Hermes to summon the rest of <lb/> the Gods to a general Council, which the Olympian herald <lb/> proceeds to do in the orthodox Homeric style, after some <lb/> reluctance on account of his want of poetic skill, and in <lb/> face of the discouraging example of Apollo, whose pro­ <lb/> phetic utterances (in verse) had become the object of so <lb/> much ridicule. Some difficulty arises, at the outset, on <lb/> the question of precedence, both because (the representative <lb/> statues of the divinities being variously formed of gold, <lb/> silver, ivory, and bronze) it was a question whether it <lb/> should be decided by the material, or by the excellence of <lb/> 
<pb n="169"/>
 the workmanship; and, also, by reason of the numerous <lb/> recent additions to their august body. Zeus rules that <lb/> gold must have the preference. By this decision the old­ <lb/> established, genuine Hellenic divinities find themselves <lb/> forced to give way to the novi homines, not without much <lb/> and protracted squabbling. In the end, by the ruling of <lb/> the president, the members of the celestial Senate have to <lb/> take their places promiscuously, on the principle of " first <lb/> come first served."</p> 
<p>Silence having been secured, Zeus rises to open the <lb/> deliberations. An unaccustomed nervousness and hesita­ <lb/> tion threaten to spoil his exordium, and even to ruin every­ <lb/> thing, by raising suspicion of the soundness of their cause. <lb/> At length, at the suggestion of Hermes, discarding the <lb/> well-worn Homeric exordium, he opens in the words of a <lb/> famous oration of Demosthenes. He sets forth the cause <lb/> of the summoning of the Council, and reports the circum­ <lb/> stances which led to his presence at the dispute between <lb/> the Epikurean and Stoic champions, in the Painted Porch <lb/> at Athens, and its fortunate interruption at a critical <lb/> moment by the pressure of the crowd, with its consequent <lb/> adjournment. The Gods, whom age and standing permit, <lb/> are then invited to deliver their several opinions upon the <lb/> course of action to be adopted. Momus, the Censor of the <lb/> Olympian Court, rises, and, with his usual candour, affirms <lb/> that the objections and arguments of their avowed enemies <lb/> are not at all to be wondered at; and, in fact, himself <lb/> points to the prevalence of injustice and cruelty, the <lb/> triumph of the bad, and the oppression and sufferings of <lb/> the good on the Earth. He takes occasion to ridicule the <lb/> studied ambiguity and obscurity of Apollo and his oracular <lb/> prophecies, and the mischiefs arising from them ; and next <lb/> criticises the policy which admitted so many strange and <lb/> outlandish divinities to the rights of Olympian Godship.</p> 
<p>Poseidon and Apollo next address the Council; the <lb/> former voting for violent and summary measures-nothing <lb/> less, in fact, than the destruction of Damis by a thunderbolt; <lb/> in which opinion (later) he is vigorously supported by <lb/> Herakles. The latter calls attention to the inferiority, and <lb/> confused and illogical method, of their apologist, and advises <lb/> that an associate-advocate be supplied to him, to whom alone <lb/> 
<pb n="170"/>
 it should be allowed to speak, Timokles acting merely as his <lb/> prompter. The opportunity is not lost by Momus for sar­ <lb/> castic allusion to Apollo's own confused prophetical style; <lb/> and, ridiculing the proposition of an associate-advocate, he <lb/> calls upon him opportunely to give some ex tempore speci­ <lb/> mens of his oracular faculty. Thus urged, with much <lb/> reluctance and diffidence Apollo complies, to the great <lb/> entertainment of his censor. At this juncture there arrives <lb/> in hot haste, fresh from the yesterday's scene of verbal <lb/> conflict at the Painted Porch, Hermagoras, a statuary, who, <lb/> like the Ephesian town-clerk, may be supposed to have <lb/> been a not entirely disinterested well-wisher to the Olym­ <lb/> pian Establishment. In iambic verse he announces the <lb/> approaching renewal of hostilities, in the oracular strain so <lb/> dear to Apollo, and so well known to readers of Herodotus, <lb/> of the ’<foreign xml:lang="grc">Ορνίθες</foreign> and ’<foreign xml:lang="grc">Ιππε</foreign>ĩ<foreign xml:lang="grc">ς</foreign> of Aristophanes, and of Lucian.</p> 
<p>The Celestials arrange themselves in attitudes of eager ex­ <lb/> pectancy ; and the verbal duel below begins with a vitupera­ <lb/> tive onslaught (in which controversial virtue Zeus recognizes <lb/> their champion's strength to lie) on the part of Timokles, and <lb/> a dispute on the question upon which of the two rested the <lb/> onus probandi. This being settled, at length, by the con­ <lb/> cession of Damis in favour of his opponent, the combatants <lb/> engage in earnest. As the fortune of the day seems to <lb/> incline to this side or that, the celestial -spectators express, <lb/> chorus-like, their hopes or fears-the latter, however, very <lb/> greatly preponderating; Momus not omitting to exercise <lb/> his powers of sarcasm. Timokles, after vainly throwing <lb/> overboard his sheet-anchor-in the shape of a remarkable <lb/> syllogism-takes refuge, as his opponent tauntingly ex­ <lb/> presses it, at the altars. Damis, claiming the victory, now <lb/> retires from the scene, pursued by the vituperation and <lb/> even missiles and blows of his enraged antagonist. The <lb/> celestial clients of Timokles disperse, consoled by the re­ <lb/> flection of Hermes, that, in spite of all the arguments of <lb/> the wicked philosophers, at all events the larger part of <lb/> the world, Greek as well as barbarian, will continue to be <lb/> on their side, and not cease to supply them with the rich <lb/> steams of sacrifice. Zeus, however, cannot refrain from <lb/> the expression of his feeling, that he would rather have <lb/> 
<pb n="171"/>
 one such able champion as the Epikurean, than a thousand <lb/> conquests by stratagem or force.</p> 
<p>This masterpiece of Lucian opens with parodies (in <lb/> hexameter and iambic verse) of the Homeric epics, of <lb/> Euripides, and the tragic poets.]</p></note>

<p>Hera. I know the real source of your sufferings—a love-affair.

<p>Hera. But what else, if not this, annoys you-con­ <lb/> sidering you are Zeus himself ?</p> 
<p>Zeus. In peril dire, affairs divine are placed, and here is <lb/> the proverb verified, Hera, " it now stands upon a razor's <lb/> edge," <ref n="1"/> whether we are to have honour any longer paid to <lb/> us, and to have our accustomed honours on Earth, or, in <lb/> fact, to be altogether neglected, and to have no reputation <lb/> at all.</p> 
<p>Hera. The Earth has not produced any Giants again, <lb/> has it ? Or have the Titans burst their chains, and over­ <lb/> powered their guard, and do they once again take up arms <lb/> against us ?</p> 
<p>Zeus. Fear not: no danger threatens from below.2</p> 
<p>Hera. What else, pray, could there be to alarm ? For I <lb/> don't see, if something of the sort does not distress you, <lb/> for what reason you leave your proper character, and come <lb/> out as another Polus or Aristodemus.3</p>

At this juncture, a dense <lb/> mob surging against them, there was no definite conclu­ <lb/> sion of the conference ; for they separated, after agreeing <lb/> to consider the remaining arguments at some future time. <lb/> And now all are in a state of suspense in regard to this <lb/> discussion, as to which shall have the best of it, and be

You see <lb/> the danger, how our interests are altogether in a strait, <lb/> risked upon the ability of one man.1 And one of two <lb/> things must happen-either we must be despised, and be <lb/> voted mere names, or we are to be honoured as heretofore, <lb/> supposing Timokles shall have the best of the argument.</p> 
<p>Hera. A terrible state of things, this, of a verity; and <lb/> not without reason, Zeus, were you acting the tragedian, <lb/> under the circumstances.</p> 
<p>Zeus. And you imagined that, in such trouble, I had <lb/> thought of a Danae or Antiope !- What now, Hermes, and <lb/> Hera, and Aphrodite, should we do ? Do you together, <lb/> according to your several ability, devise something.</p> 
<p>Hermes. For my part, I hold you should summon an <lb/> Assembly, and refer the consideration of the matter to the <lb/> whole body of the Gods.</p> 
<p>Hera. I am exactly of the same way of thinking.</p> 
<p>Athena. I, however, have the contrary opinion, father­ <lb/> that we don't throw heaven into utter confusion, nor make <lb/> it plain that you are disturbed by the occurrence, but <lb/> manage this business privately, in such manner that <lb/> Timokles shall have the best of it in argument, and <lb/> Damis leave the conference an object of thorough ridicule.</p> 
<p>Hermes. But since the contest of the philosophers will <lb/> be in public, these things will not be unknown, Zeus, and <lb/> you will have the repute of being tyrannical, should you <lb/> not throw open to all a discussion about matters of so much <lb/> importance and general interest.</p> 
<p>Zeus. Well, then, make your proclamation at once, and <lb/> let all of them put in an appearance-for you are right.</p> 
<p>Hermes. (mounting the bema.) Halloo! I say, come <lb/> together, you Gods, to a meeting; don't loiter, come all, in <lb/> a body, come ! we shall discuss business of great importance.</p> 
<p>Zeus. Is it in this bare, unornamental, and prosaic style <lb/> you make your proclamation, Hermes; and that, too, when <lb/> you are summoning them on matters of highest import ?</p> 
<p>Hermes. Well, but how, Zeus, do you require me to do it ? 
<note type="footnote"> 1 Zeus may have condescended to borrow this expression from the <lb/>
famous Funeral Oration of Perikles, as reported by Thucydides :-<foreign xml:lang="grc">μὴ <lb/> ἐν ἑν</foreign>ì <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀνδρὶ πολλω̃ν ὰρετὰς κινδυνεύεσθσι ευ̉ τε κα</foreign>ì <foreign xml:lang="grc">χει̃ρον εἰπόντι πιστευ <lb/> θη̃ναι</foreign>. ii. 35. </note></p>

<p>Zeus. How do I require you to do it ? I say you ought <lb/> to impart solemnity to your proclamation by some sort of <lb/> verse, and with poetical magniloquence, that they may be <lb/> induced to assemble with more alacrity.</p> 
<p>Hermes. Yes, but such is the business of versemakers and <lb/> professional reciters, while I am not the least of a poet. So <lb/> I shall completely spoil my proclamation, by stringing <lb/> together verses either with too many or too few feet, and <lb/> shall be the object of their ridicule for my want of poetic <lb/> skill. In fact, I observe that even Apollo himself is laughed <lb/> at for some of his oracular responses,1 although his obscu­ <lb/> rity 2 conceals the greater part of his blunders, as his <lb/> hearers have not too much leisure for examining his <lb/> metrical effusions.</p> 
<p>Zeus. Then, Hermes, mix up in your proclamation, <lb/> chiefly, verses from Homer, in the manner he was wont to <lb/> convene us. Of course, you call them to mind ?</p> 
<p>Hermes. Not so very accurately and readily ; but, all the <lb/> same, I will try (much preliminary clearing of the throat):— <lb/> Let none of Gods, whate’er the sex, fail to obey my summons, <lb/> Nor any River stay behind, except the stream of Ocean, <lb/> Nor any Nymph: but haste ye all to swell the lofty Council <lb/> Of Zeus, whoe'er at hecatombs illustrious are feasted, <lb/> Modest howe'er your rank-if mean, or even stark ignoble, <lb/> Come hither, all, whoever sit beside the steaming altars.3

<p>Zeus. Bravo, Hermes. You have performed your crier's <lb/> part most admirably; and, indeed, they are already rushing <lb/> together. So take and seat them, each according to rank, <lb/> as it belongs to him by reason of material or art-the <lb/> Golden in the front rank, then next to them the Silver; <lb/> next in due order all the Ivory ones; after them the <lb/> Bronze or the Marble; and among these same let those <lb/> of Pheidias, or Alkamenes, or Myron, or Euphranor,1 or <lb/> of similar artists, have the best places.

But it's not so easy to know-when any one of <lb/> them is of gold, indeed, and of many hundredweight,2 <lb/> but not perfect in workmanship, but plainly vulgar and <lb/> plebeian, and badly proportioned, shall he seat himself <lb/> before the bronze gentlemen of Myron, and of Polykleitus,3 <lb/> and of Pheidias, and the marble ones of Alkamenes ?

Hellas and the world is sufficiently well known. Alkamenes, the most <lb/> eminent of the pupils of Pheidias, was especially famous for a statue of <lb/> Aphrodite. Myron, the sculptor of the well-known Discobolos, an elder <lb/> contemporary of Pheidias, was the Landseer of Greek sculptors. His Cow <lb/> was especially in high repute, and in the Greek Anthologia thirty-six <lb/> epigrams celebrate her praise. It was removed from Athens between the <lb/> age of Cicero and that of Pausanias. This beautiful statue survived, at <lb/> least, tothe sixth century. Of the works of Euphranor, a native of Korinth, <lb/> but, like most of the great artists, resident at the " hospitable " Athens, <lb/> most celebrated was his representation of Paris, of which the statue in <lb/> the Museo Pio-Clementino is probably a copy.

 at the Peiræus, such of us as Mnesitheus invited to the <lb/> sacrifice. Then, after the libations, you turned your­ <lb/> selves to your several occupations, each according to <lb/> his fancy; but I, for it was not yet very late, went up to <lb/> the city, to have an evening walk in the Kerameikus,1 <lb/> reflecting, at the same time, on the niggardliness of Mnesi­ <lb/> theus, who, to entertain sixteen Gods, slaughtered only a <lb/> single cock, and that, too, a long since old and wheezy one, <lb/> and four grains of exceedingly mouldy incense,2 so that it <lb/> was at once consumed on the coals, and did not afford as <lb/> much smoke as could be smelled by even the tip of our <lb/> nostrils ; and that, though he promised whole hecatombs, <lb/> when his ship was just being carried on to the rocks, and <lb/> was actually within the breakers. And, when pondering <lb/> these things, I find myself near the Stoa,3 I observe a very <lb/> large crowd of people jammed together-some within, in <lb/> the Hall itself, but many in the open air; and some <lb/> persons shouting and vehemently clamouring, seated on <lb/> the benches. Guessing then, what indeed was the fact, <lb/> that these were philosophers of those contentious sort, I <lb/> had a mind to stand by and listen to what they say; and <lb/> (for I had enwrapped myself, as it chanced, in a cloud of <lb/> the densest), by disguising myself in their fashion, and by <lb/> letting down my beard, I had a pretty close resemblance <lb/> to a philosopher. Well, I say, elbowing aside the crowd, <lb/> I enter without being known who I was. There I find <lb/> the Epicurean Damis, the practised villain, and Timokles, <lb/> the Stoic, best of men, disputing with uncommon vehe­ <lb/> mence. Timokles, in fact, was actually all in a perspiration, <lb/> and already becoming hoarse, by his loud shouting ; while

 Damis, making fun of him sardonically, still further <lb/> provoked his antagonist. Their whole argument, for­ <lb/> sooth, was about us. Why, that accursed Damis was <lb/> affirming that neither do we exercise any providence over <lb/> men, nor superintend their actions; maintaining nothing <lb/> else than our entire non-existence, for that plainly was what <lb/> his argument amounted to. There were some who applauded <lb/> him. But the other, Timokles, took our' part, and <lb/> fought for us vehemently,1 and fell into a passion, and <lb/> struggled for us in every possible way, glorifying our pro­ <lb/> vidence, and recounting with what beautiful order and <lb/> suitable arrangement we plan and dispose each particular <lb/> part. He, also, had some backers, but, indeed, he had <lb/> already tired himself out, and was speaking badly, and the <lb/> majority were beginning to fix their attention entirely on <lb/> Damis. I, perceiving all that was imperilled, ordered Night <lb/> to envelop them and break up the meeting. Thereupon they <lb/> went off, after agreeing to discuss the subject fully on the <lb/> next day; and I, joining the crowds, listened to their praises <lb/> of Damis's arguments, while they were on their way to their <lb/> homes, and already choosing his side in far the larger <lb/> numbers : there were some, however, who thought it fair not <lb/> to condemn beforehand the opposite arguments, but to wait <lb/> to see if Timokles shall say anything to the point to-morrow.</p> 
<p>These are the reasons for which I called you together; no <lb/> trifling ones, O Gods, if you shall consider how our whole <lb/> honour, and glory, and revenue consist in men.

<p>And here, Zeus—for we are all by ourselves, and no <lb/> human creature is present in this Assembly, except <lb/> Herakles, and Dionysus, and Ganymedes, and Asklepius,1 <lb/> those illegally enregistered Gods there-answer me truly, <lb/> if you have ever had so much care for human affairs as <lb/> to trouble your head as to who of them are bad, or who <lb/> are good. But you cannot say you have. If, in fact, <lb/> Theseus on his way from Troezene to Athens, as a sort of <lb/> diversion on the journey, had not exterminated those rascals, <lb/> as far as depended on you and your providence nothing <lb/> would have prevented Skeiron, and Pityokamptes, and <lb/> Kerkyon,2 and the rest from being now alive and revelling <lb/> in the murders of travellers. Or, unless Eurystheus, a <lb/> man of old-fashioned morality and of some forethought, <lb/> out of pure philanthropy had investigated the condition of <lb/> every people, and despatched his domestic here [pointing to <lb/> Herakles], an active fellow, and eager for adventures and <lb/> toils, little you would have cared, Zeus, about the Hydra, <lb/> and the Stymphalian birds, and the Thracian horses, and <lb/> the wanton and drunken insolence of the Kentaurs. Nay, if <lb/> the truth must be told, we sit here looking out only for <lb/> this-whether there is anyone sacrificing and raising the <lb/> fat steam of burnt offerings at the altars, while everything <lb/> else is borne down the stream of fate, swept along as the <lb/> chance of each directs. Accordingly, we now suffer what <lb/> might have been expected, and we shall suffer still, when <lb/> men, little by little rising up from their prostrate condition, <lb/> shall find that they get no profit by their sacrifices to us <lb/> and religious processions. So, I suppose, in a short time, <lb/> you will see the Epikuruses, and Metrodoruses,3 and

 such importance, that leave to speak is not regulated by <lb/> age, but is thrown open to all : for a .pretty thing it would <lb/> be if, while we were in extremest peril, we should split <lb/> straws about legal qualification. And, besides, you have <lb/> this long while been quite legally capable of speaking ; for <lb/> you have long ago emerged from the state of minorship, <lb/> and have been inscribed on the register of the Twelve,1 and <lb/> are not so far from having been a member of the Council <lb/> in the time of Kronos himself. So don't affect youthful <lb/> modesty with us, but speak boldly now your opinions, with­ <lb/> out bashfulness for having to harangue the House without. <lb/> a beard ; and that, especially, when you have a son, Askle­ <lb/> pius, with so thick and fine-grown a one. Besides, it <lb/> were surely fitting for you most particularly to show off <lb/> your wisdom on the present occasion, unless you sit on <lb/> Helikon, philosophizing with the Muses, to no purpose.</p> 
<p>Apollo. But it's not for you, Momus, to give such per­ <lb/> mission, but for Zeus; and should he bid me, I might, <lb/> perhaps, say something not altogether unworthy of the <lb/> Muses, but befitting our meditative studies on Helikon.</p> 
<p>Zeus. Speak, my child, for I give full permission.</p> 
<p>Apollo. This Timokles is, indeed, a good and pious man, <lb/> and he has thoroughly acquired the methods of argument <lb/> of the Stoics ; so that he associates, in fact, with many of <lb/> the youth for the purpose of teaching them philosophy, and <lb/> he pockets no small pay upon this account; for he is <lb/> exceedingly persuasive whenever he disputes in private <lb/> with his pupils; but in a crowd he is very timid in <lb/> speaking, and is vulgar and provincial2 in language, so as­ <lb/> to incur ridicule in his controversies on that account, from <lb/> not connecting his sentences, but stammering and getting <lb/> confused; particularly when, though such is his peculiarity, <lb/> he wishes to show off his graces of oratory. For, in mere <lb/> intelligence, indeed, he is acute and subtle to an excess, as. <lb/> say those who best know the learning of the Stoics : but, <lb/> in speaking and expounding, he spoils and confuses it by <lb/> this weakness, as he does not explain his meaning clearly,

 but offers arguments very like riddles, and, besides, replies <lb/> much too ambiguously to the questions put to him, and <lb/> people who don't understand him laugh outright at him. <lb/> One ought, however, I imagine, to speak with clearness, and <lb/> to pay great attention to this point especially-that one's <lb/> hearers shall understand one.</p> 
<p>Momus. You are perfectly right in this, Apollo, in com­ <lb/> mending those who speak clearly, even though you do not <lb/> yourself altogether practise it in your oracles ; for you are <lb/> ambiguous and enigmatical, and safely marshal them, for <lb/> the most part, in a neutral position between both camps,1 so <lb/> that the hearers want another Pythian Apollo to interpret <lb/> them. But what do you advise next ? what remedy to <lb/> apply to the feebleness of Timokles in argument?</p> 
<p>Apollo. To supply, Momus, if by any means we can, another <lb/> as his mouth-piece,2 one of those clever fellows, to speak <lb/> suitably what the other may think out and suggest.</p> 
<p>Momus. The remark, that, of a beardless youth with a ven­ <lb/> geance, and who still needs his tutor-that his mouth-piece <lb/> should take his stand by his side, in a conference of philo­ <lb/> sophers, to act as interpreter of the sentiments of Timokles <lb/> to the audience; and that Damis should speak in his own <lb/> person, and by his own mouth, while the other have the <lb/> aid of a public interpreter to privately whisper in his ear, <lb/> and prompt him to speak his own sentiments ! And an in­ <lb/> terpreter is to act the orator, who probably even does not <lb/> understand himself what he hears ! How can these things <lb/> not be a source of ridicule for the multitude ? Nay, let <lb/> us consider this matter in a different fashion. And you, <lb/> excellent Sir—for you profess, in fact, to be a prophet, and <lb/> have procured no small quantity of profit for such work, so <lb/> far even as before now to have received gold bricks3—why <lb/> did not you seasonably exhibit to us your art, by predicting <lb/> which of the philosophers will come off conqueror in the

<p>Momus (laughing). There! though you are caught in a <lb/> corner, you are for escaping conviction.1</p> 
<p>Zeus. All the same, my child, speak, and don't afford this <lb/> calumniator here a handle for calumniating and mocking <lb/> at your art, as though it depended upon a tripod, and <lb/> water, and incense; as though, if you have not these <lb/> appliances, you would be deprived of the power of exercising <lb/> your art.</p> 
<p>Apollo. It -were better, father, to perform such functions <lb/> at Delphi or Kolophon,2 with all my useful tools at hand, as is <lb/> my wont. All the same, even though thus destitute of those <lb/> things, and unequipped, I will do my endeavour to prophesy <lb/> to which of the two the victory will belong.

But this <lb/> Timokles does not altogether please me—he is all of a <lb/> tremble and confused; that man will ruin everything to-day.

<p>Timokles. What do you say, you robber of temples­ <lb/> that the Gods don't exist, nor exercise any providential <lb/> care over men ?</p> 
<p>Damis. No, but you, first of all, answer me, by what <lb/> reasoning were you persuaded that they do exist ?</p> 
<p>Timokles. Certainly I shall not: rather do you, abomina­ <lb/> ble villain, reply to me.</p> 
<p>Damis. No, indeed; you, rather, make answer to me.</p> 
<p>Zeus (looking up from his trap-door). Our friend so far <lb/> exhibits his wrath in much better and more euphonious <lb/> fashion. Bravo, Timokles! pour out upon him all the <lb/> vials of your vituperative powers, for in that lies your <lb/> sistrength; since, in other respects, he will shut you up, and <lb/> make you as dumb as a fish.</p> 
<p>Timokles. No, by Athena! no, I will not answer you first.</p> 
<p>Damis. Then, pray, put your questions, Timokles, for <lb/> you have conquered me by that oath: but without bad <lb/> language, if you please.3</p> 
<p>Timokles. You say well. Tell me then, accursed villain, <lb/> do you not believe the Gods exercise providence ?</p> 
<p>Damis. By no means.</p> 
<p>Timokles. What do you say ? Do all these things, pray, <lb/> go on without providential interference ?

<p>Timokles. And is the care of the Universe not placed <lb/> under the superintendence of any God at all, then ?</p> 
<p>Damis. No.</p> 
<p>Timokles. And are all things borne along at random, by <lb/> irrational impulse ?</p> 
<p>Damis. Yes.</p> 
<p>Timokles (to the audience). And so you good people en­ <lb/> dure to hear this, and you will not stone the impious <lb/> sinner ?</p> 
<p>Damis. Why do you incite the people against me, Timo­ <lb/> kles; or, who are you, to be angry on behalf of the Gods, <lb/> and that when they themselves are not angry ? At all events, <lb/> they have taken no very severe measure against me, though <lb/> they have heard me this long time, supposing they do hear.</p> 
<p>Timokles. Yes, Damis, they hear, they do hear, and will <lb/> punish you sooner or later, hereafter.</p> 
<p>Damis. And when could they have leisure to look after <lb/> me, seeing they have, as you say, so much business on <lb/> their hands, in administering the affairs of the universe, in­ <lb/> finite in number ? So that they have not even yet punished <lb/> you for the perjuries you are constantly committing, and <lb/> the rest of your crimes, on which I am silent, that I may <lb/> not be myself compelled to use vituperative language, <lb/> contrary to our agreement. Yet I do not see what other <lb/> greater proof of their providence they could produce than <lb/> by making a miserable end of a miserable man like you. <lb/> But they are, evidently, away from home, beyond the <lb/> Ocean, perhaps, "with the blameless Æthiopians.”1 At <lb/> least, it was their custom constantly to go to them to <lb/> dinner; sometimes, too, at their own invitation.</p> 
<p>Timokles. What can I say to such shameless ribaldry ?</p> 
<p>Damis. That particular thing which I have for some time <lb/> been longing to hear from you, Timokles—how you were <lb/> persuaded to think that the Gods exercise providential <lb/> care.</p>

 in the first place, persuaded me—the Sun always holding <lb/> the same course, and the Moon in the same way; and <lb/> the revolving Seasons, and the growing vegetation, and <lb/> the birth of animated beings, and these same animals fur­ <lb/> nished with so beautiful a mechanism, so as to feed them­ <lb/> selves, and to be capable of reflection, and of movement, <lb/> and of walking, and of doing carpentry, and making shoes, <lb/> and the rest-do not these things appear to you to be the <lb/> actions of rational provision ?</p> 
<p>Damis. You are, I take it, begging the very thing in ques­ <lb/> tion,1 for it is not yet proved whether each of these things <lb/> is effected by rational provision. But that the order of <lb/> Nature is such as you say I could readily affirm myself. It <lb/> is not, however, a necessary conclusion, to be persuaded <lb/> forthwith that it comes about by any intelligent contri­ <lb/> vance : for it is possible that, having begun fortuitously, <lb/> the universe is now kept together similarly and after <lb/> a like fashion. But you call their orderly arrangement <lb/> necessity. Next, you will get into a rage, I suppose, should <lb/> one not follow you in your enumeration and eulogy of all <lb/> things that happen, of whatever sort; and in your belief <lb/> that they are a proof of the intelligent ordering of each <lb/> one of them by providential design: so that, according to <lb/> the comic poet :­ <lb/> " Too wretched this : another plea produce." 2</p> 
<p>Timokles. I don't believe there is need of any further <lb/> demonstration upon this matter. All the same, however, I <lb/> will ask, and answer me then, do you think Homer to be <lb/> a most excellent poet ?</p> 
<p>Damis. Of course.</p> 
<p>Timokles. I believed him, then, when he declares the pro­ <lb/> vidence of the Gods.</p> 
<p>JamiM. Well, admirable Sir, all persons will concede to <lb/> you that Homer was a good poet, but not that, of such matters, <lb/> either he or any other poet is a trustworthy witness. For <lb/> they care not for truth, I imagine, but for enchanting their <lb/> hearers, and, therefore, they charm them by their verses and

 instruct them by their fables; and, in fine, use every device <lb/> with a view to delighting. However, I should be truly glad <lb/> to hear by which of Homer's verses you were especially per­ <lb/> suaded. Was it, perhaps, those in which he speaks of <lb/> Zeus, how his daughter, and brother, and wife formed a <lb/> conspiracy to put him in fetters; and, unless Thetis, as <lb/> cognisant of the occurrence,1 had summoned Briareus, our <lb/> most excellent Zeus would have been carried off and actu­ <lb/> ally put into prison ?2 In return for which good offices, <lb/> calling to mind his debt of gratitude to Thetis, he <lb/> deceives Agamemnon by sending him a certain lying <lb/> dream, so that many of the Achæans perished.3 Do you <lb/> observe ? It was impossible for him to hurl his thunder­ <lb/> bolt and burn up Agamemnon there, on the spot, without <lb/> acquiring the reputation of an impostor. Or, is it hearing <lb/> these particulars that have chiefly forced you into belief­ <lb/> how Diomedes wounded Aphrodite, and afterwards Ares <lb/> himself, at the instigation of Athena; and how, a little <lb/> after, the Gods themselves engaged in battle, and fought <lb/> duels, ladies and gentlemen indiscriminately: and how <lb/> Athena conquers Ares, as he had been, I suppose, before­ <lb/> hand disabled by the wound which he had received from <lb/> Diomedes,4 <lb/> “Luck-bringer Hermes stout defied the deity of Leto," 5

 or do those stories about Artemis appear to you particularly <lb/> worthy of credit-when she complains and is indignant <lb/> because she was not invited by CEneus to a feast, and <lb/> accordingly sends a certain wild boar, of huge size and <lb/> irresistible strength, against his country.1 Is it, indeed, <lb/> by such narratives that Homer has persuaded you, pray ?</p> 
<p>Zeus (in alarm, to the Gods). Bless me! how the mob shout <lb/> applause of Damis! while our man seems like one in <lb/> despair. He is certainly afraid, and is all of a tremble, and <lb/> evidently is on the point of throwing away his shield,2 and <lb/> already is casting about how he shall steal away and escape.</p> 
<p>Timokles. Does not even Euripides, pray, seem to you to <lb/> speak with any reason, whenever he mounts the Gods them­ <lb/> selves upon the stage ; and represents them as protecting <lb/> the good heroes, and crushing the wicked, and wickedness <lb/> such as yours ?</p> 
<p>Damis. But, most admirable of philosophers, if the tragic <lb/> poets by so doing have persuaded you, one of two things <lb/> must follow: either, that you regard Polus and Aristodemus, <lb/> and Satyrus,3 on those occasions, as divine; or, the very <lb/> masks of the Gods, and the tragic boots, and the long­ <lb/> flowing dresses, and the short mantle, and the flowing <lb/> sleeves, and the false paunches, and paddings, and the other <lb/> things by which they give the grand air to tragedy: a <lb/> supposition which I presume to be highly ridiculous. For, <lb/> whenever Euripides, in his own person, is speaking his own <lb/> opinions, when the requirement of the dramatic action <lb/> does not constrain him, hear him declaring boldly:­ <lb/> " See'st thou this vast expanse of air above, <lb/> In whose moist arms our Earth is firmly poised ? <lb/> That, that for Zeus; that only God accept." <lb/> And again :— <lb/> “Whoe'er Zeus be: for nought of him I know <lb/> But by report," 4 <lb/> and the like.

<p>Timokles. Have all mankind, then, and all nations been <lb/> deceived in believing in gods, and solemnly celebrating <lb/> them?</p> 
<p>Damis. Capital, Timokles, for you bring to my mind the <lb/> received belief among different nations, from which one <lb/> may most certainly be assured that their language about <lb/> Deity has nothing sure or certain about it. For many <lb/> are their confused contradictions, and some believe and <lb/> practise one thing, and some another. The Scythians <lb/> offer sacrifices to a Dagger,1 the Thracians to Zamolxis,2 <lb/> a runaway slave who came to them from Samos; the <lb/> Phrygians to Meen,3 the Æthiopians to the Day, the <lb/> Cyllenians to Phales,4 the Assyrians to a Dove,5 the Per­ <lb/> sians to Fire, the Egyptians to Water. Although this water <lb/> is a divinity common to all the Egyptians, yet, locally, the <lb/> ox is the divinity of the people of Memphis, the onion of <lb/> the people of Pelusium, the ibis of others, or the crocodile, <lb/> the dog-faced baboon, the cat, or the ape.6 Nay, more, in <lb/> the country districts, to some his godship is the right <lb/> shoulder, while to those living on the opposite side of the

<p>Zeus. You did say so, Momus, and you rightly chided <lb/> -as ; and I, for my part, will do my best to set these matters <lb/> straight, if we get clear off from this danger before us.</p> 
<p>Timokles. But, you enemy of the Gods, the Oracles, and <lb/> Prophecies of future events-whose work would you affirm <lb/> them to be, rather than that of the Gods and of their pro­ <lb/> vidence ?</p> 
<p>Damis. Don't say a word, excellent Sir, about the <lb/> Oracles ; since I shall ask you which of them, in particular, <lb/> you would like to mention. Is it the one which the <lb/> Pythian returned to the Lydian, which was beautifully <lb/> two-edged and double-faced, such as are some of our <lb/> Hermæ,1 double and alike on both sides; to whichever <lb/> part of them you turn. For what did it mean ? That <lb/> Krcesus, by crossing the river Halys, will destroy his own <lb/> kingdom, or rather that of Cyrus ? Yet that pest of Sardis <lb/> purchased this ambiguous verse at the cost of not a few <lb/> thousands.</p> 
<p>Momus. The man is discussing and handling pretty nearly <lb/> the very things, Gods, which I especially had dreaded.— <lb/> Where, now, is that handsome lute-player of ours ? (To <lb/> Apollo) Go down at once, and make your defence in reply <lb/> to these charges.</p> 
<p>Zeus. You kill me entirely, Momus, by your un­ <lb/> seasonable sarcasms. <lb/> " Inde furor vulgo, quod numine vicinorum <lb/> Odit uterque locus, quùm solos credit habendos <lb/> Esse deos, quos ipse colit."

And how could I fail to hear thunder, Timokles ? <lb/> But whether it is Zeus who thunders,4 you might know <lb/> better than I, as you have come, perchance, from that quarter, <lb/> direct from the Gods. Yet some, who come from Krete, <lb/> tell us a different tale-that a certain tomb is shown there; <lb/> and that a column stands close by informing us that Zeus <lb/> would never thunder again, as he had been dead ages ago.5

So, too,. <lb/> among the passengers, you will see some worthless fellow <lb/> seated by the side of the captain, in the most commanding <lb/> place, and being made much of; and another, some un­ <lb/> natural wretch, or parricide, or swindler, honoured above­ <lb/> all the rest, and occupying the highest posts in the vessel; <lb/> many persons of good taste or feeling crowded into a corner <lb/> of the ship, and trampled upon by those really inferior to. <lb/> themselves. Consider, in fact, in what manner Sokrates and <lb/> Aristeides made their voyage, and Phokion, who had not even <lb/> sufficient bread to eat,4 nor even were able to stretch their legs <lb/> upon the bare planks along the hold ; while in the midst of <lb/> how many good things lived a Kallias, a Meidias,5 and a <lb/> Sardanapalus rioting, and insulting those under them.

<p>Such is the state of matters on board your ship, most sa­ <lb/> pient Timokles ; -whence those innumerable shipwrecks. Now <lb/> if any captain were in command, and observed and ordered <lb/> each particular thing; in the first place, he would not be ig­ <lb/> norant who are the good, and who the bad among the ship's <lb/> company; in the next place, he would suitably distribute to <lb/> each his proper post-the better place, up above by his side, to <lb/> the better men, and the lower place to the inferior; and some <lb/> of the superior men he would admit to his own table, and <lb/> appoint them to be of his council; and of the sailors, the most <lb/> zealous would have been appointed to the care of the forepart <lb/> of the vessel, or to the captaincy of the forecastle,1 or, cer­ <lb/> tainly, in a place above the rest: while the sluggish and negli­ <lb/> gent would be corrected a dozen times in the day with the <lb/> rope's end about his shoulders. So, admirable Sir, this <lb/> .simile of yours of the Ship is in some danger of being com­ <lb/> pletely wrecked, from having chanced upon this incom­ <lb/> petent captain.</p> 
<p>Momus. This contest proceeds swimmingly for Damis <lb/> now, and he is being borne onwards full sail to victory.</p>

<p>Timokles. Then, since my comparison of the ship appears <lb/> to you to be of no such great weight, listen now to the <lb/> “sacred anchor,"2 as the proverb has it, which you will <lb/> not shatter by any possible means.</p> 
<p>Zeus (all attention). Whatever in the world is he going <lb/> -to say, then ?</p> 
<p>Timokles. Well, you shall see if I put these arguments <lb/> into syllogistic sequence, and if you can overturn them <lb/> anyhow. If there are altars there are also Gods: but there <lb/> are certainly altars ; there are, therefore, Gods.3 What do <lb/> you say to that ?

<p>Damis (calmly). Yes, Timokles; for you, like those who <lb/> are getting the worst of it, you have sought refuge at the <lb/> altars.

<p>[Cyniskus, a Cynic philosopher (as his name imports), en­ <lb/> couraged by Zeus to ask a favour, protests that his request <lb/> will be a very modest one and very easy to grant: he is not 
<note type="footnote"> 1 <foreign xml:lang="grc">Ζεὺς 'Ελεγχομέονος</foreign>—“ Zeus Convicted," " Confuted," or " Cross-Examined." Of this Dialogue Wieland remarks :—" Never, probably, <lb/>
had any writing a more appropriate title than this, in which Jupiter, <lb/> in a tête-à-tête, is forced by the straightforward and undaunted Cynic, <lb/> in a way such as, probably, he had never yet experienced from any son <lb/> of Earth, to confess the truth. The worst blow, to which dogmas, that <lb/> are not grounded upon Reason, can be submitted, is when one holds up <lb/> their mutual contradictions to the light. One spares oneself, by this <lb/> means, the trouble of refutation, and can calmly see them, like the <lb/> armed men sown by Kadmus, annihilate themselves. This is the spec­ <lb/> tacle which Lucian gives us, in this Dialogue, in his best manner. </note> 
<note type="footnote"> " The inconsistencies of the Pagan doctrines of a Fate, of the Provi­ <lb/>
dence of their Gods, and of the system of Rewards and Punishments <lb/> after death, appears in it in a light, by whose brilliance Jupiter himself <lb/> is quite dazed and reduced to silence ; or, what is still more humiliating, <lb/> to so miserable a shift, that Cyniscus himself, at last, out of mere pity, <lb/> and content with having deprived him, after complete overthrow in open <lb/> field, of his power, his dignity, and his kingdom, and leading him in <lb/> triumph mortally wounded, presents him with his life for so long as in <lb/> the course of Nature it might be expected to last. The questions which <lb/> he lays before Jupiter had, in fact, been already debated in the Jupiter <lb/> in Tragedy, between Damis and Timokles, not to the advantage of the <lb/> party of the Gods. But Lucian, as it seems, held it to be necessary to <lb/> deliver a last decisive assault. Jupiter had to be driven out altogether <lb/> from his last lurking-holes, and to be convicted of his wicked deeds so <lb/> completely, that the most shameless sycophant must blush any longer <lb/> to undertake his defence. This it is, that Lucian, as it seems to me, in <lb/> this little Dialogue, in so masterly a way, and with so much fineness of <lb/> touch, manages to effect, that I know no more complete example of the <lb/> transformation of the antipodes of reason (as Homer expresses it) ' into <lb/> earth and water.'" </note> 
<pb n="210"/>
 going to petition for wealth or power, but simply for en­ <lb/> lightenment on certain perplexing points of theology and <lb/> metaphysics. He begins with a request to be informed as <lb/> to the truth of the statements of Homer and Hesiod <lb/> respecting the Fates, and their absolute control over human <lb/> life. Zeus assures him of their omnipotence. The apparent <lb/> contradictions of the Hellenic Scriptures are easily ex­ <lb/> plained by the circumstance that their inspiration had not <lb/> been constant: that, when those theologian-poets spoke of <lb/> their own free motion, they were, like ordinary mortals, <lb/> liable to error ; but everything uttered by them under <lb/> direct inspiration of the divinities is entirely to be received.</p> 
<p>Cyniskus then inquires whether Zeus himself acknow­ <lb/> ledges subjection to the Fates, to Chance or Fortune (also <lb/> the object of the popular Creed) ; and, upon the assent of <lb/> the " King of Gods and men," he proceeds to quote the <lb/> well-known passage in the Iliad on the " Golden <lb/> Chain,”and, sarcastically, remarks that the Fates themselves <lb/> more justly might boast of suspending him in mid-air. <lb/> Becoming more and more uneasy at every new question, <lb/> Zeus professes himself to be at a loss to divine at what his <lb/> interlocutor is driving. Nor is his alarm without some <lb/> reason, since the Cynic next inquires the purpose of the <lb/> hecatombs of slaughtered victims for the altars, and of all <lb/> the costly sacrifices ? Instead of direct reply, Zeus takes <lb/> occasion to denounce the philosophers and sophists, and their <lb/> well-known impiety. Pressed on the question of utility, <lb/> he defends the sacrificial system upon the pretext of its <lb/> being an outward and visible sign of respect and honour <lb/> on the part of men for what is greater and nobler than <lb/> themselves. To which the Cynic retorts that one of these <lb/> wicked philosophers might be disposed to ask in what con­ <lb/> sists the superiority of the Gods, seeing that they are sub­ <lb/> ject and subordinate to Fate : for the accident of " immor­ <lb/> tality," so far from being an advantage, retains them in <lb/> everlasting servitude. Nor, if the Hellenic theology was <lb/> to be believed, could it be said that all divinities are in <lb/> enjoyment of so much happiness-a positiorrwhich Cyniskus <lb/> illustrates by some conspicuous examples. Zeus now resorts <lb/> to indirect menaces, and angrily hints at some supernatural <lb/> punishment of the audacious sceptic: but the philo­ <lb/> 
<pb n="211"/>
 sopher calmly expresses his confidence that he can suffer <lb/> nothing which has not been, by the Fates or Destiny, fore­ <lb/> ordained. Besides, he observes that not even the most <lb/> audacious insulters of the Gods themselves-the many <lb/> plunderers of their temples-seem to be any the worse off <lb/> for their sacrilege, while the innocent frequently fall victims <lb/> to the indiscriminating thunderbolts.</p> 
<p>Driven to bay, the champion of the orthodox Olympian <lb/> theology reprobates the philosopher as one of those who <lb/> are for destroying all idea of a divine providence ; Cyniskus <lb/> inquires who or what is Providence, and how exercised, and <lb/> is told that he is becoming grossly impertinent; but he <lb/> extracts the reluctant admission that the Gods, after all, <lb/> are nothing but the agents and ministers of Destiny. Zeus, <lb/> however, attempts to rescue himself and his colleagues from <lb/> the consequent position of utter superfluousness and con­ <lb/> tempt by claiming credit for oracles and prophecies. The <lb/> Cynic retorts, of whafuse are warnings against the inevitable <lb/> -to say nothing of the ambiguous and misleading cha­ <lb/> racter of these divine oracles. Zeus makes some feeble <lb/> attempt at an apology, and then, not obscurely, threatens <lb/> the dernier ressort of the most forcible of his arguments-the <lb/> thunderbolt. Cyniskus tauntingly remarks that what is <lb/> fated is fated-and he is quite prepared to receive the in­ <lb/> evitable. He wishes to know how it happens that such <lb/> men as Aristeides, Sokrates, Phokion, suffered, while the <lb/> tyrants of the world, for the most part, have been allowed <lb/> to flourish. That is easily answered, rejoins the king <lb/> of Gods, for are not men to receive their deserts in a future <lb/> life ? His unrelenting tormentor retorts once more that, <lb/> for his part, he would rather escape certain misery and <lb/> suffering in this life than have the offer of not altogether <lb/> certain happiness in another state of existence. But, con­ <lb/> tinues the Cynic, if Fate or Predestination, ordain and <lb/> control everything, how, in fine, can there be any logical <lb/> place for a Minos to distribute rewards and punishments ? <lb/> Zeus disdains to answer so captious a question, and <lb/> stigmatizing his satirical examiner as impudent and sophis­ <lb/> tical, abruptly leaves him. As a parting shot, the <lb/> Cynic bawling after him desires to learn, particularly, <lb/> where, after all, these Fates are to be found-or how they <lb/> 
<pb n="212"/>
 manage to transact so enormous an amount of business, with <lb/> their extremely limited number, and ventures to think that <lb/> they themselves must have been born under a not too <lb/> propitious destiny. As for himself, he professes himself <lb/> quite satisfied with the information he has extracted from <lb/> the highest authority, and contents himself with the reflec­ <lb/> tion, that, as for the points upon which he had failed to <lb/> receive information, it was, apparently, not in " the fateS ” <lb/> that he should be enlightened.]</p>

<p>Cyniskus (with wallet and tattered cloak). I will not <lb/> trouble you, Zeus, about such matters-asking for wealth, <lb/> gold, and kingdoms, which are objects most fervently <lb/> prayed for by the rest of the world, and which are not <lb/> altogether easy for you to grant. I observe, indeed, that <lb/> you generally turn a deaf ear to their prayers.1 But there <lb/> is one thing, and that a very easy thing to grant, I did <lb/> wish to obtain from you.</p> 
<p>Zeus. What is that, Cyniskus ? For you shall not fail <lb/> to get it, especially since, as you say, it is a modest favour <lb/> you ask.</p> 
<p>Cyniskus. Just give me an answer in regard to a certain <lb/> not difficult question.</p> 
<p>Zeus. Your petition, of a truth, is a small matter and <lb/> soon settled : so ask whatever you have a mind to ask.</p> 
<p>Cyniskus. Here it is then, Zeus. You read, doubtless, <lb/> you as well as the rest, the poems of Homer and Hesiod. <lb/> Tell me, pray, are those things true which these poets have <lb/> so magnificently declaimed about Destiny and the Fates­ <lb/> that whatever lot they spin out for each mortal, at his <lb/> birth, is not possible to be avoided ? 2</p> 
<p>Zeus. Indeed, all that is quite true : for there is nothing

 that the Fates do not ordain; but all things that happen, <lb/> whatever they are, are turned upon their spindle; and they <lb/> have, each one of them, their final event, from the very <lb/> first, strictly determined: nor is it possible or right for it <lb/> to be otherwise.</p> 
<p>Cyniskus. Then, when the same Homer, in another part <lb/> of his poem, says : <lb/> " Lest to the house of Aides, despite of Fate, he send thee,”1 <lb/> and that sort of thing, we must say, I suppose, that he is <lb/> then talking nonsense ?</p> 
<p>Zeus. Certainly. For nothing could happen so, inde­ <lb/> pendently of the law of the Fates-nothing beyond the <lb/> stretch of their thread. But, as for the poets, whatever <lb/> they sing under the constraining inspiration of the Muses, <lb/> that is truth : when, however, the Goddesses desert them, <lb/> and they poetize of themselves, on such occasions, I say, <lb/> they are liable indeed to error, and are apt to contradict <lb/> their former assertions. And they may be pardoned, if, as <lb/> they are but men, they don't know the truth, after it has <lb/> left them, which, so long as it was present, poured forth its <lb/> strains through them.</p> 
<p>Cyniskus. Well, we will say so then. But further <lb/> answer me this, too. Are there not three Fates—Klotho, <lb/> Lachesis, and Atropos ?</p> 
<p>Zeus. Of course.</p> 
<p>Cyniskus. Destiny,2 then, and Chance-for they, too, are

<p>Zeus. It is not permissible for you. to know everything, <lb/> Cyniskus. And with what purpose, pray, did you ask <lb/> this question about the Fates ?</p> 
<p>Cyniskus. I will tell you, if you will tell me first, Zeus, <lb/> this too-do they govern you, as well; and is it, really, a <lb/> matter of necessity for you to hang suspended by their <lb/> thread ?</p> 
<p>Zeus. It is matter of necessity, Cyniskus. But why <lb/> did you smile, pray ?2</p> 
<p>Cyniskus. I called to mind those verses of Homer, in <lb/> which you have been represented by him as declaiming in <lb/> the popular Assembly of the Gods, when you threatened 
<note type="footnote"> 1 <foreign xml:lang="grc">Ται̃ς Μοίραις</foreign>—the Latin Parcæ. The Latins gave these dread <lb/>
divinities the names of Nona, Decuma (or Decima), and Morta (or <lb/> Moera), according to an authority quoted by Genius, iii. 16. The ety­ <lb/> mology of both <foreign xml:lang="grc">Μοι̃ραι</foreign> and Parcæ seems to be the same, and to denote <lb/> the distributive or apportioning powers. </note> 
<note type="footnote"> 2 “ Here, too, Jupiter answers conformably to the Homeric and <lb/>
popular Theology, which makes the Gods dependent on Fate (Schicksal), <lb/> or Necessity (Nothwendigkeit), and, also, even upon the Pares, who <lb/> execute the laws of Necessity. As, however, nothing was firm or stereo­ <lb/> typed in the Greek Theology, the common belief did not hinder many, <lb/> to whom the consequences of such teaching were a stumbling-block, from <lb/> thinking otherwise. Pausanias, where he speaks of the statues of Jupiter <lb/> Olympius at Megara, gives as the reason why the Horæ and Parcæ are <lb/> represented hovering above the God's head, that it was pretty generally <lb/> recognized that Pepromene (‘Fate’), is subject to Jupiter alone, and <lb/> that the Horcæ are ruled by him, and kept in due order. But Lucian's <lb/> Jupiter, weak as he was, had, at least, so much understanding as to <lb/> know that a Necessity, subject to his absolute will, could be no Necessity; <lb/> and is, accordingly, resolved not to overstrain his power, either in regard <lb/> of the Parcæ that hover over his head at Megara, or of the statues and <lb/> altars, which, according to the testimony of Pausanias, he possessed <lb/> here and there under the name of Moiragetes (' Ruler of the Fates'): <lb/> but, rather, with a good grace confessed that not only could he not alter <lb/> the laws of Fate, but that he was, as regards his own person, subject to <lb/> them. Lucian could with so much the greater justice make his Jupiter <lb/> confess this, because the Delphic Apollo himself, when Kroesus bitterly <lb/> reproached him after the unlucky event of his war with Cyrus, excused <lb/> himself in the same way (Herod. i. 91).”—Wieland. </note> <lb/>

 them to suspend the universe by a certain golden chain­ <lb/> for you asserted that, of yourself, you would let down the <lb/> chain in question from Heaven, and that all the Gods to­ <lb/> gether, if they chose, might hang. by it and use all their <lb/> force to pull it down, but that they certainly would not <lb/> drag the chain down, whereas you yourself, whenever you <lb/> wished, easily <lb/> " Aloft could draw the Earth itself, and Sea, and all within them.”1</p> 
<p>On those occasions, I confess, you appeared to me to be <lb/> admirable in your strength, and I used to shudder with <lb/> terror while I listened to those verses; whereas now I see <lb/> that all this time you have been yourself suspended <lb/> with your chain and all your threats, by a slight thread, <lb/> as you admit. Klotho, it seems to me, according to <lb/> this, might boast with far more justness, as it is she <lb/> who drags up and hangs you in mid air by her spindle, <lb/> for all the world as fishermen do their little fish from their <lb/> rod and line.</p> 
<p>Zeus (indignantly). I don't know what these same ques­ <lb/> tions of yours mean.</p> 
<p>Cyniskus. This, Zeus—and, by the Fates and by Destiny, <lb/> do not hear me with harsh or angry feeling, if I speak the <lb/> truth with freedom. Why, if this is so, and the Fates <lb/> rule all things, and nothing of what has once been decreed <lb/> by them can be altered by anyone, with what purpose do we <lb/> men offer sacrifices and present whole hecatombs to you,2 with <lb/> prayers for good things from you. For I don't see what <lb/> advantage we could get from this piece of attention, if <lb/> neither it is possible for us to find, through vows and prayers, <lb/> means of averting evils, nor to obtain any heaven-given good.

<p>Zeus (vehemently). I know where you get those pretty <lb/> questions from-from those cursed sophists, who assert that <lb/> we don't even exercise any providential superintendence <lb/> over men ; and without doubt, they ask such questions <lb/> out of sheer impiety, diverting the rest of mankind from <lb/> sacrifice 1 and vow-making, as being quite useless : seeing, <lb/> as they affirm, we neither pay any regard to what is done <lb/> among you, nor, in fine, have any power at all in respect <lb/> to earthly affairs. However, they shall have no reason to be <lb/> pleased by their pursuance of such inquiries.</p> 
<p>Cyniskus (calmly). No, by the spindle of Klotho, I declare, <lb/> Zeus, it was not from being influenced by those people that I <lb/> put these questions to you ; but our line of discussion itself, <lb/> I don't know how, has gone on till it ended in this-that <lb/> sacrifices are supererogatory and superfluous. But again, if <lb/> you please, I will put the question to you briefly, and do <lb/> not shrink from answering me, and be so kind as to give <lb/> a more candid reply than is your wont.</p> 
<p>Zeus. Ask away, if you have leisure to talk such trifling <lb/> nonsense.</p> 
<p>Cyniskus. You affirm that everything is done by the <lb/> Fates ?</p> 
<p>Zeus. Well, I do.</p> 
<p>Cyniskus. But that it is in your power to alter their <lb/> decrees, and to spin them back ?</p> 
<p>Zeus. Not at all.</p> 
<p>Cyniskus. Would you have me, then, lead up to the <lb/> necessary consequence, or is it plain enough without my <lb/> mentioning it ?</p> 
<p>Zeus. Ob, quite plain. But those who sacrifice, do so, <lb/> not on account of any need for it—to make a return, and, <lb/> as it were, to purchase good things from us; but, in a <lb/> particular manner, out of honour for what is superior to <lb/> themselves.2

<pb n="217"/>
 
<p>Cyniskus (triumphantly). That's sufficient—since even <lb/> you allow that the sacrifices are of no earthly use, but are <lb/> offered simply by way of friendly feeling on the part of men, <lb/> who honour the superior power. Yet if any one of those <lb/> sophists you speak of were present, he would ask you why <lb/> you affirm the Gods to be superior, and that, seeing they <lb/> are fellow-slaves with men, and under subjection to the <lb/> same mistresses-the Fates. For the plea of immortality <lb/> will not avail them, so as, on that account, to gain the re­ <lb/> putation of superiority: because that accident, in fact, <lb/> makes it far worse for them, seeing that death would have <lb/> removed them to a state of freedom; while, as it is, your <lb/> business ends only with infinity, and your slavery, wound <lb/> up with that long-reaching thread, is everlasting.</p> 
<p>Zeus. But, Cyniskus, that eternity and that infinity of <lb/> ours is a blessed one for us, and we live in the enjoyment <lb/> of all good things.</p> 
<p>Cyniskus. Not all of you, Zeus. On the contrary, even <lb/> among you your concerns have been variously portioned <lb/> out, and considerable confusion exists in your midst. Tou, <lb/> indeed, are fortunate, for you are king, and can hoist up <lb/> Earth and Sea by just letting down a bucket-rope, as it <lb/> were. But Hephæstus now, he is lame, and a sort of <lb/> mechanic and blacksmith by trade ; as for Prometheus, he <lb/> was once upon a time crucified1—and as for your own <lb/> father, what shall I say of him, who is still a prisoner in <lb/> chains in Tartarus ? They do say that you Gods even <lb/> play the gallant, and get wounded in battle, and sometimes <lb/> work with men as slaves, as certainly did your own brother <lb/> with Laomedon, and Apollo with Admetus. These circum­ <lb/> stances don't seem to me to be very happy ones; on the <lb/> contrary, some individuals among you appear to be for­ <lb/> tunate and lucky, and others the opposite. I omit, in fact, <lb/> to mention that you are apt to fall among thieves,2 just <lb/> as we are, get robbed by plunderers of your temples, and

 from a state of the greatest wealth become paupers, in the <lb/> twinkling of an eye. And many before now have been <lb/> melted down, for all their being of gold or silver; to whom, <lb/> I presume, that fate had been destined.</p> 
<p>Zeus (frowning). There! These, now, are mere wanton <lb/> insults of yours, Cyniskus. Indeed, you will repent of <lb/> them some time or other.</p> 
<p>Cyniskus. Spare your threats, Zeus, as you know that I <lb/> shall suffer nothing, which has not been determined by <lb/> Fate before you had anything to do with it: since I notice <lb/> that not even the robbers of your temples themselves are <lb/> all punished; on the contrary, the majority of them get <lb/> away from you scot-free. In fact, I suppose it had not <lb/> been fated for them to be caught.</p> 
<p>Zeus. Did I not say that you are, without doubt, one of <lb/> those fellows who are for doing away with providence by <lb/> your style of argument ?</p> 
<p>Cyniskus. You are terribly afraid of them, Zeus, I don't <lb/> know why. Everything, in fact, I say, whatever it may <lb/> be, you suspect to be their teaching. But I—from whom <lb/> else should I learn the truth rather than from you ?—I <lb/> should be glad to ask you this, too, who is this " Provi­ <lb/> dence " 1 of yours ; is it some Fate, or a divinity even above <lb/> her,2 as it were, ruling over the Gods themselves ?</p> 
<p>Zeus. I told you already before that it is not lawful or <lb/> proper for you to know everything. And you, although at <lb/> the beginning you said you would ask a certain single <lb/> question, don't stop a moment, putting a number of hair­ <lb/> splitting subtleties to me ; and I see it is the chief aim of <lb/> your discourse, to prove we exercise no providential care <lb/> over human concerns in anything.</p> 
<p>Cyniskus. That is not my affair : but you affirmed, a little <lb/> before, that they are the Fates that accomplish everything; <lb/> unless, perchance, you repent of making those concessions, 
<note type="footnote"> 1 <foreign xml:lang="grc">Πρόνοια</foreign>. " So the Stoics named ‘ Providence' (die Forschung), which <lb/>

<pb n="219"/>
 and recall again what you have said, and put in a claim <lb/> for " Providence," and thrust Destiny aside altogether.</p> 
<p>Zeus. By no means ; on the contrary, it is Fate that <lb/> brings each thing to pass through our agency.</p> 
<p>Cyniskus. I understand. You say you are a kind of <lb/> agents and ministers of the Fates. But, however, even so, <lb/> it would be they who exercise providence, while you are, <lb/> as it were, a sort of tools and instruments of theirs.</p> 
<p>Zeus. How ?</p> 
<p>Cyniskus. How ? Why, just as, I suppose, the carpenter's <lb/> axe and auger work together, in some sort, for the crea­ <lb/> tion of the work: but no one would say that they are the <lb/> workman himself, nor the ship the work of the axe or the <lb/> auger, but of the shipwright. Analogously, then, Destiny <lb/> is she who acts as the shipwright in regard to each parti­ <lb/> cular, while you are, I presume, the axes and augers of <lb/> the Fates : and, as it seems, men ought to offer their sacri­ <lb/> fices to Destiny, and demand their good things from her; <lb/> whereas they approach you, honouring you with their <lb/> processions and sacrifices. And yet they would not do it <lb/> reasonably, even in honour of Destiny. For I don't <lb/> suppose it to be possible even for the Fates themselves to <lb/> change or upset anything of what has been originally de­ <lb/> creed respecting each several event. At all events, Atropos1 <lb/> would not tolerate it, if anyone were to turn back the <lb/> spindle, and undo the work of Klotho.</p> 
<p>Zeus. And do you, Cyniskus, now require that not even <lb/> the Fates be held in honour by men? Well, you seem to <lb/> have for your object to throw everything into confusion. <lb/> We, however, if for nothing else, should be justly honoured, <lb/> at least, for our giving out oracles and predicting every <lb/> particular thing which has been determined by the Fates.</p> 
<p>Cyniskus. Upon a survey of the whole matter, it is use­ <lb/> less, Zeus, for those to whom it is altogether impossible to <lb/> guard themselves against them, to foreknow events that are <lb/> to take place; unless you say this-that one who has <lb/> learned beforehand that he will have to die by an iron <lb/> spear-head, might be able to escape death by shutting him­ <lb/> self up. But that is impossible : for Fate will drag him 
<note type="footnote"> 1 .As her name implies, the irreversible one, " with whom is no vari­ <lb/>
ableness, neither shadow of turning." </note> <lb/> 
<pb n="220"/>
 out to set him hunting, and will deliver him up to the <lb/> spear; and an Adrastus will hurl his javelin against the <lb/> wild boar, and will miss him, but will slay the son of <lb/> Kroesus ; just as though the javelin had been carried <lb/> against the youth by irresistible command of the Fates. <lb/> The saying of Laius is, indeed, ridiculous, which says :­ <lb/> 
<quote><l>" Sow not, in heav'n's despite, a field of sons :</l>

<l>Sure death you'll meet from your own progeny."1 </l></quote> <lb/>

<lb/>
For an exhortatory warning against events that will cer­ <lb/> tainly so happen is, I imagine, superfluous. So, in fact, <lb/> after the oracle, he did "sow," and the progeny" slew <lb/> him. Therefore, I don't see upon what pretence you demand <lb/> pay for your oracular art. Why, I omit to mention that <lb/> you Gods are accustomed to return to the majority of <lb/> your clients oracular responses of double and ambiguous <lb/> meaning, and don't make it over clear, whether the one <lb/> who crosses the Halys will destroy his own kingdom, or <lb/> that of Cyrus:2 for the oracle might be made to mean <lb/> both.</p> 
<p>Zeus. Apollo, Cyniskus, had some cause for anger against <lb/> Krcesus, inasmuch as he tempted him by boiling lamb's <lb/> flesh and a tortoise together.3</p> 
<p>Cyniskus. As a God, he ought not even to have been angry: <lb/> but, however, it had been fated, I presume, for the Lydian <lb/> that he should be deceived by the oracle; and, besides, <lb/> Destiny spun for him, that he should not understand too <lb/> clearly what was in store for him. So even your oracular <lb/> art is her work.</p> 
<p>Zeus. And do you leave nothing for us, but are we Gods <lb/> without any purpose, and do we not import any sort of <lb/> providence into human affairs, and are we, like a lot of axes <lb/> and augers, in actual fact, unworthy of sacrifices ? Indeed, <lb/> I think you quite reasonably have a supreme contempt for

<p>Cyniskus. Shoot away, Zeus, if it has been fated for me <lb/> to be struck by a thunderbolt; and I will not blame you at all <lb/> for the stroke, but Klotho, who wounds me by your agency: <lb/> for I would not affirm even that the thunderbolt was the <lb/> cause of the wound. However, I will ask. this of you— <lb/> yourself and Destiny-and do you answer me, also, on her <lb/> behalf ; for you reminded me by your threat: Why ever <lb/> in the world do you leave alone robbers of your temples <lb/> and pirates, and such a number of insolent wrong-doers, <lb/> and men of outrage and violence, and perjurers, and fre­ <lb/> quently cast your bolt against some poor oak, or rock, or <lb/> mast of a ship that has done you no harm ; and, at times, <lb/> against some good and just traveller ?1 Why are you <lb/> silent, Zeus ? Or is it not lawful and right for me to <lb/> know even thus much ?</p> 
<p>Zeus. Why, no, Cyniskus; and you are a meddlesome <lb/> sort of fellow, and I don't know where you come from with <lb/> these jumbled-up arguments.</p> 
<p>Cyniskus. Then may I not even ask you this—you, I <lb/> mean, and Providence and Destiny-why ever did Phokion, <lb/> that good man, die in such poverty and want of the actual <lb/> necessaries of life,2 and Aristeides before him ; while Kal­ <lb/> lias and Alkibiades, youths unbridled in their licentious­ <lb/> ness, abounded in wealth, and Meidias, the insolent upstart,

<p>Zeus. Why, don't you know, Cyniskus, what punish­ <lb/> ments the wicked endure after this life, or in how much <lb/> happiness the good pass their time ?</p> 
<p>Cyniskus. You talk tome of Hades, and the Tityuses and <lb/> Tantaluses.

Because we men do nothing of our own wills, <lb/> but are compelled by some inevitable necessity, if, at least, <lb/> those things are true which have been before admitted— <lb/> namely, that Fate is the cause of everything. In fact, if a <lb/> man commit a murder, she is the real murderess; and if <lb/> he rob a temple, he does what it has been ordered him to <lb/> do.

 of a caution from Zeus to except certain privileged per­ <lb/> sonages from his indictment) to insinuate that the case of <lb/> the “ king of Gods and men " himself is not unobnoxious <lb/> to severe criticism-in particular, in regard to certain <lb/> events in the island of Krete, the scene of his education <lb/> and (alleged) decease ; and his notorious amours with <lb/> certain terrestrial mistresses, which were at once hazardous <lb/> and ridiculous. He does not omit to descant upon a <lb/> number of other notorious scandals caused by the too free <lb/> conduct of other deities of either sex, in imitation of their <lb/> father and sovereign lord. At the urgent interposition <lb/> of Zeus, passing over the Ganymede scandal, he next <lb/> attacks the Oriental, and especially Egyptian, interlopers ; <lb/> and, again called to order, passes on to the various oracular <lb/> divinities, and their portentously-increasing number-in­ <lb/> stancing certain well-known athletes, who had received <lb/> the honours of divinity and immortality. One of the <lb/> results of this extension of the celestial franchise, accord­ <lb/> ing to the Censor, is the increase of perjury. Descending <lb/> rapidly to human concerns, he severely assails the new­ <lb/> fangled names bandied about in the logomachies, and <lb/> word-twisting of the " philosophers;" and has a fling at <lb/> the new fashion of deifying Nature and Destiny, &amp;c., which <lb/> threatens to divert the old-accustomed rich sacrifices from <lb/> Heaven to Earth. At this point of his oration, observing <lb/> signs of weariness from some, of hostility from others, <lb/> Momus brings his address to a somewhat abrupt close. <lb/> Leave having been given by the President, he then reads <lb/> the resolution.</p> 
<p>The Decree sets forth, in the approved (Attic) legal <lb/> forms, the principal cause of the convocation of the <lb/> Assembly—viz., the intrusion of spurious and barbarous <lb/> interlopers, the overcrowding of Heaven, and the conse­ <lb/> quent alarming and extraordinary rise in the market­ <lb/> prices of their ambrosia and nectar, and the arrogance <lb/> and presumption of the dieux nouveaux. It announces the <lb/> meeting of the celestial Chambers in the approaching <lb/> winter, when an Inquisitorial Commission is to be ap­ <lb/> pointed for thorough revision and strict scrutiny of the <lb/> claims of the several more recent and surreptitious additions <lb/> to the theocracy; when they will be expected to produce <lb/> 
<pb n="227"/>
 credentials, and proofs of the soundness of their claims : <lb/> the penalty of the flames of Tartarus to be enacted for all <lb/> who disobey the ruling of the Commission. Also, it is to <lb/> be within the powers of the same Commission to ascer­ <lb/> tain and curtail the present pluralities and patronage of <lb/> the various members of the ancien regime.</p> 
<p>To this decree Zeus vouchsafes to give his imprimatur, <lb/> and the Assembly is prorogued.]</p>

<p>Zeus. Have done with your muttering, Gods, and <lb/> don't crowd yourselves into corners, and take counsel <lb/> with one another in whispers, in your anger because <lb/> a number of unworthy guests share our table. But, inas­ <lb/> much as a Convention has been summoned to deliberate <lb/> about these matters, let each one say openly what he <lb/> thinks, and produce his charges. And you, Hermes, make <lb/> your proclamation according to the legal requirements.</p> 
<p>Hermes. Oyez ! Silence ! What God, of full age and <lb/> qualification, who has the right, desires to harangue ? <lb/> The subject of inquiry is respecting resident-aliens 1 and <lb/> strangers.</p> 
<p>Momus. I do—Momus—if you would give me leave to <lb/> speak, Zeus.</p> 
<p>Zeus. The terms of the proclamation already give you <lb/> leave. So you will have no need of my permission.</p> 
<p>Momus. I assert, then, that some of us act in a strange <lb/> manner-to whom it is not sufficient that they have been <lb/> themselves transformed from men into Gods, but, unless <lb/> they render their hangers-on and attendants possessors of <lb/> equal rights with ourselves, consider they have accom-

 plished no great or gallant achievement. Now I claim, <lb/> Zeus, from you the privilege of free speech, for otherwise <lb/> I could not venture upon it—but all know me, how <lb/> free I am of tongue, and that I could not be silent in regard <lb/> to any dishonourable action : for I examine everything <lb/> critically, and declare my opinions openly, neither fearing <lb/> anybody nor disguising my feeling out of mistaken modesty. <lb/> Thus I have the reputation with the large majority of <lb/> being a nuisance, and a calumnious character, and am <lb/> entitled by them a sort of public accuser. But, however, <lb/> as it is permitted to me, and has been so declared in <lb/> the crier's proclamation, and you, Zeus, give me power to <lb/> speak out quite freely, I will speak without any sort of <lb/> reserve. Well, there are a considerable number, I affirm, <lb/> who, not content that they themselves participate in the <lb/> same councils with us, and take part in our banquets on <lb/> equal terms with ourselves-and that, though they are <lb/> half mortals—bring up their servants and Bacchanalian <lb/> hangers-on, into the bargain, into heaven, and enregister <lb/> them as Gods.1 And now they receive the distributions of <lb/> sacrificial meats on equal terms with us, and share in our <lb/> sacrifices, without even paying us the foreigners' tax.</p> 
<p>Zeus. Give us no riddles, Momus, but speak clearly and <lb/> explicitly, and supply us with the names of the accused. For <lb/> now your statement of the case has been recklessly brought <lb/> before the public, so that one guesses at a number of indi­ <lb/> viduals, and fits one individual to one and another individual <lb/> to another of your charges. You, who are a bold and inde­ <lb/> pendent speaker, ought not to shrink from saying anything <lb/> you have to say.</p> 
<p>Momus. Bravo, Zeus, for urging me to freedom of speech : <lb/> indeed, you act in this right royally, without mistake, and <lb/> magnanimously. So I will even out with the names. <lb/> Well, that most excellent Dionysus, who is half man (not <lb/> even Greek on his mother's side, but grandson of the <lb/> daughter of a certain Syrophenician merchant, Kadmus), <lb/> ever since he was voted worthy of immortality, what sort of <lb/> character he has I say nothing-neither of his hair-fillet, <lb/> nor of his drunkenness, nor of his gait. For you all see, I

 suppose, how womanly and effeminate he is in disposition, <lb/> only half in his senses, reeking with the fumes of unmixed <lb/> wine from early morning. 1 He introduced among us a <lb/> whole tribe of his relations, and comes and brings his troop <lb/> of dancers, and makes Gods of Pan, and Silenus, and the <lb/> Satyrs, a set of rustics and goatherds, most of them, skittish <lb/> and goatish, and strange of form-of whom the one has horns, <lb/> and from the middle downwards, in fact, resembles his own <lb/> goat, and displays a long beard, and differs but little from <lb/> that animal; another is a bald old man, with a snub nose, <lb/> usually mounted upon an ass. He is Lydian.2 As for the <lb/> Satyrs, with their pointed ears, and bald heads, with horns, <lb/> such as grow on recently-born kids-they are by way of <lb/> being Phrygians. And they are even endowed, the whole lot <lb/> of them, with tails. You see what sort of divinities this <lb/> worthy finds for us. And, then, do we wonder that men have <lb/> contempt for us, when they see such ridiculous and pro­ <lb/> digious Gods ? I omit to mention that he brought up, too, a <lb/> couple of women-the one being his mistress, Ariadne,3 <lb/> whose crown, actually, he inserted in the circle of the stars ; <lb/> the other, a daughter of the Icarian farmer; and, what is <lb/> most ridiculous of all, Gods, even Erigone's dog, even him he <lb/> brought up, for fear the girl might be grieved, if she should <lb/> not have her accustomed play-fellow, and object of her affec­ <lb/> tion, her dear whelp. Don't these things appear to you to be <lb/> wanton impertinence, and drunken folly, and matter for de­ <lb/> rision ? Now listen, pray, to the history of the rest of them.

<p>Zeus. Don't say a word, Momus, either about Asklepius <lb/> or about Herakles—for I see what is the drift of your speech <lb/> -for as to them, one of them is a physician and cures men of <lb/> diseases, and hath “many fighters' value;”<ref n="1"/> while Herakles, <lb/> who is my son, purchased his immortality by not a few <lb/> toils. So don't bring accusations against them.</p> 
<p>Momus. I will hold my tongue for your sake, Zeus, <lb/> though I have much to say. However, if they have nothing <lb/> to show else, they still keep the marks of their fire burns.2 <lb/> And, if it were allowed me to use freedom of speech in <lb/> regard to yourself, I should have had much to say.</p> 
<p>Zeus. Indeed, you have, by all means, full leave to say <lb/> your say as far as I am concerned. But, surely, you are <lb/> not for bringing an action against me, too, as an alien for <lb/> usurping rights of citizenship ? 3</p>

 Thus much as to bastards and fraudulently-registered <lb/> Gods. For my part, when I hear, as I now do, a number of <lb/> strange names of certain qualities, which certainly are not <lb/> found with us, nor can at all agree together; at all that, <lb/> Zeus, I laugh consumedly. For where is that Virtue, so <lb/> much in the mouths of all of us, and Nature and Destiny and <lb/> Chance-without any certain existence, and empty names <lb/> of things-which have been invented by those stupid dolts, <lb/> the philosophers ? Yet, though they are plainly fictitious, <lb/> to such a degree have they influenced the fools, that not <lb/> one of them cares even to offer sacrifices to us; being well <lb/> persuaded that, even though he should present ten thousand <lb/> hecatombs, Chance would all the same effect what was de­ <lb/> creed, and what had been spun out from the first for each <lb/> individual person. I should, therefore, be glad to ask you, <lb/> Zeus, have you ever seen either Virtue, or Nature, or Fate ? <lb/> For that, in fact, you do hear them in the discussions of the <lb/> philosophers, I know, unless, indeed, you are, in a manner, <lb/> deaf, so that you don't hear their clamours. Though I <lb/> have still much to say, I shall now bring my speech to an <lb/> end. I observe, in fact, that the majority are annoyed by <lb/> my words, and are hissing: those, especially, to whom the <lb/> freedom of my address has come home.

 presidency of Zeus, and vice-presidency of Poseidon, Apollo <lb/> in the chair, Momus, son of Nux, acting as registrar,1 and <lb/> Hypnus brought forward the motion:- Whereas many <lb/> strangers, not only Hellenes, but even barbarous peoples, <lb/> not at all deserving to share our rights of Olympian citi­ <lb/> zenship, have been by some means illegally registered, and <lb/> have got to have the reputation of being deities, and have <lb/> crowded up all Heaven, so that the banqueting-hall is filled <lb/> with a tumultuous and turbulent mob, a rabble of people of all <lb/> sorts of lingos ; there is a failure in the supply of ambrosia <lb/> and nektar, so that now a half-pint of the latter is sold at a <lb/> mna,2 by reason of the number of the drinkers; and these, <lb/> with insolent audacity, have ousted the ancient and genuine <lb/> deities, and claimed the first places for themselves, contrary <lb/> to all the traditions of our constitution, and wish to have <lb/> precedence even on the Earth. Be it, therefore, decreed <lb/> by the Senate and the People, that about the winter solstice <lb/> a popular Assembly be summoned on Olympus, and seven <lb/> of the first-class Gods be elected as Inquisitors-three from <lb/> the old Senate of the time of Kronos, and four from the <lb/> Twelve, of whom Zeus shall be one. Be it further enacted, <lb/> that these Inquisitors sit enpermanence, after having taken <lb/> the customary oath-by the Styx ; that Hermes make pro­ <lb/> clamation and assemble them all together, as many as put <lb/> in their claims, as tax-payers, to a seat in the Convention; <lb/> and that they bring with them sworn witnesses under oath, <lb/> and proofs of their birth and family.

<title type="main">THE FERRY-BOAT: OR, THE TYRANT.1</title>

</head>

<p>[Charon, ready to set sail, awaits impatiently the ap­ <lb/> pearance of Hermes, who is behind time with his accus­ <lb/> tomed batch of ghosts; and gives vent to his vexation in <lb/> complaints to Klotho, his colleague. Presently, the Con­ <lb/> ductor of the Dead is seen approaching, heated and out of <lb/> breath, driving the ghosts before him. He accounts for <lb/> his delay by narrating the attempt to escape of one of his <lb/> convoy, the tyrant Megapenthes, and the difficulty of the <lb/> re-capture, which was effected only by the timely assistance <lb/> of the cynic Kyniskus (a fellow-ghost) ; and the fugitive <lb/> tyrant now appears on the scene securely fettered.</p> 
<p>Before setting sail for Hades, Klotho receives from <lb/> Hermes, and enters on his way-bill, the names, nationality, <lb/> and manner of death of the various passengers. The cynic <lb/> philosopher complains that she has unfairly neglected him ; <lb/> and declares that he had long been intending to anticipate <lb/> her decree. In contrast to the disciple of Antisthenes, <lb/> the tyrant begs long and vehemently for respite, however <lb/> brief, on various pretences, all of which are sternly rejected, <lb/> by the Fate. In the end, he is forcibly carried on board <lb/> by Hermes and Charon, aided by the Cynic, and bound to <lb/> the mast. At this stage, the cobbler, Mikyllus, comes <lb/> forward to expostulate with Klotho yet more strongly at <lb/> her long neglect of him, and, to her expressions of astonish­ <lb/> ment at his eagerness to embark, he replies by narrating, 
<note type="footnote"> 1 <foreign xml:lang="grc">Κατάπλους ἢ Τυράννος</foreign>. Strictly, " The Putting-in, or Arrival of the <lb/>
Ferry-Boat," etc. For the sake of brevity, the usual title has been <lb/> adopted here. The opening scene, it is highly probable, was suggested <lb/> to Lucian by some graphic picture. </note> <lb/> 
<pb n="238"/>
 at considerable length, his reasons for not shunning Cha­ <lb/> ron's boat; and, at the same time, confesses his previous <lb/> illusions in regard to the imagined happiness of the despot, <lb/> Megapenthes.</p> 
<p>Klotho now gives orders for weighing anchor; when the <lb/> cobbler, finding that he was to be left behind until the <lb/> next day, owing to the crowded state of the boat, struggles <lb/> hard to get on board, and, failing in the attempt, jumps <lb/> into the Styx, to get across by swimming. He is, then, <lb/> perforce, taken into the boat-a place being found for him <lb/> on the shoulders of the tyrant-which proceeds on its <lb/> voyage: while Kyniskus, like the cobbler afterwards on <lb/> landing, declares his inability to pay the small coin required <lb/> as the fare, and earns his passage by taking an oar.</p> 
<p>The tedium of the rest of the voyage he relieves by <lb/> giving the " time " to his fellow-rowers, to the tune of some <lb/> popular sea-song, and in jeering at the lamentations of the <lb/> rich passengers, in which amusement he is joined by the <lb/> cobbler. Upon landing, the cynic and cobbler join com­ <lb/> pany, and proceed arm in arm towards the tribunal of <lb/> Rhadamanthys. The Infernal Judge orders that the <lb/> various dead men be brought before him. The cynic at <lb/> once demands to be heard against the tyrant; and, after <lb/> previous satisfactory examination of himself, which results <lb/> in his receiving a passport for the Elysian Fields, he charges <lb/> Megapenthes with his foul deeds of cruelty and of debauchery. <lb/> That royal criminal is found to be covered with the stigmata <lb/> -the brand-mark, of his crimes and vices; and, to estab­ <lb/> lish the accusations of his principal accuser, the tyrant's <lb/> own lamp and bed are brought forward as witnesses. At <lb/> the suggestion of his accuser, Megapenthes, in place of <lb/> being consigned to the flames of Pyriphlegethon, is pro­ <lb/> hibited from drinking of the waters of Lethe; and his <lb/> punishment in Tartarus consists in an ever-present recol­ <lb/> lection of his evil deeds. In accordance with the terms of <lb/> his sentence, he is now dragged away by the Erinyes, and <lb/> chained by the side of another royal criminal, Tantalus; <lb/> who, as a comparatively innocent offender, had some reason <lb/> to complain of this unexpected addition to his torture.]</p>

<p>Charon (fretfully). Well, Klotho, this little craft of ours <lb/> long ago has been ready and excellently equipped for <lb/> putting to sea: for the bilge-water has been all baled out, <lb/> the mast has been hoisted, the sail spread, every one of the <lb/> oars supplied with its thong, and as far as I am concerned, <lb/> nothing prevents our hauling our little anchor aboard, and <lb/> proceeding on our voyage. But that Hermes is behind his <lb/> time, whereas he ought to have been here long since. Our <lb/> ferry-boat, therefore, as you see, has not a single passenger <lb/> on board, though it might have made the passage three <lb/> times to-day already. And it's close upon evening ;1 and <lb/> we have not yet turned over even a penny. And so, I know <lb/> very well Pluto will suspect me of laziness in the business ; <lb/> and that, though the blame lies with another. Our fine <lb/> honourable gentleman undertaker, like any mortal,2 has <lb/> himself drunk of the waters of Lethe,3 up yonder, and has <lb/> quite forgotten to return to us ; and, either he is wrestling <lb/> with his young men in the Palæstra, or playing his lyre, <lb/> or reciting some oration, and showing off his own silly <lb/> nonsense. Or, maybe, perhaps, the excellent gentleman <lb/> is practising his light-fingered art, and outwitting some <lb/> one—for that, too, is one of his accomplishments.4 And <lb/> so he takes his liberties with us, and that, while he half <lb/> belongs to our establishment.</p> 
<p>Klotho. But what would you have ? How do you know,

 Charon, whether some pressing business has not been im­ <lb/> posed on him, from Zeus wanting to use his services after <lb/> time, for some commission above ? He, too, is his lord and <lb/> master, you know.</p> 
<p>Charon. But not, Klotho, to make despotic use beyond <lb/> all fairness of a common possession ; for, we never have <lb/> detained him when he had to be off. But I know the <lb/> reason. We have only asphodel,1 and libations, and cakes, <lb/> and the offerings to the dead; 2 and all the rest gloom, <lb/> and mist, and darkness : while in heaven all is bright, and <lb/> they have large supplies of ambrosia, and abundance of <lb/> nectar. So I fancy it is pleasanter to linger with them : <lb/> indeed, he takes wing from us to the upper regions, just as <lb/> if he were escaping from some prison. But when it is <lb/> time for him to come down to us, leisurely, and with slow <lb/> enough steps, and painfully he makes the descent at last.</p> 
<p>Klotho. Don't give way to your temper, Charon, any <lb/> longer : for here is the very person himself hard by, as <lb/> you see, bringing us a number of individuals; or rather <lb/> scaring them along en masse with his rod, for all the world <lb/> like a herd of goats. But what's this? I see one of them <lb/> handcuffed, and another grinning, and one individual with <lb/> a wallet suspended from his shoulder and with a club in his <lb/> hand, staring grimly at them, and urging on the rest. And <lb/> don't you see Hermes himself in a bath of perspiration, his <lb/> feet covered with dust, and all out of breath ? His mouth, <lb/> anyway, is a regular steam-engine?3—what's this, Hermes? <lb/> what's all this hurry about, for you seem to me to be a <lb/> good deal put out ?

<p>Hermes (puffing and perspiring). What else, Klotho, than <lb/> that, from chasing this runaway sinner here, I was within <lb/> an ace of being a deserter from my ship to-day ?</p> 
<p>Klotho. But who is he ? Or what was his intention in <lb/> running away ?</p> 
<p>Hermes. That's plain enough-he preferred living. He <lb/> is some king or despot-to judge, at least, by his lamenta­ <lb/> tions, and the wailings he gives vent to ; he says he has <lb/> been deprived of vast pleasure of some sort.</p> 
<p>Klotho. Then did the fool run away, as if he could have <lb/> a longer lease of life, when his spun out thread had actually <lb/> failed ?</p> 
<p>Hermes. Run away, do you say? Why, if this most ex­ <lb/> cellent gentleman here, he of the club, had not aided me, <lb/> and we had not caught and handcuffed him, he would even <lb/> have got clean off from us altogether. From the moment, <lb/> in fact, Atropos had delivered him over to me, all the way <lb/> he resisted and struggled ; and, firmly planting his feet on <lb/> the ground, he was by no means an easy charge. Sometimes, <lb/> too, he would fall to supplications and make vehement en­ <lb/> treaty, demanding to be let off for a little, with offers of <lb/> large bribes. However, I, as you may well imagine, did <lb/> not let him off, seeing that he wanted the impossible. <lb/> Well, when we were now at the very mouth of Orcus, <lb/> while, as was my custom, I was counting over the tale of <lb/> the dead to Æakus, and he was making up their reckoning <lb/> by the ticket sent him by your sister,1 somehow or other, <lb/> without being observed, the thrice-damned fellow got clean <lb/> away. One dead man, accordingly, was wanting to the full <lb/> tale; and, says Æakus, raising his eyebrows, " Pray, <lb/> Hermes, don't practise your thievish art with everyone <lb/> you meet: you have quite enough sport in heaven; the <lb/> affairs of the Dead are managed with strict attention <lb/> to business, and by no means can they be slurred over. <lb/> The ticket, as you observe, has ' one thousand and four' <lb/> scratched on it; whereas you come to me with one short: <lb/> this won't do, unless you tell me that Atropos has cheated

 you." I, blushing at his lecture, quickly recollected what <lb/> had happened by the way; and when, after a glance <lb/> around, I saw this fellow nowhere, perceiving his flight, I set <lb/> out in pursuit with all the speed I could by the road lead­ <lb/> ing to daylight, and this most excellent person followed <lb/> me quite of his own accord. So, running at a speed as if <lb/> off from a starting line at a racecourse, we overtake him <lb/> just at Tænarum1—so nearly did he succeed in escaping us.</p> 
<p>Klotho. And we, Charon, but now were condemning <lb/> Hermes's neglect of duty !</p> 
<p>Charon. Why, pray, do we longer delay, as though we <lb/> had not wasted time enough already ?</p> 
<p>Klotho. You are right. Let them embark; and I, <lb/> with my way-bill ready in my hand, and taking my seat, <lb/> as is my custom, at the gangway, will make my diagnosis <lb/> of each of them, as he embarks-who he is, and where <lb/> he comes from, and what the manner of his death. And <lb/> do you take them from me, and pack them together, and <lb/> arrange them in regular order. And do you, Hermes, first <lb/> of all, toss in those new-born infants there ; for what could <lb/> they answer to my questions ?</p> 
<p>Hermes. There, Ferryman, is the exact number-with <lb/> the exposed infants,2 three hundred in all.</p> 
<p>Charon. A fig for your fine rich haul! You come and <lb/> bring me a lot of unripe dead !</p> 
<p>Hermes. Will you have us, Klotho, embark the unwept <lb/> next?</p> 
<p>Klotho. Do you mean the old ones ? So do. (Aside, in <lb/> disgust) Why, indeed, should I be troubled with inquiring

 into matters which happened before the days of Eukleides.1 <lb/> —You who are above sixty, you come forward now. What's <lb/> this ? Have they their ears so plugged up by age that <lb/> they don't hear me? (To Hermes) You will, likely enough, <lb/> have to take them up and bring them along.</p> 
<p>Hermes. Here, again, are this lot, four hundred all but <lb/> two-quite ready to melt in your mouth, all of them, and <lb/> full-ripe, gathered in not before it was time.2</p> 
<p>Charon. By heavens ! no, for they are all of them, already, <lb/> regular raisins</p>

Or stay; <lb/> rather, I will myself examine you by the written instruc­ <lb/> tions.

<p>Megapenthes (weeping and groaning). Is such a vast <lb/> amount of gold, then, to perish ?</p> 
<p>Klotho. It will not perish. So have no fear on that <lb/> score, at least: for Megakles,1 your cousin, will inherit it.</p> 
<p>Megapenthes. Alas ! the contumely ! My enemy, whom <lb/> through indolence I, yes I, did not put to death beforehand ?</p> 
<p>Klotho. The very same, and he will survive you forty <lb/> years, and some little time longer, into the bargain, inherit­ <lb/> ing your mistresses, and your wardrobe, and all your gold.</p> 
<p>Megapenthes. You do me wrong, Klotho, in assigning my <lb/> wealth to my greatest enemies.</p> 
<p>Klotho (scornfully indignant). Why, you, did not you in­ <lb/> herit those very things which were Kydimachus's, most <lb/> noble Sir, after having slain him, and cut the throats of his <lb/> little children before his eyes, as he yet breathed ?</p> 
<p>Megapenthes. But now they were mine.</p> 
<p>Klotho. Nay, your time for possessing them is now over.</p> 
<p>Megapenthes (coaxingly). Listen for a moment, O Klotho, <lb/> to what I desire to say to you quite in private, in no one's <lb/> hearing.—(To his fellow ghosts) Do you stand aside for a <lb/> little.—(In a whisper to Klotho) Should you suffer me to <lb/> run away, I promise to give you this day a quarter of a <lb/> million pounds sterling.2

<p>Klotho. What, ridiculous man, do you still keep your <lb/> gold and your thousands in mind ?</p> 
<p>Megapenthes. And I will throw into the bargain the two <lb/> large mixing-bowls,1 if you like, which I received after <lb/> putting Kleokritus to death, weighing each a hundred <lb/> talents of pure fine gold.</p> 
<p>Klotho. Drag away and weigh him,2 at once : for he does <lb/> not look like coming on board of his own accord.</p> 
<p>Megapenthes (to his fellow ghosts). I call you to witness <lb/> —my walls remain unfinished, and my naval docks. I <lb/> should have certainly completed them, if I had lived only <lb/> five days longer.</p> 
<p>Klotho. Don't fret yourself. Another will build them.</p> 
<p>Megapenthes. Well, then, I beg of you this, at all events, <lb/> surely reasonable request.</p> 
<p>Klotho. What ?</p> 
<p>Megapenthes. For me to live on so long as until I shall <lb/> have brought the people of Pisidia under my subjection, <lb/> and imposed tribute on the Lydians, and raised to myself a <lb/> vast monument, and inscribed on it all the great military <lb/> exploits of ray life.</p> 
<p>Klotho. Ah ! you fellow, you no longer ask for a single <lb/> day, but a respite of something like twenty years.</p> 
<p>Megapenthes. Indeed, I assure you I am prepared to <lb/> offer you securities for my speedy return. And, if you <lb/> wish it, I will hand over to you as my substitute ray <lb/> only beloved son.3</p> 
<p>Klotho. Abominable villain !—him, whom you often used <lb/> to pray you might leave behind in the world ?</p> 
<p>Megapenthes. Those vows I offered up a long time ago: <lb/> but now I see what is better.</p> 
<p>Klotho. He, too, will come to you in a little while, taken <lb/> off by the new king.

<p>Klotho. Which ?</p> 
<p>Megapenthes. I wish to know how matters will go on <lb/> after my decease.</p> 
<p>Klotho. Listen, then: for when you have heard you will <lb/> have the more anguish. Your slave Midas will have your <lb/> wife; indeed, he had an intrigue with her long ago.</p> 
<p>Megapenthes (furious). The cursed rascal, to whom, by <lb/> her persuasion, I gave his freedom !</p> 
<p>Klotho. And your daughter will be numbered among the <lb/> mistresses of the now reigning despot; and the pictures <lb/> and statues, which the city set up and dedicated to you <lb/> formerly, will all be overturned, and afford ridicule to the <lb/> spectators.1</p> 
<p>Megapenthes. Tell me, and is there not one of my friends <lb/> indignant at these proceedings ?</p> 
<p>Klotho. Why, who was your friend, or on what account <lb/> could he be so ? Are you ignorant that all, who adored <lb/> you and eulogized every one of your sayings and doings, <lb/> did so either from fear or from expectation, from love of <lb/> your power, and with their looks eagerly fixed on their <lb/> opportunity ?</p> 
<p>Megapenthes. Yet when they poured out their libations <lb/> at my dinner-parties, with loud voice they were accus­ <lb/> tomed to invoke many blessings upon my head, ready each <lb/> one of them to die for me, if it were possible.

<p>Klotho. You ask me a good many questions, when you <lb/> ought to have embarked at once.</p> 
<p>Megapenthes. One thing chokes me most of all, Klotho, <lb/> on account of which I did long just to have but one peep <lb/> again into daylight, if but for a moment.</p> 
<p>Klotho. And what is it ? It looks like something exceed­ <lb/> ingly important.</p> 
<p>Megapenthes. Karion, my domestic, as soon as ever he <lb/> perceived me to be dead, late at night went up into my <lb/> chamber, where I was lying—there being plenty of oppor­ <lb/> tunity, for there was no one even to watch over me—and, <lb/> fastening the door, enjoyed himself with my mistress Gly­ <lb/> cerium1 (and it was not, I suppose, the first time he had <lb/> made free with her <ref n="2"/>), for all the world as though nobody <lb/> was there; then, when he had satisfied his desire, fixing <lb/> his looks upon me, " You, however, you little paltry <lb/> scoundrel of a fellow," exclaims he, many a time you <lb/> inflicted blows upon me for nothing," and, suiting his <lb/> actions to his words, he began to pull my beard, and strike <lb/> me on the chaps; and, finally, making a deep expectoration, <lb/> he spat on me, with the valediction of "Go to the devil," 3 <lb/> and took himself off. I was all on fire with rage, and yet <lb/> could not do anything to him, for I was already as dry as <lb/> a bone and cold as death; and the abominable girl, when <lb/> she heard the noise of some persons approaching, rubbed <lb/> her eyes with spittle, as though she had been crying over <lb/> me; and with loud lamentations, and adjuring me by

<p>Klotho. Have done with your threats.—Nay, come on <lb/> board this instant; it is high time you appeared at the <lb/> judgment-seat.</p> 
<p>Megapenthes. And who will claim the right to cast a vote <lb/> against a royal person ?</p> 
<p>Klotho. Against a " royal person " no one, indeed; but <lb/> against a dead man Rhadamanthys himself, whom you will <lb/> presently see-a just judge, and who pronounces sentence <lb/> equitably in every case. But, just now, don't waste time.</p> 
<p>Megapenthes. Even make me, if you would, a private <lb/> person, Fate, one of the crowd of paupers, even a slave,1 <lb/> from the king that I was before—only suffer me to live <lb/> just once again.</p> 
<p>Klotho. Where is he of the club ? And you, Hermes, <lb/> help haul him within by the foot; for he would never <lb/> come on board of his own accord.</p>

<p>Klotho. And you—who are you ?</p> 
<p>Mikyllus. The cobbler Mikyllus.1</p> 
<p>Klotho. And so you are annoyed at waiting about? Don't <lb/> you see how much this prince promises to give, to be <lb/> respited for but a brief time ? I am all amazement, to <lb/> be sure, that this delay is not liked by you as well.</p> 
<p>Mikyllus. Just lend me your ear, most excellent Fate. The <lb/> kind gift of the Kyklops does not altogether delight me—the <lb/> promise, I mean, of " Outis I will last devour." 2 Whether <lb/> first or last, the same teeth, I suppose, await me. Besides, my <lb/> circumstances are not like those of the rich-for our lives, <lb/> as the saying is, are " as opposite as the two poles." 3 The <lb/> prince, indeed, seeing he had the reputation of being <lb/> happy in life, an object of dread to all, and looked up to <lb/> with awe by everyone, and has left behind such a vast <lb/> amount of gold and silver, and fine clothes, and horses, and <lb/> dinners, and handsome boys, and beautiful women, was with <lb/> good reason angry, and vexed at being torn away from them <lb/> all. For, somehow or other, the mind clings to such things <lb/> as to a sort of bird-lime, and is not willing with any good <lb/> grace to let itself go, inasmuch as it has long been fast glued <lb/> to them; or, rather, it is as if it were some unseverable <lb/> chain, by which it is their fate to be bound. Of course, <lb/> should one drag them off by force, they will howl and fall <lb/> to prayers; and, while audacious enough in other respects, <lb/> they are found out to be arrant cowards as respects this <lb/> road that leads to Hades. They turn themselves round, <lb/> forsooth, to regard what they are leaving behind ; and, like <lb/> unfortunate lovers, would like to gaze even from a distance <lb/> upon the concerns of the upper world, just as that fool did,

<p>Whereas I, seeing I had no pledge to hold me to life, no <lb/> estate, no house-property,1 no gold, no furniture, no fame, <lb/> no portraits, naturally I was quite equipped for the journey, <lb/> and when Atropos simply beckoned to me, gladly I threw <lb/> away my brad-awl, and shoe-sale-for I had a last in my <lb/> hands-and jumping up at once I followed barefooted, and <lb/> without even washing off the black dirt; rather I led the way, <lb/> with my face to the front: for there was nothing behind to <lb/> cause me to turn, and to call me back. And heaven be my <lb/> witness, now I see everything with you to be fair; for the <lb/> fact of perfect equality in honour for all, and of nobody being <lb/> superior to his neighbour, to me, at all events, appears to <lb/> be uncommonly pleasant. And I guess that debts are not <lb/> demanded of debtors hereabouts, and that there are no taxes <lb/> to pay. But what is best of all, is that there is no shivering <lb/> from winter's cold, nor sickness, nor being beaten by one's <lb/> superiors.

Up above there I used to live near <lb/> the palace of a prince, and very narrowly observed all his <lb/> actions, and he seemed to me then to be even, in a manner, <lb/> a rival of the gods. For when I saw his embroidered <lb/> purple, and the number of his attendants, and his gold, and <lb/> his bejewelled beakers, and his silver-footed couches, I <lb/> thought him happy; and, moreover, the rich steam from <lb/> the dishes prepared for his feasts tantalized me to death­ <lb/> so that he appeared quite plainly to me to be some man far <lb/> above ordinary human clay and thrice-blessed, and almost <lb/> I was going to say the handsomest man alive, and to tower

And, when I saw not <lb/> only him, but also the money-lender Gniphon, groaning <lb/> and repenting of his folly, because he had had no enjoyment <lb/> of his riches, but had died without tasting them, leaving <lb/> his wealth to the spendthrift Rhodocharis2 (for he was his <lb/> nearest relative, and by Jaw had the first claim to the <lb/> property), I did not know how to stifle my laughter; most <lb/> especially, when I remembered how pallid he always was, <lb/> and dirty, with his face full of care, and rich only for his <lb/> fingers, with which he used to count over his talents and <lb/> myriads of drachmas, scraping together little by little what <lb/> in a brief time will be squandered by the happy Rhodo­ <lb/> charis.3—But why don't we set off now ?

<p>Rhadamanthys. And who may you be ?</p> 
<p>Mikyllus. The cobbler, Mikyllus.</p> 
<p>Rhadamanthys (after minute inspection). Excellent ! <lb/> Mikyllus: perfectly clear, and without any noticeable mark. <lb/> Go you, too, by the side of Kyniskus here. Now summon <lb/> the tyrant.</p> 
<p>Hermes. Let Megapenthes, son of Lakydas, approach.— <lb/> Where are you wriggling to ? Step to the front at once. <lb/> It is you, the tyrant, I am summoning. Shove him by the <lb/> neck, and push him forward into full view, Tisiphone.</p> 
<p>Rhadamanthys. Now do you, Kyniskus, produce your <lb/> accusations, and convict him on the spot: for the man is <lb/> at your elbow here.1</p> 
<p>Kyniskus. Indeed, there was no need of words at all: <lb/> for you will very quickly know him, from his brand-marks, <lb/> what sort of character he is. All the same, I will reveal the <lb/> man's life to you by word of mouth, and will show him up <lb/> still more plainly by my account. Well, all the actions <lb/> of this thrice-cursed wretch, as a private individual, I <lb/> intend to pass by. As soon as ever, by attaching to <lb/> himself the most shameless of men, and collecting a <lb/> body-guard, he had effected a coup-d'etat, and established <lb/> himself as despot, he put to death more than ten thousand <lb/> citizens untried; and, seizing upon the property of each <lb/> one of them, and so arriving at the highest pitch of wealth, <lb/> he has omitted no shape or form of excess. He exercised <lb/> every sort of cruelty, and insolence, and wrong against the <lb/> miserable citizens, violating virgins, and foully disgracing <lb/> youths, in every way grossly insulting his subjects2 in his <lb/> drunken debaucheries. Even on the score of his arrogance,

 full-blown pride, and insolence to all who addressed him, <lb/> you could not possibly exact from him any adequate penalty. <lb/> One, in fact, could gaze at the Sun without blinking more <lb/> easily than at this man. In very truth, his ingenious in­ <lb/> ventions of cruel punishments, who did not keep his hands <lb/> off even his nearest relatives, it would be impossible for <lb/> any one adequately to expose. And these charges-that <lb/> they are not some groundless calumny against him—you <lb/> will soon know, by calling those who have been murdered <lb/> by him; or, rather, they are present now, as you see, un­ <lb/> summoned, and they surround him and are strangling <lb/> him (pointing to the shrieking ghosts). These all, Rhada­ <lb/> manthys, have died at the hand of the wretched criminal <lb/> -some by treachery, for the sake of beautiful women; <lb/> and some, because they were indignant at their sons being <lb/> carried off to be insulted by his unnatural debaucheries; <lb/> others, because they were rich; some, because they were <lb/> able, and prudent, and did not at all approve of his acts.</p> 
<p>Rhadamanthys. What say you to this, you abominable <lb/> wretch, you ?</p> 
<p>Megapenthes. I have, indeed, perpetrated the murders <lb/> which he speaks of : but all the rest-the adulteries, and <lb/> unnatural offences, and debauching virgins-in all these <lb/> respects, Kyniskus has falsely accused me.</p> 
<p>Kyniskus. Then I will bring you witnesses of these <lb/> crimes, Rhadamanthys.</p> 
<p>Rhadamanthys. Who are they you speak of ?</p> 
<p>Kyniskus. Summon, Hermes, his lamp and his couch: <lb/> for, if they appear, they will testify what sort of deeds they <lb/> were privy to his perpetrating.</p> 
<p>Hermes (making proclamation). Let the Couch and Lamp <lb/> of Megapenthes put in an appearance. (To the Court) <lb/> They have been so good as to obey the summons.1

<p>Rhadamanthys (to the new witnesses). Tell us, pray, what <lb/> you are privy to about this Megapenthes. And do you, <lb/> Couch, speak first.</p> 
<p>Couch. All the accusations of Kyniskus are true. I, how­ <lb/> ever, my lord, blush to speak of these things: such were <lb/> the deeds which he was accustomed to perpetrate upon <lb/> me.</p> 
<p>Rhadamanthys. You certainly give your evidence against <lb/> him most plainly, seeing you cannot endure even to men­ <lb/> tion the particulars.—And you, Lamp, now let us have <lb/> your evidence.</p> 
<p>Lamp. I do not know what happened by day, for I was <lb/> not present: and as to his acts and experiences by night, <lb/> I shrink from speaking of them. But I saw many inde­ <lb/> scribable things, and that surpassed all conceivable -an­ <lb/> natural debauchery; although I would willingly often have <lb/> not drunk in the oil, and I longed to be extinguished. But <lb/> he even would bring me up close to the very scene of his <lb/> acts, and would pollute my light in every possible way.</p> 
<p>Rhadamanthys. We have now had enough of witnesses. <lb/> (To the officers of the Court) Well, now, strip off this purple <lb/> dress, that we may count the number of his brandings. <lb/> —Ha ! The fellow here is livid all over, and everywhere <lb/> marked ;1 or, rather, he is black and blue from them. <lb/> In what way should he be punished ? Is he to be thrown <lb/> into the flames of Pyriphlegethon, or to be given up to <lb/> Kerberus ?</p> 
<p>Kyniskus. Not so. But, if you will permit me, I will <lb/> suggest to you a new and befitting kind of punishment for <lb/> him.</p> 
<p>Rhadamanthys. Speak, for I shall acknowledge my ex­ <lb/> treme indebtedness to you for so doing.</p> 
<p>Kyniskus. It is a custom, I believe, for all who die to <lb/> drink the water of Lethe.</p>

<title type="main">MENIPPUS: OR, THE ORACLE OF THE DEAD.1</title>

</head>

<p>[MENIPPUS, the Cynic philosopher, just returned from a <lb/> visit of inquiry to Hades, meets his friend Philonides, who <lb/> earnestly begs him to reveal the reasons, and the experi­ <lb/> ences, of his interesting journey. Thus adjured, with some <lb/> display of reluctance, Menippus, after having been assured <lb/> by his friend that human life has not at all improved <lb/> during his absence, professes that he had been impelled to <lb/> take so hazardous a journey by an ardent desire to learn <lb/> the truths of philosophy and life-vainly sought alike in <lb/> the popular Theology and in the schools of the Philo­ <lb/> sophers, or Sophists, who were all at variance one with the <lb/> other, and contradicted themselves ; while they failed to <lb/> practise their own teaching.</p> 
<p>Thus forced to trust to his own resources, after much <lb/> mental inquietude, he determines to go to Babylon, a 
<note type="footnote"> 1 <foreign xml:lang="grc">Μένιππος η̋ Νεκυομαντεία</foreign>. This Lucianic Dialogue (for its genuine­ <lb/>
ness is doubtful, as shewn, among modern critics, by Wieland and <lb/> Lehmann) borrows its alternative title from the Eleventh Book of the <lb/> Odyssey, of which it is, in great part, a parody. It is a sort of epitome <lb/> of the Dialogues of the Dead and other writings of the great master, <lb/> which satirize the popular theology respecting the Under-World, and is <lb/> of high interest as a résumé of this province of Hellenic superstition. </note> 
<note type="footnote"> Rabelais (who is indebted, especially, to the True History) borrows one <lb/>
of his most instructive scenes from this Dialogue. In the battle with <lb/> the Dipsodes, on behalf of the Amaurotes (the " shadowy " or "fleeting" <lb/> people, a name suggested to Rabelais by the Utopia of More, himself <lb/> indebted to Lucian), Pantagruel's companion, Epistemon—who loses his <lb/> head, but afterwards recovers it through the skilful surgery of Panurge <lb/> -upon returning from his temporary sojourn in Hades, reports the <lb/> altogether reversed conditions of some of the heroes of antiquity and of <lb/> later times. (Gargantua and Pantagruel, ii.) The Spanish satirist, <lb/> Quevedo, also, has obligations to the Menippus, in his Suen<foreign xml:lang="grc">̃ο</foreign>s. </note> <lb/> 
<pb n="263"/>
 principal seat of the Magi and the Mystics, and by their <lb/> occult science obtain admission to the Under-World, and, <lb/> like his prototype, Odysseus, consult the soul of the Theban <lb/> prophet Teiresias. Arrived at Babylon, Menippus intro­ <lb/> duces himself to one of these Magi, named Mithrobarzanes, <lb/> and, with considerable difficulty, obtains from him promise <lb/> of assistance. Under the tuition of the Magus, he enters <lb/> upon a course of purificatory and mystic rites, and a strict <lb/> dietetic regimen, until he is properly prepared for the <lb/> dreadful descent. Embarking on the Euphrates, they sail <lb/> to a certain secluded place, where they leave their boat, <lb/> and begin the prescribed infernal rites and sacrifices—still <lb/> faithfully following the authority of the poet of the Odyssey <lb/> -invoking Hekate, the Erinyes (or Furies), and all the <lb/> daemons. The Earth opens, and the various infernal sights <lb/> are revealed. Descending, with much difficulty, the travellers <lb/> secure places on board Charon's boat, already overladen <lb/> with dead men, who, for the most part, had received their <lb/> quietus in battle. The lion's skin, and mane of Herakles, <lb/> with which the Cynic had provided himself, secure for <lb/> them places on board, and a courteous reception from the <lb/> Ferryman of the Styx. Disembarking, with the Magus for <lb/> guide, Menippus makes his way, through "squealing" <lb/> ghosts, to the tribunal of Minos. There they see the various <lb/> punishments for crime and injustice administered, and a <lb/> novel sort of witnesses in the shadows of the accused. <lb/> Among those most severely punished appear the arrogant <lb/> Rich ; and Menippus does not lose his opportunity for <lb/> the exercise of his satirical faculty. Leaving the judgment-seat of Minos, they proceed to the scenes of punishment, <lb/> and view the various instruments and infliction of torture.</p> 
<p>In the Acherusian plains, they verify the accounts of the <lb/> poet of the Odyssey, as to the <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀμένηνα καρήνα</foreign>, and other <lb/> particulars. The <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἰσοτιμία</foreign> is found to be complete and in­ <lb/> dubitable. Thersites and Nireus, Irus and Alkinous, have <lb/> nothing whatever to distinguish them one from the other. <lb/> Under the influence of this spectacle, Menippus compares <lb/> human life to a gigantic public Procession, and to the <lb/> Stage, where the several constituents play their diverse <lb/> parts, for a short time, liable to extremest vicissitudes of <lb/> fortune. Mausolus, and other vain-glorious princes, with <lb/> 
<pb n="264"/>
 their " lying trophies " and inscriptions, in particular, fall <lb/> under the Cynic's satire; and the Earthly kings and <lb/> potentates who, in the Under-World, cut so abject and <lb/> inglorious a figure. As for Sokrates and Diogenes, they <lb/> still pursue their peculiar and favourite occupations. At <lb/> this point of his narrative, Menippus is reminded that he <lb/> has omitted to quote the solemn Decree against the Pluto­ <lb/> crats, passed by the Popular Assembly of Hades (to which <lb/> he had referred at the beginning of his report), the pur­ <lb/> port of which is the apportionment of a severe retribution.</p> 
<p>At the point of going back to the Upper-World, <lb/> Menippus approaches Teiresias, and begs him to reveal the <lb/> secret, which was the object of his descent. This the <lb/> prophet's ghost does with laconic brevity. The philo­ <lb/> sophers then return, by a short cut, to Earth, near to the <lb/> Cave of Trophonius.]</p>

 the decrees that have been voted against the Rich, which, by <lb/> Kerberus, there is no possible means of their escaping from.</p> 
<p>Philonides. How ? Has any very new decree been passed <lb/> by the Powers down below respecting those up here ?</p> 
<p>Menippus. Yes, so help me heaven ! and many of them : <lb/> but it's not lawful to publish them abroad to everyone, <lb/> nor to proclaim the ineffable secrets, for fear that someone <lb/> or other might bring an action against us in the Court of <lb/> Rhadamanthys for impiety.</p> 
<p>Philonides. Don't, Menippus, don't, in heaven's name, <lb/> grudge a friend the narration of those events ; for you will <lb/> speak to one who knows how to hold his tongue, and, <lb/> moreover, to one who has been initiated.</p> 
<p>Menippus. You impose upon me a hard task, and not at <lb/> all a safe one. But, however, for your sake I must run <lb/> the risk. It is decreed, I say, that these millionaires and <lb/> plutocrats, and those who carefully keep their gold coin <lb/> shut up like Danae</p> 
<p>Philonides. Don't tell me the decrees before, my good <lb/> Sir, you have recounted that which I would with most <lb/> particular pleasure hear from you—what was your inten­ <lb/> tion in making the descent, and who was your guide on <lb/> the journey? Next, in regular order, what you saw, and <lb/> what you heard among them : for it is reasonable to sup­ <lb/> pose, surely, that you as a dilettante neglected nothing of <lb/> what was worth seeing or hearing.</p> 
<p>Menippus. I must even do you this service, for what can <lb/> one do, when a gentleman and a friend urges one ? Well, <lb/> then, I will recount to you, first of all, my design, and <lb/> whence I got the impulse to make the descent. Well, I, as <lb/> long as I was in my teens, when I listened to Homer and <lb/> Hesiod recounting the wars and seditions not only of the <lb/> demi-gods, but actually even of the Gods themselves before <lb/> now ; nay, further, even their adulteries, and violences, and <lb/> rapes and feuds, their expulsions of parents, and their <lb/> marriages with sisters-all this I used to consider to be <lb/> good and right, and I tickled my fancy in no ordinary <lb/> degree with it all. But when I began to arrive at <lb/> mature age, on the contrary, I then heard the laws en­ <lb/> joining the opposite to the poets,-not to commit adultery, <lb/> nor to engage in civil war, nor to rob with violence, I <lb/> 
<pb n="267"/>
 stood fixed in great doubt and perplexity, not knowing <lb/> where I should turn myself. For, neither could I ever <lb/> believe that the Gods committed adultery, and engaged in <lb/> fratricidal war, unless they held about these things, that <lb/> they were really honourable: nor that the legislators would <lb/> encourage the opposite to these practices, unless they sup­ <lb/> posed their prohibitions to be advantageous. And, when I <lb/> continued to be in doubt, I resolved to go to those whom <lb/> they call " philosophers," and put myself in their hands, <lb/> and pray them to use me as they wished, and to point out <lb/> to me some sure and simple way of life. With this dispo­ <lb/> sition, I say, I approached them ; and I did not know that <lb/> I was forcing myself, as the adage is, from the smoke into <lb/> the fire itself.1 For plainly, upon close examination, I found <lb/> among them ignorance in a very special degree, and doubt <lb/> and uncertainty greater than elsewhere; so that very quickly <lb/> they proved to me that the way of life of the ignorant and <lb/> common sort of people was golden in comparison. One of <lb/> them would exhort me, you maybe sure, to indulge my love <lb/> of pleasure in everything, and that only to pursue by all <lb/> means: for that that was the being " happy." Another, on <lb/> the contrary, exhorted me to be laborious about everything, <lb/> and to toil, and to restrain, and torture the body, dress in <lb/> rags, live in squalor, and to make myself a nuisance to <lb/> everybody else, and use vituperative language;2 perpetually <lb/> declaiming to me those universally known verses of Hesiod <lb/> about Virtue, and toil, and sweat, and the ascent to its <lb/> summit.3 Another would exhort me to contemn money and

 to consider its possession a matter of indifference. Someone <lb/> else, again, was for proving riches themselves to be “a <lb/> Good." As for their theories of the Universe, what need for <lb/> me even to speak, who was nauseated in daily listening to <lb/> their “ideas,” incorporealities," “atoms,” "vacuums," <lb/> and a crowd of such like names ? And what was the most <lb/> absurd of all strange things was-that, while each one of <lb/> them spoke of matters most opposed one to the other, he <lb/> would supply exceedingly irresistible and persuasive argu­ <lb/> ments ; so that you could not possibly contradict either <lb/> him who affirmed the same thing to be " heat," nor him <lb/> who asserted it to be " cold "-and that, though yon knew <lb/> perfectly well that a thing could never possibly be warm <lb/> and cold at the same moment. Plainly, then, I was in <lb/> the same case with those who doze-one moment nodding <lb/> assent, at another throwing my head back in denial. But <lb/> still more unreasonable than this-by close observation, I <lb/> found these same people to follow a manner of life quite <lb/> contrary to their own precepts. Those, in fact, who urged <lb/> me to despise money, I observed to cling to it with the <lb/> firmest grasp, to be quarrelling about their usury, teaching <lb/> for pay,1 and ready to endure anything for it. And those <lb/> who were for rejecting fame, I found to be employed in all <lb/> their words and actions for its sole sake; and, further, while <lb/> accusing almost all the world of devotion to pleasure, to be, <lb/> in private, firmly attached to that alone.</p> 
<p>Deceived, then, in this expectation, I began to be yet <lb/> more disgusted; while I consoled myself, in some degree, <lb/> with the fact that I was a fool, and wandering about still <lb/> ignorant of Truth, in company with many others-learned <lb/> people, and very much famed for their knowledge : and, <lb/> as on one occasion, I was kept awake all night, on this <lb/> account, I determined upon going to Babylon to beg the <lb/> assistance of some one of their Magi, the disciples and suc­ <lb/> cessors of Zoroaster ; for I heard that by certain incanta­ <lb/> tions and mystic rites they open the gates of Hades, and

 conduct down whomever they choose in safety, and bring <lb/> them back again. I considered, therefore, the best thing <lb/> to do was, to obtain for myself the means of descent from <lb/> some of these persons, and go to Teiresias the Boeotian, and <lb/> learn from him, as he is a prophet and a sage, what way of <lb/> life is the best, and the one which any right-thinking man <lb/> would choose for himself. And, in fact, jumping up there <lb/> and then, as quickly as I could, I made straight for <lb/> Babylon. Upon my arrival I take up my residence with <lb/> one of the Chaldæans, a learned man, and of preternatural <lb/> excellence in his art, with white hair, who grew a very <lb/> venerable beard. His name was Mithrobarzanes. After <lb/> praying and earnestly supplicating him, I obtained from <lb/> him with great difficulty the favour of conducting me <lb/> on the route-upon his own terms. This gentleman taking <lb/> me to his house, in the first place, for nine-and-twenty <lb/> days, beginning immediately from the new moon, made me <lb/> perform my lustrations, conducting me down, at the first <lb/> dawn of day, to the Euphrates, and addressing some long <lb/> speech to the rising sun, which I did not very well under­ <lb/> stand : for, like incompetent criers at the games, his <lb/> utterance was rapid and indistinct. However, he seemed <lb/> to be invoking certain dæmons. After the incantation, <lb/> when he had spit three times1 in my face, I returned home, <lb/> carefully avoiding the gaze of persons I met on the road. <lb/> Our food was hard-shelled fruits,2 our drink milk and honey <lb/> and water, and the water of the Choaspes;3 and our bed was <lb/> under the open sky, upon the grass. When there had been <lb/> sufficient dietetic preparation, about midnight he would lead <lb/> me to the river Tigris and cleanse me, and wipe me dry, and

 he purified me all round with lighted torch, and squill, 1 and <lb/> several other rites, at the same time muttering the incanta­ <lb/> tion. Then, having thoroughly charmed my entire person, <lb/> and made a pass with his body round me that I might not <lb/> be injured by the ghosts, he brought me back to his house <lb/> as I was; making me walk backwards. For the rest of the <lb/> time we were engaged in preparations for our voyage. He <lb/> himself put on a certain magical robe, for the most part <lb/> like the Persian, and he brought and equipped me in these <lb/> things-the felt cap,2 the lion's skin, and the lyre, to make <lb/> them complete.

With especial severity did he treat those of them <lb/> who were swollen with pride on account of their riches and <lb/> power, and had demanded all but divine worship,3 from de­ <lb/> testation of their (short-lived) arrogance and haughtiness; <lb/> and because they did not choose to remember they were <lb/> mere mortals, and in chance possession of mortal goods. <lb/> Well, they, stripping themselves of all these splendours— <lb/> I mean their wealth, and birth, and imperial power-stood <lb/> by, perfectly naked, and with downcast looks, reflecting on <lb/> the happiness they had among us as on some dream.

Upon <lb/> hearing this, they were greatly chagrined.</p> 
<p>Meanwhile, one particular case was decided leniently by <lb/> Minos. Aristippus,1 the Cyrenian, came up—they hold him <lb/> in honour, and be has the greatest influence with those <lb/> below-and obtained the respite of Dionysius the Sikeliot <lb/> from his sentence (who had been charged by Dion with many <lb/> iniquitous crimes,2 and had been witnessed against by his <lb/> own shadow), as he was within an ace of being bound to the <lb/> Chimæra, by alleging that he had been ready and judicious in <lb/> his pecuniary gifts to several men of learning. However, <lb/> taking our leave of the tribunal, we arrive at the place of <lb/> punishment. Here, my friend, many and pitiful indeed, were <lb/> the things to be heard and seen ;3 for, at the same time, was <lb/> heard the sound of scourges, and the wailing of those who <lb/> were being roasted in the fire, and instruments of torture, and <lb/> pillories, and wheels ; and the Chimæra tore them to pieces, <lb/> and Kerberus gnawed them. All were being punished <lb/> together, kings, slaves, viceroys, poor, rich, beggars; and <lb/> all repented them of the bad deeds they had committed. <lb/> Some of them we recognized at a glance-such of them <lb/> as had recently died.

How­ <lb/> ever, with difficulty, and after a long time, by narrowly <lb/> inspecting them, we did recognize some of them. They were <lb/> lying one upon the other, shadowy, dimly seen, and obscure, <lb/> and no longer possessing anything of what are counted <lb/> beauties among us. I need not assure you, as there were <lb/> numerous skeletons lying in the same spot, all alike, and <lb/> with a sort of horrible and vacant stare, and showing their <lb/> gumless teeth, I began to be at a loss with myself how I

<p>So, of a truth, as I looked upon those things, human <lb/> life appeared to me to resemble a sort of long public pro­ <lb/> cession, and Fortune appeared to have the management of <lb/> and to arrange every particular, while she assigned to those <lb/> taking part in the Show various and variegated costumes. <lb/> One she would take, if so it chanced, and equip in royal <lb/> fashion, and put a tiara upon his head, and assign to him a <lb/> number of body-guards, and crown his head with the diadem. <lb/> Another she would clothe in the dress of a domestic. A <lb/> third individual she would decorate with beauty ; a fourth <lb/> she turned out ugly, deformed, and an object of ridicule; <lb/> for it is proper, I imagine, that the Show be composed <lb/> of all sorts and conditions of men. And frequently, even <lb/> in the midst of the procession, she would change the <lb/> costumes of some of its constituents, and not permit them to <lb/> go through with it to the end, as they had been first <lb/> arranged; but, changing the dress of a Kroesus, she com­ <lb/> pelled him to receive in exchange the dress of a domestic <lb/> and a captive: while a Mæandrius,2 who up to that time <lb/> had been among the slaves in the Show, she invested with <lb/> the despotic sovereignty of a Polykrates, and for some time <lb/> suffered him to use the dress. But, when the time for the <lb/> Show had passed, at that instant each one restoring his <lb/> paraphernalia, and putting off his dress with his body,

<p>Some, from folly, as soon as Fortune stands at their <lb/> side and demands back her decorations, are grieved <lb/> and are indignant, as though deprived of some of their own <lb/> property, and as if they were not giving up what they had <lb/> had the use of for a brief space. I suppose you have often <lb/> seen of such as are employed on the Stage, those tragic <lb/> actors, who, according to the requirements of the dramas, <lb/> become at one time Kroesus and, at another, Priam or <lb/> Agamemnon; and the same person, if chance so directs, <lb/> who imitated, a little before, very grandly the dress and bear­ <lb/> ing of a Kekrops or an Erechtheus, at the summons of the <lb/> poet, in a little while comes forward as a domestic. And <lb/> now, when the drama is at an end, each divesting himself of <lb/> that gold-embroidered garment, and laying aside his mask, <lb/> and descending from his tragic-boots, moves about in public <lb/> as a poor and humble individual, no longer Agamemnon, <lb/> the son of Atreus, nor Kreon, the son of Menoekeus, but <lb/> now called by his proper name, Polias,1 the son of Charikles, <lb/> of the borough of Sunion, or Satyrus, the son of Theo­ <lb/> geiton, of the borough of Marathon.

 it seemed to me, from his tomb as he was weighed down <lb/> from having such enormous weight of material pressing on <lb/> him.1 For, when Æakus, my friend, measures out for each his <lb/> place-and he gives at most not more than a foot2—he <lb/> must be content to lie contracted in a very moderate space. <lb/> But you would laugh, I think, much more, if you saw those <lb/> who were kings and viceroys with us acting the beggar <lb/> with them, and either selling salt herrings for want, or <lb/> teaching the rudiments of grammar, insulted by any <lb/> common person, and smitten on the cheek as if they were <lb/> the most despised of slaves.

Well, while I was staying with them, <lb/> the presiding magistrates proposed a meeting of the <lb/> Popular Assembly in respect of the common interests. As, <lb/> then, I observed a number of them running together, I at <lb/> once mixed myself up with the dead men, and forthwith <lb/> became myself, too, one of their members of Parliament. <lb/> Other matters were duly settled, and, last of all, the case <lb/> of the Rich. When, you must know, many and terrible <lb/> accusations had been brought against them-violence, ar­ <lb/> rogance, haughtiness, and injustice-at length a certain <lb/> popular leader rose, and read the Decree to this effect :-</p> 
<ab><title type="sub">THE DECREE.</title></ab>

<p>“ Whereas the Plutocrats perpetrate a number of ini­ <lb/> quities in life, by plunder, by violence, and in every <lb/> way utterly despising the Poor, be it enacted by the <lb/> Senate and the People that, when they die, their bodies <lb/> undergo punishment, just as do those of other worthless <lb/> people, but that the souls be sent up above again into life, <lb/> and enter into asses,1 until they have, in such state, passed

 through two hundred and fifty thousand years, becoming <lb/> asses from generation to generation, and carrying heavy <lb/> burdens, and driven by the poor labourers ; and after that <lb/> period, that it be permitted them finally to die.</p> 
<p>"Dryskull, the son of Skeleton, of the wardship of Dead­ <lb/> borough, of the tribe of Corpseland, proposed this bill."</p> 
<p>When this bill had been read, the magistrates gave <lb/> their votes by ballot, and the people by show of hands ; and <lb/> Brimo1 roared, and Kerberus howled; for in this way the <lb/> resolutions, that have been read, became complete and bind­ <lb/> ing. Such, I assure you, were the proceedings in the <lb/> Popular Assembly. I—in pursuance of the object of my visit <lb/> -approached Teiresias, and, after explaining everything, <lb/> begged him to tell me what sort of life he considers to be <lb/> about the best. Then with a laugh-he is a somewhat blind, <lb/> little old man, sallow, and shrill-voiced—“ My son," says he, <lb/> " I know the cause of your doubt and perplexity, that it <lb/> originated with the philosophers, who do not agree among <lb/> themselves : but it is not permitted me to reveal it to you, for <lb/> it has been forbidden by Rhadamanthys." " Oh! pray, don't <lb/> refuse, my good little father," said I, " but tell me, and don't <lb/> despise me who grope about in life blinder than yourself." <lb/> Thereupon, you must know, he took me aside and withdrew to <lb/> a considerable distance from the rest, and, quietly stooping <lb/> to my ear, he says : " The best and soundest life is that of <lb/> persons in private station. So do you, leaving off the folly <lb/> of inquiring into transcendental subtleties, and searching <lb/> into final ends and causes, and rejecting with contempt <lb/> their learned sophisms and syllogisms, and deeming such <lb/> things mere trifling and nonsense, search diligently for this <lb/> one thing alone-how, making wise use of what you have, <lb/> you may pass by with a smile of contempt most opinions, <lb/> and pursue nothing with too serious aim." <lb/> So spake he, and back he coursed through Asphodelian meadows,2 <lb/> and I—for it was now evening-" Pray, come," say I,
