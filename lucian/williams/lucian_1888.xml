<title type="main">PREFACE.</title>
</head>
<p>FOR the few ascertained facts in the life of the greatest  prose satirist and most brilliant wit of Greek and Latin  antiquity, we are indebted, almost wholly, to scattered and  incidental allusions in his own various writings.</p>
<p>Like his immediate predecessor, Menippus the satirist;  the illustrious Neo-Platonist, Porphyry, in the third; and  the orator, Libanius, in the fourth century, Lucian was  Syrian by birth. He was born at Samosata—its heap of  ruins still retains the old name almost unchanged-on the  Euphrates, not far distant from Edessa, and the chief  city of the district of Kommagene, in the extreme northeast of Syria, about the year 120 A.D. Tradition protracts  the term of his existence to the age of ninety, or even of  one hundred years. He thus lived through the reigns of  Hadrian, the two Antonines, and Commodns, and (at all  events) the earlier part of the reign of Severus—altogether the happiest period of the Roman Empire, and  one of the most interesting ages in the world's history. Of his earlier life, the brief record supplied  in his incomplete autobiographical sketch, the Dream,  so often has been repeated, that it is not necessary to  do more than to refer to it here. It is enough briefly to  repeat that the deliberations of a family council determined his parents, who were in poor circumstances, to  apprentice him, at the age of fifteen, to his maternal uncle,  a statuary, for whose art he had shown some boyish inclination ; that, by a fortunate accident-fortunate, at least,  for the world of literary, if not of plastic, Art-the breaking  of a piece of marble, he was induced to run away from his  master, in resentment at a severe flogging, and to transfer
<pb n="xiv"/>
his allegiance to Literature (Paideia1) ; or, rather, to  prepare himself, in the first instance, by a severe course  of training, for the profession of a rhetor (in modern  phrase, a public speaker), which eventually led him to embrace the career of philosophy and letters.</p>
<p>At this very early stage his memoir, unhappily, comes  to an end, and we are left to incidental remarks in his more  considerable productions. His experiences for some years  lay in the hard school of poverty and neglect (<foreign xml:lang="grc">πένης καὶ ἀφανής</foreign>). In search of employment, or, rather, to master
the rudiments of his profession, the young Lucian waindered through the cities of the south-western region  of the Lesser Asia, the celebrated and highly-cultured  Ionia, gradually getting rid of his provincial manner and  dialect, but still conspicuous by his Syrian (or, as he calls  it, Assyrian) and un-Greek style of dress (The Twice-Accused, 27). In his twentieth year he arrived in Greece,  and made his first acquaintance with the Platonic philosopher Nigrinus, who gives the title to one of his Dialogues.  He next settled in the Syrian capital, Antioch, where he  practised at the bar, and acquired considerable reputation  as a pleader ; but the chicanery and frauds of the interpreters of the laws soon caused him to abandon that pursuit (The Fisherman, 29). The skill thus gained he turned  to lucrative account as travelling disputant (sophistes, as it  was termed)-a popular and profitable calling, which was as  common in the philosophic Hellenic and Roman world in the  second century, A.D., as it was in Scholastic Europe of the  Middle Ages. In that capacity he traversed Syria and Egypt.  Soon afterwards he visited Rome (in the year 150), among  other reasons, to consult an oculist; and in his Nigrinus,  the literary result of his visit, he stigmatizes the prevailing corruptions and laborious trifling of the literary as  well as fashionable society of the capital. After a stay of  two years in Italy, he proceeded to southern Gaul, at that  time, and long previously, celebrated for its schools of

<note type="footnote" n="1"><p>The fine allegory of the rivalry of Paideia and Techne (" Trade ")
may have been suggested to him, in part, by the charming idyll of  Moschus (in which Europe and Asia appear in a dream to the daughter  of Kadmus, and contend for her possession), as well as by the Choice of  Herakles of Prodikus and Xenophon. </p></note>
<pb n="xv"/>
rhetoric. In Gaul he continued his profession of public  lecturer for some ten years, his residence in that country  being interrupted only by a visit to Olympia. During  this period, probably, he composed many of his published  rhetorical pieces.</p>
<p>Having now secured an independent income, at the age  of forty, Lucian set out again on his travels, and made a  journey through Macedonia and Thessaly, on his way to  his Syrian home. His stay at Samosata was only temporary ; and, inducing his surviving family to remove to  Athens, in the next year he himself followed them to the  literary metropolis, which to him, as to every Greek  or phil-Hellenist, doubtless was an object of supreme  intellectual curiosity. It was on his journey to Athens  that he had the interview with the Paphlagonian prophet,  Alexander, which gave birth to his satire of that name.  The contempt openly exhibited by him for that eminent  miracle-worker had almost, as he assures us (Alex. 56, 57),  cost him his life : for the exasperated Alexander had  secretly instructed the crew of the vessel, which he had  insidiously placed at his visitor's disposal, to make away  with their charge-a conspiracy frustrated only by the  interposition of the relenting captain. Thus saved from a  premature and inglorious end, he proceeded on his journey  to Athens, accompanied by that extraordinary adventurer,  Peregrinus, or Peregrinus Proteus, whose fiery immolation  of himself (like that of another Hercules Furens), before the assembled multitude at Olympia, witnessed by  Lucian, in the year 165, forms the principal subject of the  Peregrinus.</p>
<p>At Athens Lucian seems-for there is no positive evidence—to have taken up his fixed abode for the greater  part of his remaining life, occupying himself, as may safely  be conjectured, in the highest philosophical and literary  studies, and in the enjoyment of the friendship of such  exceptional philosophers as Celsus, the famous Platonist-critic of nascent Christianity (in his True Account, known  to us only through the Reply of Origen, published fifty  years later), of the Stoic Sostratus, and the Eclectic Bemonax. His sketch of the career of the last, a meritorious  ethical teacher, forms one of the not rare proofs of his
<pb n="xvi"/>
esteem for real goodness.<ref n="1"/> During this period appeared  his masterpieceshis principal theological, philosophical,  and ethical Dialogues—when that consummate skill in the  management of the marvellous Attic dialect had been  attained which rivals the style of the best masters, and  which, as the acquisition of a foreigner, excites the admiration of all his editors and critics. Perhaps the only other  equally remarkable instance of such kind of excellence is  that of the African Terence.</p>
<p>When about the age of seventy, impelled, it would seem,  by imminent poverty-for authors, then, even of the highest  reputation fell very far short of obtaining from the Sosii  of the day the immense pecuniary profits now often secured  by ephemeral writers—Lucian once more resumed his old  occupation of rhetor or sophist, and produced some of those  declamatory essays which appear among his published  works. At a fortunate moment, he found relief from his  pecuniary difficulties in an official income derived from his  appointment to the registrarship or clerkship of the law-courts of the Egyptian capital, the presentation to which  office has variously been assigned to Marcus Aurelius,  Commodus, and Severus. Chronology seems, on the whole,  to support the claims of the last prince, who became emperor in 193, to the honour of saving from destitution the  greatest literary ornament of the century. To clear himself from the charge of teaching one thing (in his satire, On  Hired Dependants) and practising another, by way of supplement to that essay he published his Apology. From it,  incidentally, we learn that he derived a large salary (<foreign xml:lang="grc">πολυτά­λαντος</foreign>) from his legal post. He alleges the forcible argument that, as the Imperial master of the Roman legions  himself-not to mention numerous less exalted personages  -by no means refused the richest emoluments of office,

<note type="footnote" n="1"><p>The most interesting, and most meritorious, fact recorded in the life
of this highly interesting philosopher, who inclined in opinion chiefly to  the School of Plato, in practice to that of Antisthenes, is his fine remonstrance addressed to the people of Athens, who were contemplating the  introduction of the cruel " sports" of the Roman amphitheatres.  “ Refrain, Athenians," he protested, " from voting this, until you have  first pulled down your altar erected to Pity " (Dem. 51). See, too, his  very rational remark on sacrifices (Dem. 6). </p></note>

he, the starving critic, could scarcely be blamed for following-in a very humble fashion, and at a very long interval—that elevated example For the most part, his official  duties at Alexandria he devolved upon a deputy, so that  his learned leisure was little disturbed at Athens, where,  as already stated, he died at an advanced age, but at what  date is quite uncertain.</p>
<p>Such are the somewhat meagre facts collected from his  writings. To these his earlier biographers or critics, led  by the lexicographer Suidas, have been pleased to make  some sensational and apocryphal additions. Suidas, of  whom nothing is known except that he belongs to a  very late date in Byzantine literary history, having, probably, in mind the story of the tragic end of the infidel  Euripides, assures his readers that the " blasphemer"  found a well-merited end in having been torn to pieces by  wild dogs ; and, not content with so unique a termination  to his earthly career, adds, as to his posthumous existence,  " in the future, with Satan, he will have his portion in  eternal fire." Another equally discreet authority, of the  sixteenth century, Raffaelle Maffei (or Volaterranus, as he  is called from his birthplace), avers that he was a malicious apostate from Christianity, attributing to him the  bon mot, that he had gained nothing from his old creed but  change of name—Lucianus in place of Lucius (or Lykinus).  To these and similar mendacious assertions Erasmus replies, " they attached to him the name of blasphemer, that  is, 'evil-speaker;' but they who did so, one may be sure,  were those whose festering sores he had probed." To his  bitter and persistent satirical assaults upon the established  religion, and upon the contending sects of (so-called) “ philosophy,” we may be sure, not a few (ephemeral) replies  appeared : but no notices of them have come down to  us. While, however, the last echoes of pagan sacerdotal  or sectarian animosity, excited by his exposures, died away  at the establishment of Christianity, orthodox zeal, on the  other side, even still sometimes regards him as the declared  enemy of the Christian faith. The hostility of the earlier  Christian authorities had been aroused, in particular, by  two very famous Dialogues—the Peregrinus and the Philopatris (" The Patriot”). As for the latter, it has been proved,
<pb n="xviii"/>
beyond reasonable doubt, to have been the production of  a much later writer, bearing the same name as the reputed  author; while, as for the former, the chief offence originated in a mistaken reading or interpretation of the text,  where allusion is made to the Founder of Christianity.<ref n="1"/>  In fact, the brief allusions of the Greek satirist to the new  faith seem to discover less hostility than is displayed in  his ridicule of the rival Oriental creeds, of the established  religion itself, or of the popular systems of philosophy and  ethics.</p>
<p>If Lucian has been thus vilified by the ignorance or  malice of critics of early days, on the other hand, from the  first moment of his resurrection, at the restoration of  learning-from the first appearance of the editio princess,  in 1496—he received an enthusiastic recognition of his  rare merits from the best scholars of the time. Among  them towers conspicuously the illustrious Erasmus, one of  the earliest translators (1514), in conjunction with Sir  Thomas More, of the great master of Ridicule, whom he  himself so admirably imitates in his Encomium Moriae

<note type="footnote" n="1"><p>. According to the text of Hemsterhuis and Lehmann, the especially
significant and highly interesting passage in question-by many critics  believed to have been purposely mutilated-reads as follows :—“ At  which time, he [Peregrinus] made himself thoroughly master of the  wonderful philosophy of the Christians, associating, in Palestine, with  their priests and scribes. And-for what need of details -in a short  time he brought them to be all mere children in his hands, aspiring to  the character of prophet, to be president of their public services, and COIlvener of their Assemblies (<foreign xml:lang="grc">θιασάρχης καὶ ξυναγωγεὺς</foreign>), and he was, in fact,  all in all to them. Of their books some he interpreted and expounded,  many of them even he himself wrote ; and they regarded him in the  light of some divine being, set him up as their legislator, and chose  and publicly acknowledged him as their special patron [here occurs the  suspected hiatus. They, in fact, worship that great man who was  crucified in Palestine, because of his introducing into the world this new  religious mystery (<foreign xml:lang="grc">τελετην</foreign>).”— On the Death of Peregrinus, 11. For
<foreign xml:lang="grc">μέγαν</foreign> his earlier Christian critics seem to have read <foreign xml:lang="grc">μάγον</foreign> ("magician"),
a reading which is approved by Gesner; while to the epithet " wonderful" has been assigned an ironical meaning. Of Peregrinus a more  favourable account is given by Gellius (no very high authority), and  Ammianus Marcellinus (a late writer), as well as by the Christian  writers Athenagoras and Tertullian. The Philopatris (in which satirical  allusion is made to the visions of St. Paul) is assigned to the year 363, the  date of the Emperor Julian's Persian expedition. Cf. Philopseudes. 16. </p></note>

(“Praise of Folly"), and, not altogether so happily, in his  Colloquies. Citing the well-known verse of the Latin satiristpoet,  Omne tulit punctum qui miscuit utile dulci,  he protests :—" no one, if not Lucian, has succeeded in illustrating this truth. He has imitated the raillery, without  copying the wantonness, of the Old Comedy. Gracious  heaven ! [deum immortalem is his strong expletive of admiration], with what sly humour, with what grace and elegance,  he touches everything ! With what power of sarcasm he  holds up every folly to ridicule, how he seasons everything  with his wonderful wit—touching no absurdity that he does  not cover with some irony or satire ! Such grace," continues Erasmus, echoing the dictum of Archbishop Photius,  " dominates in his style, there is so much felicity of invention, so much elegance in his wit, such pungency in his more  serious assaults; he so tickles with his allusions, so mingles  the grave with the gay, in such a way does he enunciate  truth with a smile, so admirably does he picture the  manners, the characters, the pursuits of men, as it were,  with a painter's pencil; in such a manner does he display  things which we can not only read but actually see, that  whether one regards entertainment, or utility and instruction, there is no comedy, no satire, that has a right to be  put in competition with his Dialogues." At the beginning  of the sixteenth century, at least, this high eulogy was  scarcely an exaggeration.</p>
<p>Among the Dialogues translated (into Latin) by Erasmus,  it is interesting to note, are the Timon and the Alexander;  by More (who, as an ecclesiastical zealot, and as Lord Chancellor, so soon forgot the spirit of his author, and the  principles of his own Utopia), the Menippus, the Philopseudes (" The Lover of Lies "), and the Tyrannicide. Even  Melancthon, the associate of Luther in the Reformation  struggle in Germany, assisted in the work of annotating the  great sceptic (1527). Rabelais, although there is no evidence that he took part in illustrating so congenial a mind,  must have been greatly indebted to him. Early in the next  century (1615) his most considerable French editor, Bourdelot, enthusiastically maintains that, " in proportion as the
<pb n="xx"/>
influence of Lucian's writings was diffused, the love of  knowledge and virtue increased, which still resides in the  hearts of a few ;” and goes so far as to affirm that by such  influence the culture, and even civilization, of the philosopher s native country perceptibly benefited in the succeeding  age. A Dutch critic, Hoogstraaten, believes him to have  been not only the greatest genius of his own age, but even  of all antiquity. These high eulogiums, for the most part,  have been repeated by later critics to the days of Hemsterhuis and Reitz (whose judicious settlement of the text, and  criticism and summary of the labours of preceding editors  and annotators, respectively, first made to the world a  worthy presentation of his genuine and attributed productions), and by competent judges of our own time. The  English historian of Greek Literature, J. W. Donaldson,  holds that “his merits can scarcely be over-estimated,"  and considering him with reference to his own age, and  to the Literature of Greece," justly adds the learned historian, “a position of the utmost importance must be  assigned to him, both in regard to the systems of religion  and of philosophy to which he gave the death-blow, and  in respect to the cultivation of a purer style which  he vainly taught and exemplified.” During the sixteenth  century sixty-five editions (in Greek or Latin), in the  seventeenth twenty-two, in the eighteenth forty-four (besides translations), bore ample witness to the estimation  in which he was held by the learned world. In England  the first edition of him (and that only in part) did not  appear till 1677. The first version (in part) in 1634. No  English translation of any pretension appeared till that  of Carr (1775-1798), a spirited, but extremely free, presentation of him, which was followed by that of Franklin  Professor of Greek at Cambridge (1780), and of Tooke (1820) Franklin's, although not very faithful or accurate, being altogether the most valuable of the three chief  English presentations of Lucian. Of French translations,  lalbot s sions, (1857) has the greatest repute. Of German verthat of Wieland, the well-known poet and romancist (1788), is easily first; and, indeed, it is generally held to  be entitled to the foremost place among all attempts at a  modern representation of the Greek wit.</p>
<pb n="xxi"/>
<p>Lucian is almost encyclopaedic in the extent and rarity  of his productions — critic, moralist, philosopher, politician, poet, romancist, litterateur. Of the eighty-four  separate writings attributed to him, and published in the  editions of his works, not a few find an undeserved place  there. Some pieces of inferior merit are the production of  his earlier rhetorical period, and show sufficiently evident  traces of the stilted style characteristic of the fashionable  declamatory essay, as well in matter as in manner. Of his  undoubted productions, the shorter pieces—Dialogues of  the Gods, of the Sea-Gods, and of the Dead—by reason of  their popular subject-matter and peculiar graces of style,  have always been most generally read. His more considerable masterpieces are Zeus the Tragedian, the Sale  of Lives, the Timon, the Ferry Boat, the Twice Accused, the  Fisherman, the Fugitives, the Banquet, the Convicted Zeus,  the Convention of the Gods, the Charon, the Icaro-Menippus,  the True History, the Prometheus, the Philopseudes, How  History Ought to be Written (the first attempt at a philosophy of history, but not of sustained merit throughout),  the Peregrinus, On Sacrifices, On Mourning, and the Alexander. In the Greek Anthology twenty Epigrams are ascribed  to a writer bearing the name of Lucian. Whether the  composition of the Lucian or not, they are by no means  unworthy of his genius,<ref n="1"/> and they are among the best in  the whole extensive Collection.</p>
<p>It is his theological Dialogues that have most contributed

ster Selection); XXXVIII., LX., LXII., LXIII. (Eton Selection); XXXII.,  XL., CCLXIII. (Edwards's Selection), Bohn's English edition, 1854.  E. g.:—“ The wealth of the soul is the only true wealth " (xx., Ed. S.).  " Let a seal on words not to be spoken lie on the tongue. A careful  watch over words is better than one over wealth " (XL .,Ed. S.). "Address  to the Gout:”—“O Goddess! who hatest the Poor, and art the sole  subduer of wealth, who knowest how to live ‘ well' at all times, thou  delightest to be supported on strange feet, and knowest how to wear  shoes of felt, and ointments are a care to thee. Thee, too, garlands  delight, and the liquor of the Ausonian Bacchus. But these things  never exist, at any time, for the Poor. And, therefore, thou fliest from  the threshold of Poverty, that has no gold, and art delighted, on the  other hand, in coming to the feet of Wealth" (XXXII., Ed. S.). This.  rich subject for satire inspired the burlesque drama of Lucian, entitled  Tragopodagra (" Gout in Tragedy "). </p></note>

to his fame. The inimitable Hellenic arts of architecture  and of sculputre which adorned, disguised, and, in some  measure, served to redeem the character of the religion of  Zeus, or Jupiter, had long shown symptoms of decay, the  outward and visible sign of a corresponding coolness in the  " religious ” feeling of the upper classes ; but the religion  of Homer and Hesiod still kept fast hold of the affections  of the body of the peoples (as it continued to do, in fact,  throughout the country districts, longafter the State  recognition of Christianity), while the great majority of  the educated or influential sections of society regarded it  as a useful means of retaining the masses in subjection.<ref n="1"/>  To undermine this imposing structure of mingled fraud  and imposture, the absurdities, the follies, and the hypocrisies of its various adherents, Lucian especially devoted  his almost unrivalled powers of wit and sarcasm ; and, if  ridicule could inflict a mortal wound, he might have been  well satisfied with his brilliant efforts. But reflection on  the history of the Past must sometimes have inspired him  with some misgiving, or even despair. For he was far  from having been the first to expose the character of the  orthodox Theology. In the drama, the most popular form  of literature in Hellas—in Tragedy, Euripides (of the school  of Sokrates) had, in the latter half of the fourth century,  given expression to the more rational belief of the besteducated minds of the time; in Comedy, the conservative  Aristophanes, in his inimitable dramas, whether purposely  or not, had held up to the most open and undisguised  contempt the most sacred objects of the national and  popular worship. In the two next centuries Scepticism  was rampant. In the lighter forms of literature, the Mimes (" parodies ") of Sophron of Syrakuse, and the bitter  satires (silloi, as they were termed) of Timon of Phlius, a  disciple of Pyrrho, whose name has given a synonym for  the extremest scepticism, held up to derision the occupants  of the national Pantheon. Such rationalistic writers, too,  as Euhemerus, author of the Sacred Inscriptions; Palaephatus, author of the Incredible Legends; and, in particular, Menippus, were direct predecessors of the satirist of

<note type="footnote" n="1"><p>For instances of this doctrine of Expediency, see the remarkably
candid admissions of Polybius and of Strabo. </p></note>
<pb n="xxiii"/>
Samosata. But these more popular writers were not the  only assailants of the Pagan Pantheon : and it is enough  merely to mention the names of Anaxagoras, Xenophanes,  Demokritus, Zeno (the founder of the Stoic School),  Antisthenes (the founder of the most practical satirists,  the Cynics), and, above all, Epikurus, to recall their wide  divergences from, and sometimes direct assaults on,  the Olympian theology. -To Lucian, however, as to Voltaire, in the last century, was reserved, in very special  degree, the work of popularizing and bringing within the  reach of the most ordinary intelligence the various labours  of his predecessors. Of his models in the Dialogue form of  writing, Plato and Xenophon are most commonly quoted:  but the eloquent founder of the Academy, and the author  of the Œconomicus, rather improved than originated it.  Sophron of Syracuse, and Zeno of Elea in Italy, had already  brought it into use. In the following century, Antisthenes  also employed it.</p>
<p>As for the ethical character of Lucian, if we may trust  to his own representation of himself, it deserves high  praise. In the Dream, among the superior advantages  offered by Paideia, he gives prominent place to the virtues  of justice, mildness, and reasonableness. In his Revived  Philosophers, he declares himself to be a hater of falsehood,  of imposture, of arrogance, of pride, a lover of truth, of  beauty, of sincerity, and all things lovely (<foreign xml:lang="grc">ὅσα τῷ φιλει̃σθαι  συγγενη̃</foreign>). He abandoned the profession of the Law from  disgust for its iniquity, or for the fraudulent methods of  its practisers. He engages, as he declares, in the war against  Falsehood quite conscious that he is fighting a desperate  battle-that the vast majority are against him (Fisherman, 20). In his biography of his friend, Demonax, his  appreciation of that superior Cynic exhibits him as a  sympathetic admirer of true worth. In one department of  Morals—on the assumption of his having been the author  of the scandalous Erotes (“Loves”)—he has been made the  subject of undeserved censure; for its tedious dulness and  its frigid and sophisticated tone, alike foreign to Lucian's  manner, prove it to be spurious.</p>
<p>It has been sometimes objected to Lucian's philosophical  claims, that he made no attempt to build anew upon the ruins
<pb n="xxiv"/>
of the religious system overthrown by him. But, in the first  place, systems of "faith," or “morals,” already abounded  ad nauseam, and to have erected another system of " philosophy " would have been only to add to the existing confusion. The work immediately and urgently needed was  that of complete destruction, and the clearing of the ground  for the future dissemination of higher and no bIer ideas.  This he did-at all events, as far as religionism and metaphysical shams were concerned-with the persistent zeal  of a sincere reformer. In the second place, if the charge  be a substantial one, he shares the blame with almost every  destructive critic of after ages, whose opportunities for  establishing better faiths have been superior to his. The  charge to which he is more justly open-and it is the  only grave fault, perhaps, in his writings-is indiscrimination in his assaults on the philosophies of the day. His,  apparently, contemptuous treatment, in particular, of Pythagoreanism, the parent of Platonism, and the philosophical  school which was most productive of examples of the  higher virtues as well as of intellectual ability, deserves  censure. In his Sale of Lives, in the Revived Philosophers,  and in one of the Dialogues of the Dead in particular, he  seems to have yielded to the temptation-a sort of temptation to which great wits have always been liable-of utilizing  matter so promising as the ridiculous fables which the enemies of Pythagoreanism abundantly supplied.<ref n="1"/> That among  the (self-styled) followers of Pythagoras were to be found  some pretenders, and not a few extravagant expositors of  his teaching-as such are found in all societies or sects—  is sufficiently probable; but to hold up indiscriminately to  ridicule what was, in the main, a meritorious system of (ethical) philosophy-that, certainly, did not become the  character of a just critic. He lived, indeed, before the  appearance of the School of New or Newer Platonism,

<note type="footnote" n="1"><p>In the Sale or Auction of Lives, Pythagoras, who responds to the

whose founders, Plotinus, Ammonins, and Porphyry (the  most erudite of all the later Greek scholars), belong to the  following century. Extravagant as may have been some of  their speculations, the New-Platonists, by their noble, if  hopelessly futile, attempts to reform and spiritualize the  established religion, and by their noble protests against the  gross practical Materialism of life, have deserved (equally  with the early Christians), among the various contending  sects of religion or philosophy, very high esteem. Had he  witnessed their self-denying lives, and been acquainted with  their exalted ideas and aspirations, we may with some confidence believe that he would have done justice to their  real merits, as distinguished from the errors of judgment  which lay on the surface, and which were the inevitable  outcome of the scientific defects of the age.</p>
<p>The present volume includes what may be termed the  principal theological Dialogues. In the spelling of Greek  names, in the transitional and unsettled state of Greek  orthography in this country, any attempt to adopt a more  natural method must, necessarily, be a compromise : hence  the present version is open to the charge of some orthographical inconsistency. As for the translation itself, the  method adopted has been to adhere as closely to the original as essential differences of idiom allow : to represent  Lucian's peculiar graces of style no translator can reasonably aspire. The versions, entire or partial, which have  appeared up to this time, however spirited they may be—­  and the German Wieland surpasses all his rivals in this  respect, in whose hands, as Lehmann expresses it, “all  Lucian lives and breathes "for the most part are not  distinguished by any very strict fidelity to their original.  The text followed is that of the great work of Hemsterhuis  and Reitz (in Lehmann's edition), which has been compared with the alternative readings adopted by Jacobitz.</p>

<note type="footnote" n="1"><p>For this, one of the most famous of the metamorphoses of the Greek
Theology, see Ovid, Metam. i. 13-17. Io appears as one of the dramatis  personae of the <foreign xml:lang="grc">Προμήθευς Δεσμώτης</foreign> of Aeschylus, where she is represented  as brought in her wanderings to the Caucasian Valley, in which Prometheus was impaled, and bewails the <hi rend="italic"><foreign xml:lang="grc">διαφθορὰν μορφη̃ς</foreign></hi>, as she terms  it. Cf. the <foreign xml:lang="grc">Ἱκέτιδες</foreign> of the same dramatist. Strabo, Diodorus, Apollodorus, and Pausanias add particulars to the Ovidian story. Evidently  the Greeks derived the myth, in the first instance, from the Egyptian  priests. </p></note>

<note type="footnote" n="2"><p>Votive tablets and pictures, suspended in the temples of Isis,
recorded the gratitude of rescued passengers and sailors to their protectress. Pictorcs quis nescit ab Iside pasci? demands Juvenal (xii. 28).  The Egyptian goddess was in especial favour with the Roman ladies, and  her temples were little else than convenient places of assignation.—Juv.  Sat. vi. 489. Pausanias (<foreign xml:lang="grc">Ἑλλάδος Περιήγησις</foreign>, x. 32) describes the ritual  of One of the temples, or shrines, of Isis in Phocis—“ the holiest" of all  her Greek sanctuaries-and records the punishment of certain rash and  inquisitive intruders. “ So," adds Pausanias, " Homer's word seems true  that the Gods are not seen by mortals with impunity.”—See Bohn's  Series. </p></note>

<note type="footnote" n="3"><p>Some authorities represent Zeus as himself, in the shape of his favourite eagle, carrying off his future cup-bearer; while others are
content with the agency of the "royal bird." Ovid (Metam. x. 4) is  among the former. Hesiod knows, or says, nothing of the story of the  rapti Ganymedis honores. According to the Iliad, the rape of the handsome son of the Phrygian king is effected by all the gods in a body.  (xx. 232-5). The scene, usually, is laid on Mt. Ida. Cicero (Tusc.  Quaest. i. 26) will not listen to Homer on this matter. </p></note>

<note type="footnote" n="1"><p>Here, as elsewhere, in his references to the personal appearance of
the members of the Greek Pantheon, Lucian is describing the well-
known characteristics of the famous representations of them in Art. In the present instance, the Zeus of Peindias at Olympia was, doubtless, especially in Lucian's mind, the most famous of the representations of the "Thunderer " as the " Athena Parthenos" and " Athena Promachos " of the same eminent sculptor, on the Acropolis at Athens, and the Cnidian Aphrodite of Praxiteles were of Athena and Aphrodite. </p></note>

especially prevalent in his time, and, probably, had in mind, in particular, the shameful attachment of the late Roman Emperor, Hadrian, for the famous Bithynian youth, Antinous, in whose honour, as is well known,  temples and statues were erected throughout the Empire. Pausanias,  the Greek traveller and antiquary of the second century, a contemporary  of Antinous, informs us that Mantinea, in Arcadia, was especially rich  in statues and paintings of the handsome favourite, whose death is involved in circumstances of so much mystery (viii. 9). </p></note>

<p><label n="Zeus-4">Zeus</label> Not so : but that son of yours, Hephaestus, must  needs act as butler, with his limping gait, coming straight  from his forge, still covered all over with sparks, his fire-tongs only just laid aside : and from those fingers of his I  had to receive the goblet, and drawing him to me to greet  him with a salute between while, whom not even you, his  mother, would kiss with any pleasure, with his face completely blackened with soot.<ref n="1"/> The present arrangement is  much more agreeable : for will you say that it is not so ?  That cup-bearer of yours certainly excellently becomes the  table of the gods; while Ganymede must be sent down  back to Ida—for he is clean, and rosy-fingered, and hands  the goblet deftly; and, what most vexes you, gives kisses  more sweet than nectar.</p>

<p><label n="Hera-5">Hera</label> Yes. Hephaestus is lame now, and his fingers are  not fit to touch your cup, and he is covered with soot, and  the sight of him turns you sick-ever since Ida produced  that handsome youth with the flowing locks. Yet, formerly, you did not observe these things; neither the sparks  nor the forge turned your stomach so as to prevent your  drinking from his hand.</p>

<p><label n="Zeus-5">Zeus</label> You plague yourself to no purpose, Hera, while  you intensify my love for him by your jealousy. Well, if  you are annoyed at receiving the goblet from a beautiful  boy, let your son pour out your wine, and as for you,  Ganymede, hand the cup only to myself, and at each time  kiss me twice: when you offer it full, and again whenever  you take it back from me.—What's this ? In tears ? Don't  be afraid; if any one has any intention of annoying you  he will have cause to lament.

But by  the wiser part of men it is not unknown that he is, for the  most part, a mere juggler in words. The prophet himself,  at all events, did not know he would kill his favourite  with the quoit, nor did he divine for his own advantage,  that Daphne would flee from him ; and that, too, although  he is so handsome and has such flowing locks.

As for the miraculous metamorphosis of Niobe, Pausanias, who had seen the pillar of  stone, considers that there need be no difficulty in believing it, for it  happened in the old times of frequent miraculous interposition of  Heaven. He is not prepared, however, to maintain that such miracles  take place in his own day, for man's impiety precludes the possibility.  Accordingly, he does not credit the received story that the petrified  Niobe sheds tears, or the popular tales about lycanthropy, or that the  Tritons blow through their shells, as the vulgar believe (viii. 2). Cf.  viii. 8.

And, as for your beautiful virgin, she is so beautiful, that,  when she found she had been seen by Actaeon, from fear  the youth might proclaim her ugliness, she set on him his  own dogs.<ref n="2"/> I don't say all I might, for I omit to dwell on  the fact, that, if she were really a virgin,<ref n="3"/> she could not  even assist ladies in the straw.</p>

<p><label n="Leto-3">Leto</label> You bear yourself superciliously, Hera, because  you share the bed and throne of Zeus; and for that reason,  you utter your insults without fear. But, however, I shall  soon see you in tears again, when he deserts you and goes  down to earth again in the form of a bull or a swan.

<p><label n="Hermes-3">Hermes</label> Some lady of Ida<ref n="1"/> appears to be keeping company with him—well enough in her way, but countrified  and dreadfully boorish. However, he does not seem to be  excessively attached to her. But, pray, why do you put  these questions ?</p>

<p><label n="Aphrodite-4">Aphrodite</label> I asked quite indifferently.</p>

<p><label n="Athena-1">Athena</label> Holloa! you Sir, there, you are exceeding your  commission in communicating with her in private.</p>

<p><label n="Hermes-4">Hermes</label> It was nothing extraordinary, Athena, and  nothing against you. She only asked me if Paris is a  bachelor.</p>

<p><label n="Athena-2">Athena</label> And pray, why is she so inquisitive about that ?</p>

<p><label n="Hermes-6">Hermes</label> I think not.</p>

<p><label n="Athena-4">Athena</label> What then ? Has he a desire for the military  life, and is he at all ambitious for glory, or is he altogether  devoted to his herds ?</p>

<p><label n="Hermes-7">Hermes</label> The exact truth I am unable to say: but one  must suppose that a young fellow like him would be eager  to acquire fame in these things, and would like to be first  in fighting.</p>

<p><label n="Hermes-13">Hermes</label> But they are not women, Paris ; but it is Hera,  and Athena, and Aphrodite you see; and I, I am the God  Hermes Zeus has sent with them. But why do you  tremble and turn so pale ? Don't be frightened, for there  is nothing to be afraid of. He only bids you to be the  judge of their beauty: "for since," says he, "you are a  handsome youth yourself, and clever in love-matters, I  entrust the judgment to you ; and when you have read the  inscription on the apple, you will know the prize of the  contest.”</p>

<p><label n="Paris-2">Paris</label> Come, let me see what it all means—“ LET THE  BEAUTIFUL ONE TAKE ME," it says. How, pray, Sir Hermes,  could I, a mere mortal myself, and a simple peasant, too,  be a judge of so preternaturally wonderful a spectacle, and  one too great for a poor herdsman to decide upon ? To  judge in matters of such importance is rather for delicatelynurtured persons and courtiers : but, for my part, whether  one she-goat be more beautiful than another she-goat, or  one heifer surpasses another heifer in beauty I could perhaps decide secundum artem. But these ladies are all  equally beautiful, and I don't know how a man could  wrench away his gaze and transfer it from the one to the  other; for it will not easily unfix itself, but where it first  rests, to that part it clings, and commends what's immediately before it. And even though it pass on to another  part, that too it sees to be beautiful, and lingers, and is  caught by the adjoining charms; and, in short, their  beauty has circumfused itself about me, and wholly taken  possession of me, and I am vexed that I, too, cannot, like  Argus, see with all my body. I think I should judge  fairly, if I give the apple to all: for, indeed, there is this

<note type="footnote" n="2"><p>Menippus, who figures so conspicuously in these Dialogues, was a
countryman of Lucian, born at Gadara, in Hollow Syria, in the first  century B.C. He belonged to the Cynic sect, and by his satirical  writings is one of the most famous of that school: but his cynicism did  not prevent him from making an extensive fortune in trade as a banker,  which he lost by the bad faith of a trusted friend. He then put an end  to his life. His Satires are known to us only through the fragments of  the Suturae Menippeae of Varro (his contemporary), the learned Latin  antiquarian : one of the best of which is the Prometheus Liber. Cicero  (Quaest. Academ.) alludes to the Menippean Satires as displaying profound philosophy as well as wit. Marcus Aurelius (<foreign xml:lang="grc">Τά εἰς'Εαυτὸν</foreign>)  especially mentions him as a distinguished mocker of human life  (<foreign xml:lang="grc">χλευαστής</foreign>). The predecessors of Menippus, in this line, were Demokritus of Abdera (<foreign xml:lang="grc">Τα περ</foreign>ì <foreign xml:lang="grc">τω̃νι</foreign>v '<foreign xml:lang="grc">Αδου̃</foreign>), and one or two other lessknown names. One of the most interesting of the Lucianic Dialogues,  which is a sort of epitome of the Dialogues of the Dead, and w hich  might well have given Dante hints for his Inferno, derives its title from the Cynic of Gadara—<foreign xml:lang="grc">Μενίππος ἢ Νεκυομαντεία</foreign>. <foreign xml:lang="grc">Κύων</foreign>, "the Dog," is
frequently used by Lucian for the adjective <foreign xml:lang="grc">κυνικὸς</foreign>. Cf. <foreign xml:lang="grc">Δἰς Κατηγορουύμενος</foreign>, 33. The Homeric picture of Hades (<foreign xml:lang="grc">Ὀδ</foreign>. xi.) is an especial object  of ridicule throughout these Dialogues. </p></note>

But here you will not cease laughing  on firm grounds, as I do now, and most of all when you  see the rich, and viceroys, and princes to be so humble and  obscure, and distinguishable by their lamentations alone,  and that they are soft-hearted and mean-spirited, recollecting their life above."

As for the syllogism of the " crocodile," it  derived its name from the following illustration :-A crocodile seizes a  child on the banks of a river, and promises to restore it to the father if  he can tell truly whether the child will be given back or no. How  completely the father was placed on the horns of a dilemma needs no  demonstration. The illustration is given by Lucian, in his ridicule of  the Stoic logic in the Sale of Lives. Cf.

Amphilochus, the murderer  of his mother, had shrines at Athens, at Oropus on the confines of  Attica and Boeotia, and at Mallus in Cilicia. The Oracle of Amphiaraus was situated near Thebes, at the spot where he had been  swallowed up with his chariot, in his flight from the battle before that  city. For the still more renowned Oracle and Cavern of Trophonius  (who while in the flesh had enjoyed the reputation of an expert thief)  at Lebadeia in Boeotia, see Aristoph. <foreign xml:lang="grc">Νεφ</foreign>. 507 ; Diod.

of the works of Lucian, and the original of so many other satirical  romances, Alexander and Hannibal are again introduced to its contending for precedence, in their posthumous existence, in the Island of  the Blessed. On this occasion Rhadamanthys, who is the judge, assigns  the first place, also, to the conqueror of Dareius, on a throne by the  side of the founder of the Persian monarchy. Scipio does not figure in  this scene; and it is a curious fact that no Roman is admitted into  Lucian's Elysium. By Livy (xxxv. 14) Hannibal is represented as  much more modest than he appears in this Dialogue; for, in reply  to a question of Scipio, he pronounces Alexander to be the first of  military commanders, Pyrrhus, King of Epeirus, second, and himself  third; although, if he had been so fortunate as to conquer his questioner, as he had the other Roman generals, he would not have hesitated  to give the precedence to himself. Cf. Appian, ‛<foreign xml:lang="grc">Ιστ. Ρωμ</foreign>. xi. In the <foreign xml:lang="grc">Καίσαρες</foreign> of Julian, Alexander is put in comparison with the

But tell me, in the name of your own  Herakles—when he was alive, did you associate with him  at that time as his ghost; or, were you one and the same  during your life, and, when you died, did you separate and  did he fly off to heaven, and you, the ghost, as was natural,  come to Hades ?</p>

<p><label n="Herakles-6">Herakles</label> I ought not even to have replied to a man who  talks thus lightly. However, pray, just hear this, too. As  much as there was of Amphitryon in Herakles,<ref n="1"/> that has  died, and I am all that; but what there was of Zeus is  living with the Gods in heaven.</p>

</div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="4">

<p><label n="Diogenes-7">Diogenes</label> Now I clearly understand. For Alkmene gave  birth, you imply, to two Herakleses at the same time-the  one by Amphitryon, and the other from Zeus; so that, without its being known, you were twins, born of the same  mother.</p>

<p><label n="Herakles-7">Herakles</label> No, vain trifler: why, we both were one and  the same person.</p>

<p><label n="Herakles-8">Herakles</label> What! don't you suppose all men to be so composed of two parts-soul and body ? So what is to hinder  the soul from being in heaven, which was from Zeus, and  the mortal part-myself-from being with the dead ?</p>

<p><label n="Diogenes-9">Diogenes</label> Nay, most excellent son of Amphitryon, you  would have fairly advanced that argument if you were a  body; but now you are a bodiless ghost. So you are  perilously near making Herakles just now into a trinity.</p>

<note type="footnote" n="2"><p>Menippus alludes to the canal across the Macedonian peninsula of
Chalkidike (of which Mount Athos is the Southern extremity) formed  by order of Xerxes, to avoid the dangerous passage round that cape.  The canal, of which traces are visible, had a length of one and a-half  miles. Juvenal, who, in common with many ancient and modern writers,  was incredulous, thus refers to it :—  " Creditur olim  Velificatus Athos, et quidquid Graecia mendax  Audet in bistoria; constructum classibus isdem  Suppositumque rotis solidum mare."  Sat. x. 174-177.  Some one hundred and fifty years later a yet more ambitious, and  much less praiseworthy, work was proposed by an architect in Alexander  of Macedon's train-the transformation of Mount Athos into a gigantic  statue of that conqueror, holding in one hand a city of 10,000 inhabitants, and in the other a river.

<note type="footnote" n="2"><p>As in the case of Pythagoras, Lucian chooses to adopt the absurd
popular legend, or hostile calumny, which represents this distinguished  philosopher as throwing himself into the crater of AEtna, that his miraculous disappearance might acquire for him the honours of divinity.

Diogenes informs us that the Pythagorean philosophers were in the habit  of wearing sandals or slippers of brass; but Lucian's epithet, <foreign xml:lang="grc">χαλκόπου</foreign>,  as Wieland points out, may be derived from <foreign xml:lang="grc">Ἰλ</foreign>. xiii. 23, and from  the "<foreign xml:lang="grc">Ηλεκτρα</foreign> of Sophokles, 492. In spite of alleged eccentricities,  Empedokles has deserved to be regarded as one of the most distinguished  savants and geniuses of old Hellas. The greatest of Latin poets speaks of  him in terms of the highest and most enthusiastic praise. Celebrating  the glories of Sicily, Lucretius adds :—  " Nil tamen hoc habuisse viro praeclarius in se  Nec sanctum magis et mirum carumque vidctur.

One narrative attributes it to the indignation of Athena, whom he had  chanced to see in the bath, who, however, gave him, by way of compensation, the prophetic faculties. His transformation into one of the  opposite sex is attributed to his haying killed a female serpent, and  his double experience induced Zeus to make him arbiter in his dispute  with Hera upon the question, which sex has the greater enjoyment ;  and, when he pronounced in favour of the weaker, the indignant Hera.  deprived him of sight.

<title type="main">ZEUS THE TRAGEDIAN.</title>
</head>

<note><p>[ZEUS, gloomy and in tragic distress, is implored by
Hermes and Athena to divulge the cause of his melancholy condition; while Hera, true to her Homeric character,  confidently attributes it to another earthly amour. The  king of gods and men, thus adjured, announces the true  reason of his anxiety-flaring assaults upon the character  of himself and the rest of the Olympian divinities, and, in  fact, denial of their very existence, by the skeptics, represented by an Epikurean philosopher named Damis ; and the  weakness of the arguments of their over-zealous apologists,  the Stoics, represented by a champion named Timokles:  which all-important controversy he had chanced to overhear when present, on the day preceding, at a sacrificial  feast given to the Gods at Athens.</p>
<p>He proceeds to request the opinions of the three divinities upon the best course to be pursued, in the emergency.  Hera and Hermes propose a Council of the Gods; Athena,  a private settlement of the business. The former opinion  prevails, and Zeus directs Hermes to summon the rest of  the Gods to a general Council, which the Olympian herald  proceeds to do in the orthodox Homeric style, after some  reluctance on account of his want of poetic skill, and in  face of the discouraging example of Apollo, whose prophetic utterances (in verse) had become the object of so  much ridicule. Some difficulty arises, at the outset, on  the question of precedence, both because (the representative  statues of the divinities being variously formed of gold,  silver, ivory, and bronze) it was a question whether it  should be decided by the material, or by the excellence of
<pb n="169"/>
the workmanship; and, also, by reason of the numerous  recent additions to their august body. Zeus rules that  gold must have the preference. By this decision the oldestablished, genuine Hellenic divinities find themselves  forced to give way to the novi homines, not without much  and protracted squabbling. In the end, by the ruling of  the president, the members of the celestial Senate have to  take their places promiscuously, on the principle of " first  come first served."</p>
<p>Silence having been secured, Zeus rises to open the  deliberations. An unaccustomed nervousness and hesitation threaten to spoil his exordium, and even to ruin everything, by raising suspicion of the soundness of their cause.  At length, at the suggestion of Hermes, discarding the  well-worn Homeric exordium, he opens in the words of a  famous oration of Demosthenes. He sets forth the cause  of the summoning of the Council, and reports the circumstances which led to his presence at the dispute between  the Epikurean and Stoic champions, in the Painted Porch  at Athens, and its fortunate interruption at a critical  moment by the pressure of the crowd, with its consequent  adjournment. The Gods, whom age and standing permit,  are then invited to deliver their several opinions upon the  course of action to be adopted. Momus, the Censor of the  Olympian Court, rises, and, with his usual candour, affirms  that the objections and arguments of their avowed enemies  are not at all to be wondered at; and, in fact, himself  points to the prevalence of injustice and cruelty, the  triumph of the bad, and the oppression and sufferings of  the good on the Earth. He takes occasion to ridicule the  studied ambiguity and obscurity of Apollo and his oracular  prophecies, and the mischiefs arising from them ; and next  criticises the policy which admitted so many strange and  outlandish divinities to the rights of Olympian Godship.</p>
<p>Poseidon and Apollo next address the Council; the  former voting for violent and summary measures-nothing  less, in fact, than the destruction of Damis by a thunderbolt;  in which opinion (later) he is vigorously supported by  Herakles. The latter calls attention to the inferiority, and  confused and illogical method, of their apologist, and advises  that an associate-advocate be supplied to him, to whom alone
<pb n="170"/>
it should be allowed to speak, Timokles acting merely as his  prompter. The opportunity is not lost by Momus for sarcastic allusion to Apollo's own confused prophetical style;  and, ridiculing the proposition of an associate-advocate, he  calls upon him opportunely to give some ex tempore specimens of his oracular faculty. Thus urged, with much  reluctance and diffidence Apollo complies, to the great  entertainment of his censor. At this juncture there arrives  in hot haste, fresh from the yesterday's scene of verbal  conflict at the Painted Porch, Hermagoras, a statuary, who,  like the Ephesian town-clerk, may be supposed to have  been a not entirely disinterested well-wisher to the Olympian Establishment. In iambic verse he announces the  approaching renewal of hostilities, in the oracular strain so  dear to Apollo, and so well known to readers of Herodotus,  of the <foreign xml:lang="grc">Ὀρνίθες</foreign> and ’<foreign xml:lang="grc">Ἱππεῖς</foreign> of Aristophanes, and of Lucian.</p>
<p>The Celestials arrange themselves in attitudes of eager expectancy ; and the verbal duel below begins with a vituperative onslaught (in which controversial virtue Zeus recognizes  their champion's strength to lie) on the part of Timokles, and  a dispute on the question upon which of the two rested the  onus probandi. This being settled, at length, by the concession of Damis in favour of his opponent, the combatants  engage in earnest. As the fortune of the day seems to  incline to this side or that, the celestial -spectators express,  chorus-like, their hopes or fears-the latter, however, very  greatly preponderating; Momus not omitting to exercise  his powers of sarcasm. Timokles, after vainly throwing  overboard his sheet-anchor-in the shape of a remarkable  syllogism-takes refuge, as his opponent tauntingly expresses it, at the altars. Damis, claiming the victory, now  retires from the scene, pursued by the vituperation and  even missiles and blows of his enraged antagonist. The  celestial clients of Timokles disperse, consoled by the reflection of Hermes, that, in spite of all the arguments of  the wicked philosophers, at all events the larger part of  the world, Greek as well as barbarian, will continue to be  on their side, and not cease to supply them with the rich  steams of sacrifice. Zeus, however, cannot refrain from  the expression of his feeling, that he would rather have

This beautiful statue survived, at  least, tothe sixth century. Of the works of Euphranor, a native of Korinth,  but, like most of the great artists, resident at the " hospitable " Athens,  most celebrated was his representation of Paris, of which the statue in  the Museo Pio-Clementino is probably a copy.

<p>[Cyniskus, a Cynic philosopher <stage>(as his name imports)</stage>, encouraged by Zeus to ask a favour, protests that his request  will be a very modest one and very easy to grant: he is not

<note type="footnote" n="1"><p><foreign xml:lang="grc">Ζεὺς 'Ελεγχομέονος</foreign>—“ Zeus Convicted," " Confuted," or " Cross-Examined." Of this Dialogue Wieland remarks :—" Never, probably,
had any writing a more appropriate title than this, in which Jupiter,  in a tête-à-tête, is forced by the straightforward and undaunted Cynic,  in a way such as, probably, he had never yet experienced from any son  of Earth, to confess the truth. The worst blow, to which dogmas, that  are not grounded upon Reason, can be submitted, is when one holds up  their mutual contradictions to the light. One spares oneself, by this  means, the trouble of refutation, and can calmly see them, like the  armed men sown by Kadmus, annihilate themselves. This is the spectacle which Lucian gives us, in this Dialogue, in his best manner. </p>

<p>" The inconsistencies of the Pagan doctrines of a Fate, of the 
dence of their Gods, and of the system of Rewards and Punishments  after death, appears in it in a light, by whose brilliance Jupiter himself  is quite dazed and reduced to silence ; or, what is still more humiliating,  to so miserable a shift, that Cyniscus himself, at last, out of mere pity,  and content with having deprived him, after complete overthrow in open  field, of his power, his dignity, and his kingdom, and leading him in  triumph mortally wounded, presents him with his life for so long as in  the course of Nature it might be expected to last. The questions which  he lays before Jupiter had, in fact, been already debated in the Jupiter  in Tragedy, between Damis and Timokles, not to the advantage of the  party of the Gods. But Lucian, as it seems, held it to be necessary to  deliver a last decisive assault. Jupiter had to be driven out altogether  from his last lurking-holes, and to be convicted of his wicked deeds so  completely, that the most shameless sycophant must blush any longer  to undertake his defence. This it is, that Lucian, as it seems to me, in  this little Dialogue, in so masterly a way, and with so much fineness of  touch, manages to effect, that I know no more complete example of the  transformation of the antipodes of reason (as Homer expresses it) ' into  earth and water.'" </p></note>

going to petition for wealth or power, but simply for enlightenment on certain perplexing points of theology and  metaphysics. He begins with a request to be informed as  to the truth of the statements of Homer and Hesiod  respecting the Fates, and their absolute control over human  life. Zeus assures him of their omnipotence. The apparent  contradictions of the Hellenic Scriptures are easily explained by the circumstance that their inspiration had not  been constant: that, when those theologian-poets spoke of  their own free motion, they were, like ordinary mortals,  liable to error ; but everything uttered by them under  direct inspiration of the divinities is entirely to be received.</p>
<p>Cyniskus then inquires whether Zeus himself acknowledges subjection to the Fates, to Chance or Fortune (also  the object of the popular Creed) ; and, upon the assent of  the " King of Gods and men," he proceeds to quote the  well-known passage in the Iliad on the " Golden  Chain,”and, sarcastically, remarks that the Fates themselves  more justly might boast of suspending him in mid-air.  Becoming more and more uneasy at every new question,  Zeus professes himself to be at a loss to divine at what his  interlocutor is driving. Nor is his alarm without some  reason, since the Cynic next inquires the purpose of the  hecatombs of slaughtered victims for the altars, and of all  the costly sacrifices ? Instead of direct reply, Zeus takes  occasion to denounce the philosophers and sophists, and their  well-known impiety. Pressed on the question of utility,  he defends the sacrificial system upon the pretext of its  being an outward and visible sign of respect and honour  on the part of men for what is greater and nobler than  themselves. To which the Cynic retorts that one of these  wicked philosophers might be disposed to ask in what consists the superiority of the Gods, seeing that they are subject and subordinate to Fate : for the accident of " immortality," so far from being an advantage, retains them in  everlasting servitude. Nor, if the Hellenic theology was  to be believed, could it be said that all divinities are in  enjoyment of so much happiness-a positiorrwhich Cyniskus  illustrates by some conspicuous examples. Zeus now resorts  to indirect menaces, and angrily hints at some supernatural  punishment of the audacious sceptic: but the 
<pb n="211"/>
sopher calmly expresses his confidence that he can suffer  nothing which has not been, by the Fates or Destiny, foreordained. Besides, he observes that not even the most  audacious insulters of the Gods themselves-the many  plunderers of their temples-seem to be any the worse off  for their sacrilege, while the innocent frequently fall victims  to the indiscriminating thunderbolts.</p>
<p>Driven to bay, the champion of the orthodox Olympian  theology reprobates the philosopher as one of those who  are for destroying all idea of a divine providence ; Cyniskus  inquires who or what is Providence, and how exercised, and  is told that he is becoming grossly impertinent; but he  extracts the reluctant admission that the Gods, after all,  are nothing but the agents and ministers of Destiny. Zeus,  however, attempts to rescue himself and his colleagues from  the consequent position of utter superfluousness and contempt by claiming credit for oracles and prophecies. The  Cynic retorts, of whafuse are warnings against the inevitable  -to say nothing of the ambiguous and misleading character of these divine oracles. Zeus makes some feeble  attempt at an apology, and then, not obscurely, threatens  the dernier ressort of the most forcible of his arguments-the  thunderbolt. Cyniskus tauntingly remarks that what is  fated is fated-and he is quite prepared to receive the inevitable. He wishes to know how it happens that such  men as Aristeides, Sokrates, Phokion, suffered, while the  tyrants of the world, for the most part, have been allowed  to flourish. That is easily answered, rejoins the king  of Gods, for are not men to receive their deserts in a future  life ? His unrelenting tormentor retorts once more that,  for his part, he would rather escape certain misery and  suffering in this life than have the offer of not altogether  certain happiness in another state of existence. But, continues the Cynic, if Fate or Predestination, ordain and  control everything, how, in fine, can there be any logical  place for a Minos to distribute rewards and punishments ?  Zeus disdains to answer so captious a question, and  stigmatizing his satirical examiner as impudent and sophistical, abruptly leaves him. As a parting shot, the  Cynic bawling after him desires to learn, particularly,  where, after all, these Fates are to be found-or how they
<pb n="212"/>
manage to transact so enormous an amount of business, with  their extremely limited number, and ventures to think that  they themselves must have been born under a not too  propitious destiny. As for himself, he professes himself  quite satisfied with the information he has extracted from  the highest authority, and contents himself with the reflection, that, as for the points upon which he had failed to  receive information, it was, apparently, not in " the fateS ”  that he should be enlightened.]</p>

popular Theology, which makes the Gods dependent on Fate (Schicksal),  or Necessity (Nothwendigkeit), and, also, even upon the Pares, who  execute the laws of Necessity. As, however, nothing was firm or stereotyped in the Greek Theology, the common belief did not hinder many,  to whom the consequences of such teaching were a stumbling-block, from  thinking otherwise. Pausanias, where he speaks of the statues of Jupiter  Olympius at Megara, gives as the reason why the Horae and Parcae are  represented hovering above the God's head, that it was pretty generally  recognized that Pepromene (‘Fate’), is subject to Jupiter alone, and  that the Horcae are ruled by him, and kept in due order. But Lucian's  Jupiter, weak as he was, had, at least, so much understanding as to  know that a Necessity, subject to his absolute will, could be no Necessity;  and is, accordingly, resolved not to overstrain his power, either in regard  of the Parcae that hover over his head at Megara, or of the statues and  altars, which, according to the testimony of Pausanias, he possessed  here and there under the name of Moiragetes (' Ruler of the Fates'):  but, rather, with a good grace confessed that not only could he not alter  the laws of Fate, but that he was, as regards his own person, subject to  them. Lucian could with so much the greater justice make his Jupiter  confess this, because the Delphic Apollo himself, when Kroesus bitterly  reproached him after the unlucky event of his war with Cyrus, excused  himself in the same way (Herod. i. 91).”—Wieland. </p></note>

<p><label n="Zeus-17">Zeus</label> I told you already before that it is not lawful or  proper for you to know everything.

<p><label n="Cyniskus-18">Cyniskus</label> That is not my affair : but you affirmed, a little  before, that they are the Fates that accomplish everything;  unless, perchance, you repent of making those concessions,

</div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="11">

<p><label n="Zeus-18">Zeus</label> By no means ; on the contrary, it is Fate that  brings each thing to pass through our agency.</p>

<p><label n="Cyniskus-19">Cyniskus</label> I understand. You say you are a kind of  agents and ministers of the Fates. But, however, even so,  it would be they who exercise providence, while you are,  as it were, a sort of tools and instruments of theirs.</p>

<p><label n="Zeus-19">Zeus</label> How ?</p>

<p><label n="Cyniskus-20">Cyniskus</label> How ? Why, just as, I suppose, the carpenter's  axe and auger work together, in some sort, for the creation of the work: but no one would say that they are the  workman himself, nor the ship the work of the axe or the  auger, but of the shipwright. Analogously, then, Destiny  is she who acts as the shipwright in regard to each particular, while you are, I presume, the axes and augers of  the Fates : and, as it seems, men ought to offer their sacrifices to Destiny, and demand their good things from her;  whereas they approach you, honouring you with their  processions and sacrifices. And yet they would not do it  reasonably, even in honour of Destiny. For I don't  suppose it to be possible even for the Fates themselves to  change or upset anything of what has been originally decreed respecting each several event. At all events, Atropos<ref n="1"/>  would not tolerate it, if anyone were to turn back the  spindle, and undo the work of Klotho.</p>

</div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="12">

<p><label n="Zeus-20">Zeus</label> And do you, Cyniskus, now require that not even  the Fates be held in honour by men? Well, you seem to  have for your object to throw everything into confusion.  We, however, if for nothing else, should be justly honoured,  at least, for our giving out oracles and predicting every  particular thing which has been determined by the Fates.</p>

<p><label n="Cyniskus-21">Cyniskus</label> Upon a survey of the whole matter, it is useless, Zeus, for those to whom it is altogether impossible to  guard themselves against them, to foreknow events that are  to take place; unless you say this-that one who has  learned beforehand that he will have to die by an iron  spear-head, might be able to escape death by shutting himself up. But that is impossible : for Fate will drag him

The saying of Laius is, indeed, ridiculous, which says :­
<quote><l>" Sow not, in heav'n's despite, a field of sons :</l>
<l>Sure death you'll meet from your own progeny.<ref n="1"/> </l></quote>
For an exhortatory warning against events that will certainly so happen is, I imagine, superfluous. So, in fact,  after the oracle, he did "sow," and the progeny" slew  him. Therefore, I don't see upon what pretence you demand  pay for your oracular art. </p>

</head>
<p>[Zeus, to hush the loud murmurs and growing discontent  of the privileged classes of Olympus at the constant influx  of novi divi, which threatens altogether to swamp the  ancient orders of divinity, summons a General Assembly  for the purpose of taking measures to remedy the evil.  After proclamation by Hermes, by permission of the President, Momus, the Censor, or Public Prosecutor, of  Olympus, again undertakes the not uncongenial task of  exposing the patent scandals flourishing in their midst.  He repeats his old complaints,<ref n="2"/> and animadverts sarcastically  upon the scandal, that not only are mortal men deified, but  that they bring with them a whole train of disreputable  followers of low or hybrid origin, whom, surreptitiously,  they introduce into the haut monde, and, by corrupt arts,  contrive to get raised to the Olympian peerage; that these  dieux nouveaux insist upon an equal share, with the ancient  aristocracy, of the public feasts and sacrifices. Here the  President interposes, and calls upon the Public Prosecutor  to proceed from general to particular charges, and specify  names. Thus admonished, Momus particularizes the most  conspicuous scandals of this kind, and proceeds (in spite

Inasmuch as, however, on this memorable  occasion, the “ upper " and " lower " Houses (the Boulé and Ecclesia)  sat and voted together, the French National Assembly”or "Convention " more exactly represents the character of the present meeting of  the divinities.

of a caution from Zeus to except certain privileged personages from his indictment) to insinuate that the case of  the “ king of Gods and men " himself is not unobnoxious  to severe criticism-in particular, in regard to certain  events in the island of Krete, the scene of his education  and <stage>(alleged)</stage> decease ; and his notorious amours with  certain terrestrial mistresses, which were at once hazardous  and ridiculous. He does not omit to descant upon a  number of other notorious scandals caused by the too free  conduct of other deities of either sex, in imitation of their  father and sovereign lord. At the urgent interposition  of Zeus, passing over the Ganymede scandal, he next  attacks the Oriental, and especially Egyptian, interlopers ;  and, again called to order, passes on to the various oracular  divinities, and their portentously-increasing number-instancing certain well-known athletes, who had received  the honours of divinity and immortality. One of the  results of this extension of the celestial franchise, according to the Censor, is the increase of perjury. Descending  rapidly to human concerns, he severely assails the newfangled names bandied about in the logomachies, and  word-twisting of the " philosophers;" and has a fling at  the new fashion of deifying Nature and Destiny, &amp;c., which  threatens to divert the old-accustomed rich sacrifices from  Heaven to Earth. At this point of his oration, observing  signs of weariness from some, of hostility from others,  Momus brings his address to a somewhat abrupt close.  Leave having been given by the President, he then reads  the resolution.</p>
<p>The Decree sets forth, in the approved <stage>(Attic)</stage> legal  forms, the principal cause of the convocation of the  Assembly—viz., the intrusion of spurious and barbarous  interlopers, the overcrowding of Heaven, and the consequent alarming and extraordinary rise in the marketprices of their ambrosia and nectar, and the arrogance  and presumption of the dieux nouveaux. It announces the  meeting of the celestial Chambers in the approaching  winter, when an Inquisitorial Commission is to be appointed for thorough revision and strict scrutiny of the  claims of the several more recent and surreptitious additions  to the theocracy; when they will be expected to produce
<pb n="227"/>
credentials, and proofs of the soundness of their claims :  the penalty of the flames of Tartarus to be enacted for all  who disobey the ruling of the Commission. Also, it is to  be within the powers of the same Commission to ascertain and curtail the present pluralities and patronage of  the various members of the ancien regime.</p>

</head>
<p>[Charon, ready to set sail, awaits impatiently the appearance of Hermes, who is behind time with his accustomed batch of ghosts; and gives vent to his vexation in  complaints to Klotho, his colleague. Presently, the Conductor of the Dead is seen approaching, heated and out of  breath, driving the ghosts before him. He accounts for  his delay by narrating the attempt to escape of one of his  convoy, the tyrant Megapenthes, and the difficulty of the  re-capture, which was effected only by the timely assistance  of the cynic Kyniskus <stage>(a fellow-ghost)</stage> ; and the fugitive  tyrant now appears on the scene securely fettered.</p>
<p>Before setting sail for Hades, Klotho receives from  Hermes, and enters on his way-bill, the names, nationality,  and manner of death of the various passengers. The cynic  philosopher complains that she has unfairly neglected him ;  and declares that he had long been intending to anticipate  her decree. In contrast to the disciple of Antisthenes,  the tyrant begs long and vehemently for respite, however  brief, on various pretences, all of which are sternly rejected,  by the Fate. In the end, he is forcibly carried on board  by Hermes and Charon, aided by the Cynic, and bound to  the mast. At this stage, the cobbler, Mikyllus, comes  forward to expostulate with Klotho yet more strongly at  her long neglect of him, and, to her expressions of astonishment at his eagerness to embark, he replies by narrating,

<note type="footnote" n="1"><p><foreign xml:lang="grc">Κατάπλους ἢ Τυράννος</foreign>. Strictly, " The Putting-in, or Arrival of the

at considerable length, his reasons for not shunning Charon's boat; and, at the same time, confesses his previous  illusions in regard to the imagined happiness of the despot,  Megapenthes.</p>
<p>Klotho now gives orders for weighing anchor; when the  cobbler, finding that he was to be left behind until the  next day, owing to the crowded state of the boat, struggles  hard to get on board, and, failing in the attempt, jumps  into the Styx, to get across by swimming. He is, then,  perforce, taken into the boat-a place being found for him  on the shoulders of the tyrant-which proceeds on its  voyage: while Kyniskus, like the cobbler afterwards on  landing, declares his inability to pay the small coin required  as the fare, and earns his passage by taking an oar.</p>
<p>The tedium of the rest of the voyage he relieves by  giving the " time " to his fellow-rowers, to the tune of some  popular sea-song, and in jeering at the lamentations of the  rich passengers, in which amusement he is joined by the  cobbler. Upon landing, the cynic and cobbler join company, and proceed arm in arm towards the tribunal of  Rhadamanthys. The Infernal Judge orders that the  various dead men be brought before him. The cynic at  once demands to be heard against the tyrant; and, after  previous satisfactory examination of himself, which results  in his receiving a passport for the Elysian Fields, he charges  Megapenthes with his foul deeds of cruelty and of debauchery.  That royal criminal is found to be covered with the stigmata  -the brand-mark, of his crimes and vices; and, to establish the accusations of his principal accuser, the tyrant's  own lamp and bed are brought forward as witnesses. At  the suggestion of his accuser, Megapenthes, in place of  being consigned to the flames of Pyriphlegethon, is prohibited from drinking of the waters of Lethe; and his  punishment in Tartarus consists in an ever-present recollection of his evil deeds. In accordance with the terms of  his sentence, he is now dragged away by the Erinyes, and  chained by the side of another royal criminal, Tantalus;  who, as a comparatively innocent offender, had some reason  to complain of this unexpected addition to his torture.]</p>

<p><label n="Charon-1">Charon</label> <stage>(fretfully)</stage> Well, Klotho, this little craft of ours  long ago has been ready and excellently equipped for  putting to sea: for the bilge-water has been all baled out,  the mast has been hoisted, the sail spread, every one of the  oars supplied with its thong, and as far as I am concerned,  nothing prevents our hauling our little anchor aboard, and  proceeding on our voyage. But that Hermes is behind his  time, whereas he ought to have been here long since. Our  ferry-boat, therefore, as you see, has not a single passenger  on board, though it might have made the passage three  times to-day already.

</head>
<p>[MENIPPUS, the Cynic philosopher, just returned from a  visit of inquiry to Hades, meets his friend Philonides, who  earnestly begs him to reveal the reasons, and the experiences, of his interesting journey. Thus adjured, with some  display of reluctance, Menippus, after having been assured  by his friend that human life has not at all improved  during his absence, professes that he had been impelled to  take so hazardous a journey by an ardent desire to learn  the truths of philosophy and life-vainly sought alike in  the popular Theology and in the schools of the Philosophers, or Sophists, who were all at variance one with the  other, and contradicted themselves ; while they failed to  practise their own teaching.</p>
<p>Thus forced to trust to his own resources, after much  mental inquietude, he determines to go to Babylon, a

<note type="footnote" n="1"><p><foreign xml:lang="grc">Μένιππος η̋ Νεκυομαντεία</foreign>. This Lucianic Dialogue (for its 
ness is doubtful, as shewn, among modern critics, by Wieland and  Lehmann) borrows its alternative title from the Eleventh Book of the  Odyssey, of which it is, in great part, a parody. It is a sort of epitome  of the Dialogues of the Dead and other writings of the great master,  which satirize the popular theology respecting the Under-World, and is  of high interest as a résumé of this province of Hellenic superstition. </p>

<p>Rabelais (who is indebted, especially, to the True History) borrows one
of his most instructive scenes from this Dialogue. In the battle with  the Dipsodes, on behalf of the Amaurotes (the " shadowy " or "fleeting"  people, a name suggested to Rabelais by the Utopia of More, himself  indebted to Lucian), Pantagruel's companion, Epistemon—who loses his  head, but afterwards recovers it through the skilful surgery of Panurge  -upon returning from his temporary sojourn in Hades, reports the  altogether reversed conditions of some of the heroes of antiquity and of  later times. (Gargantua and Pantagruel, ii.) The Spanish satirist,  Quevedo, also, has obligations to the Menippus, in his Sueños. </p></note>

principal seat of the Magi and the Mystics, and by their  occult science obtain admission to the Under-World, and,  like his prototype, Odysseus, consult the soul of the Theban  prophet Teiresias. Arrived at Babylon, Menippus introduces himself to one of these Magi, named Mithrobarzanes,  and, with considerable difficulty, obtains from him promise  of assistance. Under the tuition of the Magus, he enters  upon a course of purificatory and mystic rites, and a strict  dietetic regimen, until he is properly prepared for the  dreadful descent. Embarking on the Euphrates, they sail  to a certain secluded place, where they leave their boat,  and begin the prescribed infernal rites and sacrifices—still  faithfully following the authority of the poet of the Odyssey  -invoking Hekate, the Erinyes <stage>(or Furies)</stage>, and all the  daemons. The Earth opens, and the various infernal sights  are revealed. Descending, with much difficulty, the travellers  secure places on board Charon's boat, already overladen  with dead men, who, for the most part, had received their  quietus in battle. The lion's skin, and mane of Herakles,  with which the Cynic had provided himself, secure for  them places on board, and a courteous reception from the  Ferryman of the Styx. Disembarking, with the Magus for  guide, Menippus makes his way, through "squealing"  ghosts, to the tribunal of Minos. There they see the various  punishments for crime and injustice administered, and a  novel sort of witnesses in the shadows of the accused.  Among those most severely punished appear the arrogant  Rich ; and Menippus does not lose his opportunity for  the exercise of his satirical faculty. Leaving the judgment-seat of Minos, they proceed to the scenes of punishment,  and view the various instruments and infliction of torture.</p>
<p>In the Acherusian plains, they verify the accounts of the  poet of the Odyssey, as to the <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀμένηνα καρήνα</foreign>, and other  particulars. The <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἰσοτιμία</foreign> is found to be complete and indubitable. Thersites and Nireus, Irus and Alkinous, have  nothing whatever to distinguish them one from the other.  Under the influence of this spectacle, Menippus compares  human life to a gigantic public Procession, and to the  Stage, where the several constituents play their diverse  parts, for a short time, liable to extremest vicissitudes of  fortune. Mausolus, and other vain-glorious princes, with
<pb n="264"/>
their " lying trophies " and inscriptions, in particular, fall  under the Cynic's satire; and the Earthly kings and  potentates who, in the Under-World, cut so abject and  inglorious a figure. As for Sokrates and Diogenes, they  still pursue their peculiar and favourite occupations. At  this point of his narrative, Menippus is reminded that he  has omitted to quote the solemn Decree against the Plutocrats, passed by the Popular Assembly of Hades (to which  he had referred at the beginning of his report), the purport of which is the apportionment of a severe retribution.</p>
<p>At the point of going back to the Upper-World,  Menippus approaches Teiresias, and begs him to reveal the  secret, which was the object of his descent. This the  prophet's ghost does with laconic brevity. The philosophers then return, by a short cut, to Earth, near to the  Cave of Trophonius.]</p>

Well, I, as  long as I was in my teens, when I listened to Homer and  Hesiod recounting the wars and seditions not only of the  demi-gods, but actually even of the Gods themselves before  now ; nay, further, even their adulteries, and violences, and  rapes and feuds, their expulsions of parents, and their  marriages with sisters-all this I used to consider to be  good and right, and I tickled my fancy in no ordinary  degree with it all.

stood fixed in great doubt and perplexity, not knowing  where I should turn myself. For, neither could I ever  believe that the Gods committed adultery, and engaged in  fratricidal war, unless they held about these things, that  they were really honourable: nor that the legislators would  encourage the opposite to these practices, unless they supposed their prohibitions to be advantageous. And, when I  continued to be in doubt, I resolved to go to those whom  they call " philosophers," and put myself in their hands,  and pray them to use me as they wished, and to point out  to me some sure and simple way of life. With this disposition, I say, I approached them ; and I did not know that  I was forcing myself, as the adage is, from the smoke into  the fire itself.<ref n="1"/> For plainly, upon close examination, I found  among them ignorance in a very special degree, and doubt  and uncertainty greater than elsewhere; so that very quickly  they proved to me that the way of life of the ignorant and  common sort of people was golden in comparison.

As for their theories of the Universe, what need for  me even to speak, who was nauseated in daily listening to  their “ideas,” incorporealities," “atoms,” "vacuums,"  and a crowd of such like names ? And what was the most  absurd of all strange things was-that, while each one of  them spoke of matters most opposed one to the other, he  would supply exceedingly irresistible and persuasive arguments ; so that you could not possibly contradict either  him who affirmed the same thing to be " heat," nor him  who asserted it to be " cold "-and that, though yon knew  perfectly well that a thing could never possibly be warm  and cold at the same moment.

<p><label n="Menippus-16">Menippus</label> Well remembered, for I don't know how I  wandered entirely from my story, when I had purposed to  speak about that. Well, while I was staying with them,  the presiding magistrates proposed a meeting of the  Popular Assembly in respect of the common interests. As,  then, I observed a number of them running together, I at  once mixed myself up with the dead men, and forthwith  became myself, too, one of their members of Parliament.  Other matters were duly settled, and, last of all, the case  of the Rich. When, you must know, many and terrible  accusations had been brought against them-violence, arrogance, haughtiness, and injustice-at length a certain  popular leader rose, and read the Decree to this effect :-</p>

<p>Such, I assure you, were the proceedings in the  Popular Assembly. I—in pursuance of the object of my visit  -approached Teiresias, and, after explaining everything,  begged him to tell me what sort of life he considers to be  about the best. Then with a laugh-he is a somewhat blind,  little old man, sallow, and shrill-voiced—“ My son," says he,  " I know the cause of your doubt and perplexity, that it  originated with the philosophers, who do not agree among  themselves : but it is not permitted me to reveal it to you, for  it has been forbidden by Rhadamanthys." " Oh! pray, don't  refuse, my good little father," said I, " but tell me, and don't  despise me who grope about in life blinder than yourself."  Thereupon, you must know, he took me aside and withdrew to  a considerable distance from the rest, and, quietly stooping  to my ear, he says : "The best and soundest life is that of  persons in private station. So do you, leaving off the folly  of inquiring into transcendental subtleties, and searching  into final ends and causes, and rejecting with contempt  their learned sophisms and syllogisms, and deeming such  things mere trifling and nonsense, search diligently for this  one thing alone-how, making wise use of what you have,  you may pass by with a smile of contempt most opinions,  and pursue nothing with too serious aim."

And, in fact, be led me to a certain spot, darker and  murkier than the rest, pointing to a certain dim and faint  light in the distance flowing, as it were, through a chink.  "That," said he, "is the shrine of Trophonius, and from  that place the people of Boeotia make their descent.  Ascend, then, by this road, and immediately you will be  upon Hellenic soil."
