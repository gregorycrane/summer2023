The Assembly is now dismissed. But, whenever Hermes  shall make proclamation, come each of you with clear  testimonials, and plain proofs of your titles—the father's  and mother's names, and whence, and how, he or she became  a divinity, his tribe, and wardsmen.3 As, in the case of  whoever shall not exhibit these, whether a claimant has a  big temple upon the Earth, and whether he is regarded  by men as divine, the Commission will not trouble themselves.\n",

Of their books some he interpreted and expounded,  many of them even he himself wrote ; and they regarded him in the  light of some divine being, set him up as their legislator, and chose  and publicly acknowledged him as their special patron [here occurs the  suspected hiatus.

      "countryman of Lucian, born at Gadara, in Hollow Syria, in the first  century B.C. He belonged to the Cynic sect, and by his satirical  writings is one of the most famous of that school: but his cynicism did  not prevent him from making an extensive fortune in trade as a banker,  which he lost by the bad faith of a trusted friend. He then put an end  to his life. His Satires are known to us only through the fragments of  the Suturae Menippeae of Varro (his contemporary), the learned Latin  antiquarian : one of the best of which is the Prometheus Liber. Cicero  (Quaest. Academ.) alludes to the Menippean Satires as displaying profound philosophy as well as wit. Marcus Aurelius (<foreign xml:lang=\"grc\">Τά εἰς'Εαυτὸν</foreign>)  especially mentions him as a distinguished mocker of human life  (<foreign xml:lang=\"grc\">χλευαστής</foreign>). The predecessors of Menippus, in this line, were Demokritus of Abdera (<foreign xml:lang=\"grc\">Τα περ</foreign>ì <foreign xml:lang=\"grc\">τω̃νι</foreign>v '<foreign xml:lang=\"grc\">Αδου̃</foreign>), and one or two other lessknown names. One of the most interesting of the Lucianic Dialogues,  which is a sort of epitome of the Dialogues of the Dead, and w hich  might well have given Dante hints for his Inferno, derives its title from the Cynic of Gadara—<foreign xml:lang=\"grc\">Μενίππος ἢ Νεκυομαντεία</foreign>. <foreign xml:lang=\"grc\">Κύων</foreign>, \"the Dog,\" is\n",

Scipio does not figure in  this scene; and it is a curious fact that no Roman is admitted into  Lucian's Elysium. By Livy (xxxv. 14) Hannibal is represented as  much more modest than he appears in this Dialogue; for, in reply  to a question of Scipio, he pronounces Alexander to be the first of  military commanders, Pyrrhus, King of Epeirus, second, and himself  third; although, if he had been so fortunate as to conquer his questioner, as he had the other Roman generals, he would not have hesitated  to give the precedence to himself.

The worst blow, to which dogmas, that  are not grounded upon Reason, can be submitted, is when one holds up  their mutual contradictions to the light. One spares oneself, by this  means, the trouble of refutation, and can calmly see them, like the  armed men sown by Kadmus, annihilate themselves. This is the spectacle which Lucian gives us, in this Dialogue, in his best manner. </p>\n",
      "<p>\" The inconsistencies of the Pagan doctrines of a Fate, of the \n",
      "dence of their Gods, and of the system of Rewards and Punishments  after death, appears in it in a light, by whose brilliance Jupiter himself  is quite dazed and reduced to silence ; or, what is still more humiliating,  to so miserable a shift, that Cyniscus himself, at last, out of mere pity,  and content with having deprived him, after complete overthrow in open  field, of his power, his dignity, and his kingdom, and leading him in  triumph mortally wounded, presents him with his life for so long as in  the course of Nature it might be expected to last. The questions which  he lays before Jupiter had, in fact, been already debated in the Jupiter  in Tragedy, between Damis and Timokles, not to the advantage of the  party of the Gods. But Lucian, as it seems, held it to be necessary to  deliver a last decisive assault. Jupiter had to be driven out altogether  from his last lurking-holes, and to be convicted of his wicked deeds so  completely, that the most shameless sycophant must blush any longer  to undertake his defence. This it is, that Lucian, as it seems to me, in  this little Dialogue, in so masterly a way, and with so much fineness of  touch, manages to effect, that I know no more complete example of the  transformation of the antipodes of reason (as Homer expresses it) ' into  earth and water.'\" </p></note>\n",

As, however, nothing was firm or stereotyped in the Greek Theology, the common belief did not hinder many,  to whom the consequences of such teaching were a stumbling-block, from  thinking otherwise. Pausanias, where he speaks of the statues of Jupiter  Olympius at Megara, gives as the reason why the Horae and Parcae are  represented hovering above the God's head, that it was pretty generally  recognized that Pepromene (‘Fate’), is subject to Jupiter alone, and  that the Horcae are ruled by him, and kept in due order. But Lucian's  Jupiter, weak as he was, had, at least, so much understanding as to  know that a Necessity, subject to his absolute will, could be no Necessity;  and is, accordingly, resolved not to overstrain his power, either in regard  of the Parcae that hover over his head at Megara, or of the statues and  altars, which, according to the testimony of Pausanias, he possessed  here and there under the name of Moiragetes (' Ruler of the Fates'):  but, rather, with a good grace confessed that not only could he not alter  the laws of Fate, but that he was, as regards his own person, subject to  them. Lucian could with so much the greater justice make his Jupiter  confess this, because the Delphic Apollo himself, when Kroesus bitterly  reproached him after the unlucky event of his war with Cyrus, excused  himself in the same way (Herod. i. 91).”—Wieland. </p></note>\n",
