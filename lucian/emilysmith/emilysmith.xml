<head>INTRODUCTION.</head><p>
IF these translations from the works
of Lucian had been made from newly
discovered manuscripts, or if he were
a living author, writing at this moment in Spain or Denmark, so that
what he has to say might come fresh and without
prejudice to the minds of English readers, the task
of introducing him would be as light as possible,
for no writer is more frankly ready to speak for
himself. Not even Benvenuto Cellini makes a
cleaner breast of it than does the hero of The
Ass, who, it is fair to suppose, shares Lucian's
ideas on most subjects. Not even Dumas chronicles the faults and virtues of his characters
with a more engaging naivete than the author
of A True History. But this quality of simplicity in a writer, this easy approachableness
and absolute good faith, which rank among the
most endearing and lastingly popular traits he
can exhibit, are seldom left undisturbed. In Lucian's case a great number of those who found
him pleasant reading have made the poor return.
of trying to show that he is also something else.
The fair landscape he opens to us, blooming and


<pb n="vi"/>

cheerful as the Happy Islands that he tells of, is
no longer the safe and tranquil place the wayfarer used to find it, for footsore Erudition, having munched her bread and cheese beneath his
trees, marked her commendation of the spot by
sinking shafts in it, and she now stands grimy at
the pit-mouth, inviting all comers to descend.</p>

<p>
The object of this introduction, then, is not so
much to suggest what the reader is to think of
Lucian as to put him on his guard against some
current notions and beg him to judge for himself.
The question which has chiefly been debated
with regard to him ever since the time of Suidas
and the scholiasts concerns his attitude towards
things divine. On the one hand, he certainly
smote the gods of the heathen in a very commendable way, so that some of his works were
thought wholesome reading by Gregory of Nazianzus, and others. But, on the other hand, he
spoke rather cavalierly of the Christians in one
or two passages, was suspected of having Jonah
in mind when he wrote A True History, and introduced a habit of thought which might be as
harmful to the new religion as to old ones; so
that Suidas uses hard language about him and
says he came to a fitting end, being eaten by
dogs. This opinion has had numbers of adherents ever since, and has been voiced now and
again by a great theologian like Tschirner and perpetuated by minor writers. "I confess," says Sir
Thomas Browne, "every country hath its Machiavel,


<pb n="vii"/>


 every age its Lucian, whereof common heads
must not hear, nor more advanced judgments too
rashly venture on: it is the rhetoric of Satan, and
may pervert a loose or prejudicate belief."</p>

<p>
Of course, such a view could not escape the
tendency to rehabilitate doubtful classical characters; the defence of Lucian has been as energetic and minute as the accusation, and the most
disputed point in the case is his spiritual affinity
to another great man of letters. I cannot tell
who first likened him to Voltaire-possibly Voltaire-but the notion of a similarity of genius between the two was joyfully caught at by the
detractors of the senior writer. Hume openly
admired him, and this helped to make the comparison a commonplace of literary criticism. But,
although even Wieland's critical sense was satisfied by the formula, so that Lucian's unconscious
freedom of speech seemed to him to be like Voltaire and his naturalness like Rousseau, yet the
doctrine was soon attacked from two different
sides by those who considered it injurious to Lucian, and also by those who considered it injurious to Voltaire. The most thorough-going and
the most diverting attempt to wrap Lucian in respectability has been made by Professor K. G.
Jacob, who represents him as the author of a
theory of social reform by the education of the individual. He declares that Lucian clothed his
ideas in flippancy (as Lucretius did his in verse)
to make them more acceptable, but that he was


<pb n="viii"/>



at bottom a serious person with a mission. Naturally, in the course of his exposition he falls.
foul of the likeness to Voltaire, and denies it in
terms very damaging to the eighteenth century
school of philosophy. But M. Croizet, writing
fifty years later, denies it quite as vigorously on
other grounds. While admitting that their styles
have some common points, he bids us contrast
Voltaire, the man of science, with Lucian, the rhetorician, and points out that while Voltaire interested himself in everything from Newton's discoveries to Shakespeare's plays, Lucian not only
knows nothing of physical science or mathematics, but treats them with pleasantry as the playthings of disordered imaginations.</p>

<p>
Bernays will not even admit superficial resemblances, and for the rest declares Lucian not only
an ill-read trifler with solemn subjects, but a
gloomy atheist, in contrast with whom he paints
Voltaire as a rather religious man, doing his best
to spread his own ideas of natural justice. But
Bernays is not chiefly concerned with Lucian's
general religious attitude. He acquits him of a
deliberate attack on Christianity, pointing out
that he cared not a straw for it one way or the
other, because he was preoccupied with his antipathy to the sect of Cynic philosophers. He finds
that Lucian was a professed Epicurean, although
possessed of the slightest possible knowledge of
the doctrines he upheld, and traces through his
writings a systematic polemic against the Cynics.


<pb n="ix"/>

</p>

<p>
In this hurly-burly of opinion those have not
been wanting who thought him a Christian in disguise, and it is often said that whether consciously or unconsciously he did more than any other
uninspired writer to make straight the path of the
new religion. But M. Renan celebrates him as
the incarnation of sanity in an age of superstition,
rejecting Christianity along with every other form
of the unverifiable, and applying to all religious
phenomena the touchstone of his common-sense
in a solid, thorough-going way which must have
escaped M. Croizet's attention when he denied
him a place beside Voltaire as a systematic
thinker.</p>

<p>
It is with theories like these that commentators
on Lucian have busied themselves, and this is not
the place to examine them in detail or attempt to
supplant them. But turn from them, and look for
a moment at the man himself and the times he
lived in. The age of the Antonines was one of
bodily and spiritual adventure, not in the sense
in which the age of Perikles was, or the age of
Elizabeth; not of heroic, history-making adventure, but of the small, personal enterprise of the
average man. The Roman Empire had been in
existence longer than our republic, and its material wealth and public order were relatively as
great. In that day, as in our own, the practical
achievements of a people not given to purely intellectual activity produced on men's imaginations
the effects of a series of brilliant generalizations.


<pb n="x"/>


The white Roman roads over which the legions
thundered were just as passable for the market-gardener and his ass or the travelling-carriage of
a fine lady, followed by her lap-dog and Greek-master in a humbler vehicle. These roads spoke
of romance backed by security, making it plain to
every one that a traveller need no longer be an
Herodotus or an Alexander, and so lured the
Roman cockney forth to write his name on the
Pyramids. With the travelling habit there grew
up, of course, the study of comparative manners
and a cosmopolitan way of life. Questions of
practical conduct preoccupied even those professing to follow abstract thought. Athens had
become a quiet university town, holding fastidiously aloof from the vulgar materiality of Roman
life, but feeling in her own way the predominance
of action over thought. The days were over
when an Athenian citizen setting forth to market of a morning might be delayed indefinitely
by a discussion of the immortality of the soul
with the shop-keepers. Rhetoric was the chief
object of pursuit in the schools, and was studied
not disinterestedly, but with an eye to making a
living as soon as possible. The great rhetoricians made tours in the provinces as lecturers do
nowadays, and found them extremely lucrative.
Life provided the clever men of the age with
nothing more than themes for rhetorical exhibitions on the one hand and moral aphorisms on
the other. All opinions were tolerated because


<pb n="xi"/>


nothing was too paradoxical to be defended by an
orator. The Empire suffered every man to keep
the religion of his country, though it had no patience with such obscure, seditious sects as that
of the persons calling themselves Christians (after
the "sophist," their leader), who courted death
for perversity's sake, and flouted Jupiter in the
market-place, and blushed for Venus.</p>

<p>
Into this world there was born in a remote
Syrian town, for his own entertainment and our
great advantage, a man with a relish for life, an
eye for the bizarre, and a wonderful gift of expressing himself. In the little speech which
opens this book he tells how he was attracted to
the learning of the time, and burst away from the
traditions of his family and the little town of his
birth, as clever boys have been doing since history began. The disadvantage of being born to
a provincial dialect was heavy, but he overcame it
brilliantly. For about five years he wandered
among the cities of Ionia, probably studying under the itinerant professors of rhetoric. He visited Greece, lived for some time in Antioch as an
advocate, travelled through Syria and Egypt as a
sophist, and saw Rome on his way to Gaul, where
he stayed for ten years, amassing a fortune sufficient to enable him to return to the East. It was
at this time that he visited his birthplace, Samosata, and told his townsmen the story of his boyish choice. He then removed his family to
Athens, where he probably lived until he was


<pb n="xii"/>



presented with an official appointment in Egypt.
This happened when he was seventy, and he is
said to have lived many years to enjoy it. These
facts, which we gather chiefly from his own writings, are scanty; but they tell us enough to show
that he lived the life of his time, seeing many
cities of men and noting their ways, and his
works are the offspring of his note-book. That he
saw things chiefly from a humorous point of view
will not be set down to his discredit at present,
although it undoubtedly created great scandal at
the time. It is difficult to the historic sense to
feel shocked at blasphemies against a dead religion, and the modern reader is affected by
Lucian's Zeus much as he is by Thackeray's Valaroso, King of Paphlagonia; but perhaps the
feeling raised in the minds of many people by
Mr. Arnold's parable of the three Lord Shaftsburys may represent the shock that Lucian gave
his contemporaries. However, granting the shock
to have been never so great, it was administered
by a man to whom Zeus was amusing rather than
objectionable, a man whose first object was to entertain, not to tread in the footprints of Epicurus,
and free the human race from the debasing fear
of the supernatural.</p>

<p>
He was a man of his time; not a thinker, but
an observer. He had a rhetorical belief in some
of the more obvious forms of virtue, and a genuine active belief in literature; but beyond these
he had not only very few beliefs but hardly any


<pb n="xiii"/>


opinions. To ask for such from him is, to use his
own phrase, to milk the he-goat into a sieve.
Those who read him to determine whether or not
he was a scientific thinker, or a reliable historian,
or a good citizen, start interesting questions no
doubt, but they obscure for the world at large the
fact that he is above all things a great writer of
light literature. With almost equal propriety one
might try to determine Thackeray's religious
views from his chapters on "Clerical Snobs." Lucian laughed at the philosophers of his day as he
found them, studying them as a conspicuous part
of society, but to parody the catch-words of a
school of thought is not to attack it with intent
to kill. It is made a reproach to him that after
having evidently read his Plato, he could so grossly misrepresent Plato's Sokrates in the Sale of
Lives. Certainly, he read his Plato, and to good
purpose, but the true import of what he read was
not what he wanted, and he was at no pains to
gather it. What he did gather and make worthy
use of was an Attic style such as had not been
written since Demosthenes. He read enormously among the best writers, and profited directly by
what he read; indeed, his list of "books that
have influenced me," if it could be entirely recovered, would make an admirable curriculum for
any student of Greek. All this material he melted together with some alloy of modernisms into a
style of great elegance and charm, made piquant
by the fact that it is not quite the real thing but


<pb n="xiv"/>


a conscious imitation, after the fashion of Henry
Esmond or The Master of Ballantrae. The selections translated in this book give a fair idea of
the variety of forms in which he used his gift and
show the structural skill which he brought to bear
in each. He used the comic dialogue more freely than any other form of composition, but his
stories seem to show greater literary genius than
the dialogues themselves. Even in this age of
short stories it would not be easy to match A True
History for ability and workmanship, and each of
the narratives of Toxaris stands out round and
neat as a coin, where a single gesture does the
work of the analytic novelist. Much of the
charm of the original is lost in the translation, as
the coloring of a face is lost in a photograph, but
the outline, the structure, cannot be hidden. This
is so striking and so admirable that it is hoped
the reader of The Ass will forget to disturb himself about the philosophical views of the author
further than to call him, in the words of one of
his best friends:

<quote>
<l>The sage who laughed the world away,</l>
<l>Who mocked at gods and men and care,</l>
<l>More sweet of voice than Rabelais,</l>
<l>And lighter-hearted than Voltaire.</l>

When I had just left school, and was
beginning to grow up, my father consulted with his friends as to what further training he should give me. The
majority decided against a liberal education; it would demand, they said, great labor,
much time, considerable expense, and brilliant
good-luck; whereas our means were small and
called for some speedy succor. Now, if I should
learn one of the industrial arts, I would, in the
first place, be immediately able to support myself
by my trade, and live no longer at my father's expense, great boy that I was. And in a short time
I could gladden his heart by bringing home my
earnings every day.
Accordingly, this question was made the theme
of a second deliberation: What trade is the best
and the easiest to learn, is becoming to a free citizen, and calls for least expense in tools while it
furnishes a sufficient income? Each member of
the council recommended a different trade, according to his theory or experience. But my father looked towards my uncle-for my mother's
brother was there, reputed to be a master of the


<pb n="4"/>



statuary's art—and said, “It would be unseemly
if
any
other craft should carry the day when you
are present. So take him" (pointing to me), “receive him in charge, and teach him to be a good
stone-worker and mason and sculptor. He has
ability to become even this last, and a natural
skill in that direction, as you know."
The ground of his opinion was my childish play
at modelling in wax. Whenever the school-masters let me go, I would fall to scraping the wax
from my writing-tablets and fashioning cows and
horses, and, upon my word, even men, too, and
with some truth to nature--at least my father
thought so. The school-masters used to flog me
for them; but now this very thing won me praise
for my talents, and great hopes that I would
speedily master my trade were based on my prowess in modelling. As soon as a propitious day was
settled on for beginning my trade, I was handed
over to my uncle, with no very strong objection
on my part, for it seemed to me to offer a delightful form of play and a chance to cut a figure
before my mates, if I should be seen carving
gods and making little statues for myself and my
chosen favorites. The first thing I did was what
might have been expected of a beginner. My
uncle gave me a chisel of some sort and bade me
work gently at a flat block that lay in the middle
of the room, addressing me in the words of the


<pb n="5"/>

THE DREAM.
5
proverb: "Well begun is half done." But in my
ignorance I bore down too hard and broke the
block. My uncle, in a fury, caught up a stick
that lay to his hand and struck at my devoted
head in no gentle or persuasive fashion, so that
tears were my introduction to art.
I ran away from him and came home, bawling
all the way with streaming eyes, and I related the
story of the stick and denounced what I called
my uncle's brutality, adding that he treated me
thus from jealousy lest I should surpass him in
his art. My mother was greatly incensed, and
called her brother all manner of hard names, and
when night came I fell asleep, still in tears, and
my mind was busy all night long.
Now, up to this point all that I have told is
the laughable history of a hobbledehoy; but listen, my friends, to a sequel no longer contemptible, but calling for close attention. For, to quote
Homer, "The gods sent me a vision in my sleep
through the ambrosial night," so vivid that it fell
in nowise short of reality. To this day, after so
great a lapse of time, the forms I saw remain in
my eyes and the sounds I heard ring in my ears,
and this shows how distinct it all was. Two
women laid hold of me, each taking a hand and
dragging me towards herself with great energy
and strength; indeed, they almost tore me asunder in their contention. For first one of them


<pb n="6"/>



would prevail and all but get possession of me,
and then I would be plucked away again by her
rival. And they screamed in concert, one of
them crying that it was her property she wished
to get hold of, and the other that the first was
vainly striving for what did not belong to her.
This first woman was masculine and workmanlike, with rough hair and callous hands. Her garments were girded up and full of marble chips,
just as my uncle's were wont to be when he was
polishing stone. But the other was of a very fair
countenance, and her figure was shapely and her
clothing well-ordered. Now at last they left it
to me to decide which of them I would fain join.
And first the harsh, man-like one spoke :
66
'My child," she said, "I am the Art of Stonecutting, which you began yesterday to learn,
friendly to you and a relative by blood, inasmuch
as your grandfather"—naming my mother's father-" was a stone-cutter, and your two uncles,
and both of them are very well thought of on my
account. If you are willing to hold aloof from
this woman's folly and nonsense "-pointing to
her rival" and to come and dwell with me, you
will in the first place be generously nurtured and
have strong shoulders, and you will be a stranger
to all jealousy; you will never leave your fatherland and family to go out into foreign countries,
and it is not for mere words that you will win praise


<pb n="7"/>

THE DREAM.

from every one. Do not be repelled by my shabby exterior and my soiled garments, for it was
after beginning thus that the great Pheidias, too,
showed the world his Zeus, and Polykleitos fashioned his Hera, and Myron won praise and Praxiteles wonder. Now these men are worshipped
with the gods. If, then, you should become one
of these, you, too, would certainly be famous
throughout the world. You will make your father, too, an object of envy, and turn all eyes
towards the land that bore you."
Thus, and at even greater length, spoke Handicraft, sprinkling her speech from end to end with
stammering and rusticities in her eager argument
and effort to persuade me. But I can no longer
call it to mind, for most of it has already escaped
my memory. When she now had made an end,
the other began, somewhat in this way:
"I, my child, am Culture, an acquaintance and
familiar of yours already, although you have not
yet made full trial of me. This person has told
you in advance what you will gain, forsooth, by
becoming a stone-cutter; namely, that you will be
nothing but a workman, toiling with your body,
on which all your hopes of a livelihood will depend. You will be yourself obscure; your gains
will be small and sordid, your mind dwarfed,
your progress despicable. Your friends will not
seek you out, your enemies will not fear you,


<pb n="8"/>



your townsfolk will not envy you. You will be
simply an artisan, one of the undistinguished
crowd, tripping over every obstacle, and the obedient servant of every one capable of expressing
himself, while you live the life of a dumb beast,
a treasure-trove for any stronger man than you.
And even if you should become a Pheidias or a
Polykleitos, and should produce many marvellous
works, it is your art that the world will praise,
and not one of those who behold them, if he has
sense, would pray to become like you.
For they
will deem you just what you are, a mechanic, an
artisan, living by the sweat of your brow.
66
But if you will hearken to me, I will display
before you, to begin with, many works and wondrous doings of men of old, and I will report
their sayings to you and make you master, so to
speak, of all learning. I will adorn your soul,
which is the dominant power within you, with
many graces to wit, self-control, righteousness,
reverence, gentleness, equity, wisdom, strength,
love of beauty, taste for the worthiest pursuits.
For these are the things that really make the
spotless beauty of the soul. No sequence of
events in the past or present will escape you;
nay, by my help you will behold even the future,
and I will teach you erelong the nature of the
whole universe, the divine as well as the human.
You who are now poor, the son of a nobody,


<pb n="9"/>

meditating the adoption of such an ignoble craft,
shall be shortly felicitated and envied by the
world; you shall have honor and praise and glory
among the noblest; you shall be clad like this
-here she indicated her own garments, which
were splendid in the extreme-" and you shall
be deemed worthy of office and eminence. When
you go abroad you will not be unknown and obscure in a foreign land. I will set such marks
upon you that every one who sees you will nudge
his neighbor and point you out with his finger,
saying, 'That is he.'
"If any serious thing befall your friends, or
even the state at large, all will look to you.
When you chance to say anything the crowd will
listen open-mouthed and marvel at you, and envy
your gift and your father's good-fortune. And
this immortality which they say is sometimes bestowed on men I will store up for you. For even
when you yourself perish from the world you will
never cease from companionship with the cultured and conversation with the noblest. You
know whose son Demosthenes was, and yet I
made him the man he was. You know that
Aischines' mother was a dancer, and yet Philip
paid court to him for my sake. Sokrates himself
was brought up under the eye of this Art of Stonecutting, but you hear how his praises are sung on
all sides from the moment when he perceived the
99


<pb n="10"/>



better part and ran away from her and deserted
to me. But if you reject such men as these, and
brilliant achievements and ennobling words and
a seemly guise, and honor and glory and fame
and distinction, and political power and office,
and respect as an orator and envy as a wit, you
will wear a dirty shirt and take on the look of a
slave; your hands will be full of crowbars and
gravers and chisels and picks; you will stoop
over your work, grovelling, prostrate, and altogether stunted; you will never look up or fix
your thoughts on any manly, liberal theme; and
you will ponder how to make your works symmetrical and well-shaped, but for your own symmetry and shapeliness you will take no care at all,
making yourself of less worth than your stones."
While she was still speaking thus, and without
waiting to hear her to the end, I seemed to spring
up and leave the ugly woman in laborer's guise,
and cross over to Culture right joyfully, particularly since that stick came into my head, and how
the other had caused me a beating only yesterday
on my first acquaintance with her. When she
was deserted she at first went into a passion,
smiting her hands together and grinding her
teeth; but finally she grew rigid and turned to
stone, as we hear Niobe did. Now even if this
experience of her's seems extraordinary, do not
disbelieve it, for dreams work wonders.


<pb n="11"/>

THE DREAM.
II
The other woman looked at me and said, "Now
I will repay you for the justice of your judgment.
Come forthwith and mount this car "-pointing to
a car drawn by winged horses resembling Pegasus
-"so that you may see what you would have
missed knowing if you had not followed me."
Thereupon I mounted the car, and she drove;
and borne aloft I beheld, from the east to the
west, cities and nations and peoples, and I sowed
something upon the earth like Triptolemos. However, what it was that I sowed I do not now remember, but only this, that the people looked up
at me from beneath and praised me, and sped me
on my way wherever I passed in my flight.
When she had shown these things to me, and
me to these admiring people, she brought me
down again, no longer dressed as I was when I
flew away, but seeming to myself to arrive like a
grandee born to the purple. She came upon my
father himself, who was standing by and waiting
for me, showed him my clothes and me, in what
state I came, and reminded him, too, of the decision they had come near making about me.
These are the things that I remember seeing
when hardly more than a boy, I think, and still
terrified at the thought of a flogging.
But in the midst of my narrative some one says,
"Dear me, how tedious and long-winded his
dream is." Or another interrupts with, "This is


<pb n="12"/>



a mid-winter night's dream, when the nights are
longest; or perhaps he is a three-night man himself, like Hercules. How did it enter his head
to spin out this nonsense for us and recall the
nights of his childhood and old, decrepit dreams,
served up with the chill of death on them and
stale already? Does he take us, forsooth, for
interpreters of dreams?"
No, my friend, and neither did Xenophon relate
his dream when he thought his father's house
was afire and the rest of it—you know his dream
-as a bit of acting, nor was he consciously talking nonsense, seeing that he was in the midst of
warfare and distress and surrounded by enemies.
No, his narrative had a useful purpose, and so I,
too, have related this dream to you to the end
that young men may turn to the better part and
lay hold of culture, particularly those who are
tempted by poverty to play truant and sink to the
worse life, to the destruction of what may have

be fortified by hearing my story, and will take
me for a sufficient example if they bear in mind.

and that my desire was for culture, so that I never
lost heart in my old poverty, and, lastly, the guise

least of it, not less famous than any of the statuaries.

ZEUS THE TRAGEDIAN.

ERMES. O Zeus, why wand'rest, selfcommuning, lone,
And sicklied o'er with this pale student's hue?
Make me the partner of thy sorrow's load,
Nor scorn the prattle of a lowly friend.
Athene. Yea, sire, great Kronides, our father
and highest of rulers,
I, the clear-eyed and divine, the Trito-born, clasp
thee imploring.
Hide not thy grief in thine heart. Tell it forth
that thy children may know it.
What biting care dost thou hold in thy brain
and thy bosom? What anguish
Wrings that deep groan from thy soul and yellows thy fair, ruddy color?
Zeus. There no woe that happens, sooth to
tell,
No pain, no chance-born theme of tragedy,
Of which the godhead beareth not the load.
Athene. Great heav'n! What prologue doth
begin his tale.


<pb n="16"/>



Zeus. O earthy offspring of the earth, fell race,
And thou, Prometheus, what woe hast thou
wrought!
Athene. What is 't? We are the band of thine
own kin.
Zeus. Thunderbolt, sounding afar, how shall
thy hurtling crash save me?
Hera. Keep your temper, Zeus, since I cannot
answer you in comedy metre as the others do,
nor have I swallowed Euripides whole so as to
take my part in the drama when you give me the
cue. Do you imagine that I don't know the
cause of your distress?
Zeus. "Thou dost not know, els hadst thou
shrieked aloud."
Hera. I know that the sum and substance of
your trouble comes from love-making. Of course,
I do not shriek, for I am used to this insulting
treatment at your hands. Undoubtedly you have
come upon some Danae or Semele or Europa
again, and are attacked with love, and so you are
scheming to become a bull or a satyr, or to pour
down as a shower of golden rain through the roof
into your lady-love's lap. These groans, these
tears, this pallor are symptoms of the lover and
nobody else.
Zeus. Poor, simple thing, do you think, then,
that my present affairs have to do with love-making and such-like child's play?


<pb n="17"/>

ZEUS THE TRAGEDIAN.

Hera. Being Zeus, you are disturbed by nothing else, I know.
Zeus. O Hera, things divine are in extremity.
As the saying is, it is touch and go with us
whether we are still to be honored and to receive
the gifts that are offered up on earth, or whether
we are to be disregarded altogether and held utterly insignificant.
Hera. Surely the earth has not produced another race of giants? Or have the Titans broken
their bonds and overpowered their guard, and
taken up arms against us again?
Zeus. "Take heart. Beneath the earth all things
are well."
Hera. Then what could happen to frighten us?
If you have no anxiety of that kind I do not
see why you have favored us with this little dramatic exhibition.
Zeus. Hera, Timokles the Stoic and Damis the
Epicurean held a discussion yesterday on the
doctrine of providence. I do not know how the
question arose, but the audience was large and
respectable, and that, to my mind, was the most
annoying feature of the affair. Damis denied that
the gods exist or have any hand whatever in the
ordering and administration of the world. But
the worthy Timokles strove to defend our side,
and just then a crowd of people streamed in, so
that the meeting came to no decision, but dis-
2


<pb n="18"/>



solved, agreeing to consider the rest of the question later. And now they are all on tiptoe with
eagerness to hear which of the orators will prevail
and be adjudged to set forth the truer cause.
Do you see the danger and the strait we are in,
since our cause stands or falls with a single man?
One of two things will happen: either we shall
be deemed mere names, and so of course disregarded, or else, if Timokles prove the better
speaker, we shall be honored as heretofore.
Hera. Really this is very dreadful, and you
were not so far wrong, Zeus, in addressing us in
tragic vein.
Zeus. And yet you thought it was some Danae
or Antiope that I was thinking about in such distress. Well, Hermes and Hera and Athene, what
would be best? Take your turns in helping me
to discover.
Hermes. I for my part say that an assembly
ought to be called for open discussion.
Hera. I think precisely as he does."
Athene. But it strikes me just the other way,
father. I do not think you ought to involve all
heaven in your embarrassment, or show your own
alarm at the affair; but make your arrangements
privately so that Timokles may triumph and
Damis be laughed out of court.
Hermes. But, Zeus, this course will not be unperceived, for the philosophers will hold their

tournament in public, and you will be accused of
Caesarism if you do not let all have a voice in
matters so weighty and common to all.
Zeus. Very well, then. Summon them at once
and let all appear. For you are right.
Hermes. Halloo, gods! Come to the assembly!
Do not loiter Gather, all of you! Come! We
are going to discuss great things!
Zeus. Hermes, is that bare, unadorned, prosaic
style of announcement the proper thing, particularly when the greatest matters are in question?
Hermes. Why, what do you think more proper,
Zeus?
Zeus. What do I think more proper? I say
you ought to make your summons impressive by
means of some sort of rhythm, and a sonorous,
poetic form, to bring them the more readily.
Hermes. Yes; but such things belong to versewriters and declaimers, Zeus, and I am the worst
poet imaginable. I should certainly ruin my summons by having too many feet in it or too few,
and they would laugh at the illiteracy of my composition. I see that even Apollo's verses in his
oracles are sometimes jeered at, though his prophecies are generally very obscure, so that those
who receive them have not much leisure to criticize the versification.
Zeus. Well, then, string a lot of Homer's verses


<pb n="20"/>



together in your summons, and convene us as he
used. Of course you remember them.
Hermes. I can't say that I have them very pat.
However, I will try :
Gods and goddesses all, let none fail to answer
my summons.
Let not a single nymph or river-god, save only
Ocean,
Tarry; but haste ye all to the council that Jove
hath appointed.
All are bidden who feast at the hecatomb's glorious banquet,
All, e'en of low degree, or lowest; yea, even the
nameless,
Seeing they too have a seat by the altars smoking with victims.
Zeus. Well done, Hermes. You could not have
summoned them better, and the proof is that they
are gathering already. So, receive them and seat
them according to the value of each in material
or workmanship; that is to say, the golden in the
seats of honor, next to these the silver ones, then
those of ivory, then those of bronze or stone; and
in this class preference is to be given to the works
of Pheidias and Alkamenes and Myron and Euphranor and artists of their rank. But thrust
these vulgar ones, the work of bunglers, together
on one side, and let them confine themselves to
silently making a quorum.


<pb n="21"/>

ZEUS THE TRAGEDIAN.
21
Hermes. Very well. They shall take their seats
in proper order. But I ought to know this: if
one of them is of gold or of great weight but not
well executed-in fact actually amateur's work
and out of drawing—is he to take his seat in front
of the bronzes of Myron and Polykleitos, and the
marbles of Pheidias and Alkamenes, or is preference to be given to workmanship?
Zeus. It ought to be; but, nevertheless, the gold
must take precedence.
Hermes. I see. Your orders are that they shall
take their seats in order of wealth rather than in
order of merit, in proportion to their taxable
property.
Come to the front seats, then, you golden ones!
It looks as though the barbarians would have the
front seats to themselves. The Greeks, at any
rate, are, as you see, graceful and goodly of aspect and shaped with skill, but they are all alike,
of wood or stone, except the very most valuable
of them, and they are ivory with something of
golden decoration. But they are merely colored and plated with it, and within they, too,
are wooden, and give shelter to whole droves of
mice who inhabit them. But Bendis here, and
Anoubis and Attis beside him, and Mithres and
Men are of solid gold, heavy, and really valuable.
Poseidon. Now, Hermes, is this just, to let this


<pb n="22"/>



dog-headed Egyptian take precedence of me,
Poseidon?
Hermes. No, Earthshaker; but, you see, Lysippos made you of bronze and poor because the
Corinthians had no gold at the time, and Anoubis
is whole mines richer than you. So you must e'en
put up with being shoved aside, and not lose your
temper if a god with such a great golden muzzle
as his has been preferred to you.
Aphrodite. Take me, too, then, Hermes, and
place me somewhere in the front rows, for I am
golden.
Hermes. Not as far as I can see, Aphrodite.
Unless I am exceedingly blear-eyed, you were
quarried out of the white stone of Pentele, and
then, at the good pleasure of Praxiteles, you became Aphrodite and were handed over to the
Knidians.
Aphrodite. But I will furnish you a trustworthy
referee in Homer, who, up and down in his poetry,
declares me "golden Aphrodite."
Hermes. Oh, Homer says that Apollo, too, is full
of gold and rich, but now you will see him sitting
somewhere in the worst seats, for the robbers
took his crown and stripped the pegs from his
lyre. So you may congratulate yourself that you
are not placed down among the servants.
Kolossos. I imagine that no one will venture to
vie with me, for I am Helios, and as you see for

size. For if the Rhodians had not seen fit to
make me abnormally large they could have made
sixteen golden gods for the same money. So I
ought to be considered proportionately rich. And
I exhibit art, too, and accurate workmanship, in
spite of my great stature.
Hermes. What is to be done, Zeus? This case,
too, is certainly a hard one to decide, for if I regard his material, he is bronze; but if I compute
how much money it cost to forge him, he ranks
above the highest class.
Zeus. Why need he be here, anyhow, to comment on the smallness of other people and give
trouble about his seat?


However, O mightiest of the Rhodians, even
you take rank never so much above the golden
gods, how could you take your seat before them
unless you ask them all to get up? If you were
to sit down you would fill the whole Pnyx. So
you would do better to stand during the meeting
and bend over the assembly.
Hermes. Here is another nice point to decide
between Dionysos here and Herakles. Both are
bronze; their workmanship is the same, for both
are by Lysippos; and, most vital point of all, they
are equals by birth, being alike sons of Zeus.
Which of them is to have precedence? They
are wrangling about it, as you see.
Zeus. We are wasting time, Hermes. We should


<pb n="24"/>



have got to business long ago. Let them sit down
now anyhow, each where he likes. By-and-by we
will hold an assembly to debate these questions,
and then I shall know how their ranks ought to
be assigned.
Hermes. Good heavens, what a din they make,
crying out, in plain every-day language, "Rations!" and "Where is the nectar?" and "The
ambrosia is giving out!" and "Where are the
hecatombs?" and "The sacrifices are common
property!"
Zeus. Call them to order, Hermes. Make them
stop this nonsense and hear why they were convened.
Hermes. But, Zeus, they do not all understand
Greek, and I am no polyglot to deliver an announcement to Scythians and Persians and Thracians and Celts all at once. I think I should do
best to enjoin silence by dumb show.
Zeus. Very well.
Hermes. There! Behold them reduced to the
silence of the sophists. Now is your time to address them. See, they are looking towards you
already, awaiting your speech.
Zeus. Hermes, you are my son, and I don't
mind telling you just how I feel. You know what
aplomb and magniloquence I have always shown
in our assemblies?
Hermes. Indeed I do. I was always frightened


<pb n="25"/>

ZEUS THE TRAGEDIAN.
25
when I heard you speak, particularly when you
would threaten to let down that golden rope and
drag from their foundations the earth and the sea
and the gods with them.
Zeus. But this time, my child, whether it is the
greatness of the impending dangers or of the audience-for the meeting is well attended, as you
see my presence of mind has utterly deserted
me, and I am trembling with nervousness and my
tongue seems tied. And, most absurd of all, I
have forgotten the opening of my speech, which
I had prepared with a view to making as agreeable a first impression as possible.
Hermes. You have spoiled everything. Your
silence is making them suspicious already, and
the more you delay the more overwhelmingly bad
news do they expect.
Zeus. Do you think, then, that I might begin
to recite to them that introduction of Homer's?
Hermes. What one?
Zeus. "Hearken now, ye gods, and every goddess, hearken."
Hermes. Stuff! You have recited those opening lines often enough in your cups already. But,
if you like, give up this tiresome business of poetry, and piece together any you choose of Demosthenes's orations against Philip, altering them a
little. That is the way most speaking is done
now, anyhow.


<pb n="26"/>



Zeus. That is a good idea-a sort of abridged
rhetoric or oratory made easy for the embarrassed.
Hermes. Well, are you never going to begin?
Zeus. I imagine, men of Olympus, that you
would gladly give considerable sums to obtain
an idea of what this matter may be with reference to which you are now summoned. This
being the case, you will do well to lend me your
ears with all eagerness. Now the present crisis,
deities, wellnigh declares, with audible voice, that
we must give all our energies to considering the
matters before us, but, as a matter of fact, we
seem to me to treat them with negligence. But
I should like-my Demosthenes fails me—to explain to you why I was so much disturbed as to
call an assembly. Yesterday, as you are aware,
Mnesitheos, the ship-master, offered a sacrifice
of thanksgiving for his ship that was almost lost
off Kaphereus, and we feasted in the Peiraieusas many of us, that is, as Mnesitheos had invited
to the banquet. After the libations you dispersed
in different directions, pursuing your own devices,
while I, seeing that it was not yet late, went up to
the city to stroll about at dusk in the Kerameikos,
pondering on the meanness of Mnesitheos. For
he offered up, by way of feast to sixteen gods,
one cock, aged and asthmatic at that, and four
grains of frankincense, pretty well decayed, so


<pb n="27"/>

ZEUS THE TRAGEDIAN.
27
that it went out immediately on the embers, and
not enough fragrance came out of the smoke to
tickle the tip of your nose. And yet when his
ship was actually going on the rocks and within.
the reef he promised whole hecatombs.
Well, revolving this in my mind, I turned up
near the Painted Porch, and there I saw a great
crowd of men gathered, some inside the porch
itself, but most of them in the open air, and some
were shouting, stretched out on the benches. I
guessed what was the case: that they were philosophers of the eristic order, and I determined
to stand by and listen to what they might say. I
happened to have a cloud wrapped round me—a
thick one-so I took on an exterior of their sort,
drew forth my beard, and presented no bad imitation of a philosopher. And so I elbowed my
way through the crowd and got inside without
being recognized, and I found a violent controversy going on between that fox Damis the Epicurean and Timokles the Stoic, the best of men.
Timokles was in a perspiration, and had lost his
voice already with screaming, and Damis was exasperating him still further by sardonic mockery.
Now, if you will believe it, their whole discussion was about us. Damis (confound him) declared that we have no forethought for men or
guardianship of their affairs, asserting that we do
not exist at all, for this was plainly the purport


<pb n="28"/>



of his speech. And some there were who applauded him. But the other, Timokles, took our
side and fought for us, and excited himself, and
did his best for us, praising our watchful care,
and rehearsing how all things are arranged and
reduced to regularity and order by us. He, too,
had some applause, but he had already been
speaking too long and his utterance was labored,
so that the crowd looked away from him to Damis. Seeing what was at stake, I bade the night
descend and break up the meeting, and so they
went their ways, agreeing to examine the question
completely the next day. I followed along with
the crowd, and heard them praising Damis's arguments among themselves as they walked home,
and already decidedly siding with him. But there
were some, too, who did not think it right to decide beforehand between the rivals, but to wait
and see what Timokles would say on the morrow.
These, deities, are my reasons for summoning
you; no slight ones, if you consider that all our
honor, revenue, and prestige come from men.
And if they should be persuaded either that we
do not exist at all or that we have no forethought
for them, we shall have no more sacrifices and
gifts and honor from earth, and we shall sit idly
in heaven oppressed by hunger when we are deprived of those feasts and national holidays and
games and sacrifices and vigils and processions.


<pb n="29"/>

ZEUS THE TRAGEDIAN.
29
In such a crisis we all ought certainly to devise
some means of safety by which Timokles may be
victorious and be held to make the truer argument, and Damis may be jeered by the audience.
For I myself have small confidence that Timokles
will win by his own exertions unless he also receives assistance from us. Accordingly, Hermes,
announce in due form that remarks are in order.
Hermes. Hear ye, silence! Make no disturbance! Who wishes to speak, of those full-grown
divinities whose right it is?
What is this? Does no one rise? They are all
silent, overwhelmed by the importance of the news.
Momos. "Now I would that you all might turn
to earth and to water!"
But for my part, Zeus, if I am at liberty to speak
with perfect freedom, I have a good many things
to say.
Zeus. Speak, Momos, without restraint. I am
sure your frankness will be for our good.
Momos. Hear, then, deities, what at any rate
I think in my heart of hearts, as they say. You
must know that I have been pretty confidently
expecting that our affairs would come to as bad a
pass as this, and that numbers of sophists like
these would spring up against us, finding grounds
for their temerity in our own conduct. By heaven, we have no right to be angry with Epicurus
or with his disciples and successors if they have


<pb n="30"/>



conceived these notions about us. What, then,
could you ask them to think when they see such
anarchy in human life, the best of them neglected,
perishing utterly in poverty and disease and slavery, while worthless blackguards are preferred
to them in honor, and surpass them in riches, and
are placed in authority over their betters; when
they see that sacrilege is not punished but escapes
unnoticed, while sometimes innocent men are impaled on stakes and beaten to death? It is only
natural, then, that when they see such things they
decide as they do, that we have no existence at
all, particularly when they hear the oracles saying
that if a certain man crosses the Halys he will
overthrow a great kingdom, without specifying
whether it will be his own kingdom or his enemy's. And then again the oracle says:
"Salamis, dear to the gods, thou shalt slay children of women."
But I imagine both the Persians and the Greeks
were children of women.
And then when they hear from the minstrels
how we fall in love, and receive wounds, and get
put in chains and made servants, and are divided
against ourselves, and have a myriad of troubles,
all the time claiming to be blessed and indestructible, have they not a perfect right to jeer at
us and make us of no account? But we get angry if certain persons who are human beings, and


<pb n="31"/>

ZEUS THE TRAGEDIAN.
31

not altogether devoid of wits, sift these matters
and deny our providence, whereas we ought to
felicitate ourselves if any still continue to sacrifice to sinners like us.
And now, Zeus, give me an honest answer to a
question-for we are alone, and there is no mortal
present in the assembly, except Herakles and Dionysos and Ganymedes and Asklepios, who have
somehow got naturalized among us—have you ever
paid enough attention to the people on earth to
distinguish the bad ones from the good? You
cannot say you have. Certainly, unless Theseus
on his
way from Troizen to Athens had incidentally exterminated those malefactors, Skeiron and
the Pine-Bender and Kerkyon and the others
might have continued to live riotously by the
slaughter of wayfarers, as far as you and your
providence are concerned. And if Eurystheus,
living in the earliest times and full of forethought,
had not been moved by philanthropy to inquire
into every one's affairs, and had not sent forth his
servant here, an active man and keen for labors,
you, Zeus, would have given small thought to the
Hydra and the Stymphalian birds and the Thrakian horses and the drunken insolence of the
Kentaurs. On the contrary, if I must speak
candidly, we sit and watch for just one thing,
whether haply some one is sacrificing and sending up the savor of burnt-offerings beside the


<pb n="32"/>



altars. Everything else drifts down stream as
chance carries it. Accordingly, our present experience is natural, and what we have yet in store
for us, too, when little by little mortals lift their
heads and find that it does them no good to offer
us sacrifices and pageants. Then you will soon
see your Epicurus and your Metrodoros and
your Damis jeering, and the speakers on our side
overcome and stopped by them. Not that Momos has much to lose if he falls into disrepute,
for I was never one of the reputable ones, even
while you were still prosperous and had a monopoly of the sacrifices.
Zeus. Do not mind this fellow's babble, deities,
for he was always an ill-conditioned fault-finder.
And, besides, in the words of the great Demosthenes, it is easy to criticise and blame and find
fault-any one who likes can do that; but it is
the gift of a truly sagacious counsellor to point
out how the state of things may be improved,
and this I am sure the rest of you will do, even if
Momos holds his tongue.
Poseidon. I, as you know, am generally under
water, and dwell by myself in the deep sea, doing
my best to rescue mariners and forward ships
and temper the winds. Nevertheless, I have a
stake in things up here, too, and it is my opinion
that this Damis ought to be disposed of before
he comes to the contest, either by lightning or


<pb n="33"/>

ZEUS THE TRAGEDIAN.
33
some other means, lest his speech prevail-for
you say, Zeus, that he is a plausible sort of fellow.
In that way we shall show them at the same time
that we take vengeance on people who say such
things against us.
Zeus. Are you joking, Poseidon, or have you
clean forgotten that we have nothing to do with
such matters, but that the Fates weave his death
for each man—for one by lightning, for another
by the sword, for a third by fever or consumption? Do you suppose that if this were under
my control I would have let those temple-robbers
go forth unstricken from Pisa the other day, when
they had cut off two locks of my hair weighing
six pounds each? Or would you yourself have
ignored the fisherman from Oreos who carried off
your trident at Geraistos? Above all, we should
seem to have lost self-control in our distress and
to be afraid of Damis's arguments, and therefore
to be getting rid of the man rather than to endure to confront him with Timokles. Should we
not in this way seem to be winning our case
merely by default ?
Poseidon. Now I thought I had hit on a short
cut to victory.
Zeus. Nonsense, Poseidon. Your argument is
worthy of one of your own tunny-fish, positively dense. Snatch away the opponent, forsooth, so that he may die unconquered and
3


<pb n="34"/>



leave his arguments behind without attack or
exposure!
Poseidon. Very well, think of something better
yourselves, if you dismiss my idea with a joke
about the tunnies.
Apollo. If it were permitted by law to a beardless youth like me to address the meeting, I could,
perhaps, make a useful contribution to the discussion.
Momos. In the first place, Apollo, the discussion has to do with such great questions that the
right of speech does not go by years, but is common to all. For it would be a nice thing if, when
we are in the extremest danger, we should quibble about a legal qualification. But, anyhow, you
are already decidedly eligible as a speaker in the
eye of the law, for you emerged long ago from
among the youths; you have been inscribed on
the rolls of the twelve, and you were almost a
member of the council in Kronos's day. So don't
try your youthful airs on us, but speak up boldly
and tell us your views. And do not let the fact
that you are a beardless orator embarrass you,
particularly when you have your son Asklepios
here with a beard to his waist. Moreover, it
would be peculiarly fitting for you to show your
wisdom now of all occasions, unless you have sat
philosophizing with the Muses on Helikon to no
purpose.


<pb n="35"/>

ZEUS THE TRAGEDIAN.

¦
Apollo. It is not your business, however, Momos, to give these permissions, but Zeus's, and if
he bids me I might perhaps say something worthy
of the Muses and my exercises on Helikon.
Zeus. Speak, my child; I give you leave.
Apollo. This Timokles is a worthy man and
pious, and perfectly conversant with the methods
of the Stoics, so that he teaches many young men
and levies no small fee therefor.
For he is very
convincing when he discourses with his pupils in
private; but he lacks nerve for public speaking,
and his utterance is untrained-half Greek and
half barbarian. On this account he always raises
a laugh in company, for he does not speak connectedly, but stammers and becomes confused,
most of all when, in spite of this weakness, he
wishes to exhibit elegance of style. His mind is
surpassingly sharp and quick-so they say who
are best informed in the doctrines of the Stoicsbut by his feebleness in speaking and expounding
he spoils his subject-matter and confuses it, and
fails to make his points clear, but rather lays down
enigmatical propositions; and when it is his turn
to answer expresses himself more darkly still.
So he is misunderstood and laughed at. Now
I think one should speak plainly, and take care
above everything that his hearers understand him.
Momos. What you say in praise of plain-speaking, Apollo, is very just, though you do not prac-


<pb n="36"/>



tice it very much yourself in your oracles. They
are ambiguous and enigmatical, and in a non-commital way throw most things on disputed ground,
so that the hearers need another Apollo to tell
them what you mean. But what is your advice
in this case? How is Timokles's weakness in argument to be cured?
Apollo. By furnishing him, if we can manage
it, with counsel: one of those clever men who
would deliver worthily whatever Timokles devised and suggested to him.
Momos. This is certainly a beardless utterance,
and still in want of a school-master! To set up
an advocate in an assemblage of philosophers to
expound Timokles's views to the company! Damis to be present in person, and speak in his own
character, but Timokles to use a mime and pour
whatever he thinks into his ear, and the actor to
deliver it, perhaps himself not understanding what
he hears! Of course it would be ridiculous to
the crowd. But let us consider this rather different idea. You say, my admirable friend, that
you are a seer, and you ask a good price for your
services, and once even received bricks of gold.
Why did you not give us an exhibition of your
skill in the nick of time by telling us which of
the Sophists is going to prevail in argument? For,
of course, you know what the issue will be, since
you are a seer.


<pb n="37"/>

ZEUS THE TRAGEDIAN.

Apollo. How can I, Momos, when I have no
tripod with me, and no incense and no prophetic
fountain like Kastalia?
Momos. Look, now, when you have got into a
tight place you run away from conviction.
Zeus. Never mind, my child. Speak out, and
do not give this backbiter pretexts for slander,
and for saying, in his sneering way, that your
skill is dependent on your tripod and your water
and your incense, and that unless you have these
your art will be lost.
Apollo. These things, father, are better done in
Delphi or in Kolophon, where I have all the accessories to which I am accustomed. Still, bare
as I am of these and unequipped, I will try to
prophesy which of them will have the mastery.
But you will bear with me if my verses should
nor be very correct.
Momos. Speak, but only make your remarks
clear, Apollo, so that they will not need an advocate themselves or interpretation. This is not a
case of sheep's flesh and tortoise being boiled together in Lydia. You know what our inquiry is
about.
Zeus. What in the world are you going to tell
us, my child? The symptoms that precede the
utterance are already alarming. His color is
fading, his eyes are rolling, his hair is standing
on end, and his gestures are those of a Ko-

rybant. His whole bearing is mystic, frantic,
possessed.
Apollo. Hear now the word divine, declared by
the prophet Apollo
Dealing with shuddering strife that men wage,
shrill with their screaming,
Armed cap-a-pie with words, with arguments wellcompacted.
Hither and yon with the clucking that shifts to
the side of the victor
Strike they and bear to earth the towering stern
of the plow-tail.
Yet, when the locust shall fall 'neath the crooked
claw of the vulture,
Then the rain - bringing crows shall utter their
ultimate portent.
Victory lies with the mules, but the ass shall butt
his fleet children.
Zeus. Why do you burst out laughing at this,
Momus? Surely there is nothing humorous in
our present situation. Stop, wretch, or you will
choke with laughing.
Momos. How can I help laughing at such a
clear, straightforward oracle?
Zeus. Then, perhaps, you will kindly interpret
to us what he says.
Momos. It is perfectly plain, so that we shall
not need Themistokles. The oracle says clearly
that the seer is a juggler and that we are pack-

asses, by Zeus! and mules to believe in him, with
not the wit of a locust among us.
Herakles. I do not hesitate, father, to express
my views, even though I am only a resident foreigner. My idea is that when they meet and are
already engaged in discussion, then, if Timokles
prove the better man, we will allow the meeting
to proceed to our advantage. But if it turn out
otherwise, then by your leave I will shake the
Porch itself from its foundations and hurl it at
Damis, so that the accursed wretch may not offer
insult to us.
Zeus. Heavens, Herakles, what a boorish speech,
and how horribly Boeotian! To destroy so many
for the sake of one wretch, and, what is more, the
Porch with Marathon, Miltiades, Kynaegeiros and
all? If all these should perish together, how
would the orators continue to practise, deprived
of the chief theme of their speeches? Moreover,
in your lifetime it was perhaps possible to do
even a thing of that kind; but since you have
become a god, you have learned, I presume, that
the Fates alone control these matters, and we
have no voice in them.
Herakles. Then, when I was slaying the lion
or the hydra, the Fates were doing these things
by my agency?
Zeus. Certainly.
Herakles. And at this moment if any one uses


<pb n="40"/>



insolence towards me, by rifling one of my temples or overturning my statue, shall I not destroy
him unless it was long ago so decided by the
Fates?
Zeus. By no means.
Herakles. Then, Zeus, hear me declare myself
frankly, for I am a boor, as the comic poet said,
and I call a spade a spade. If this is our plight,
I shall bid a long farewell to the worship and
savor of burnt-offerings and blood of victims in
heaven, and go off to Hades. There the ghosts,
at least, of the beasts I slew will be afraid of me,
if I have my bow, though I be unarmed beside.
Zeus. Very well; nothing like a relative for
turning state's evidence, as they say. You would
have saved Damis the trouble of making these
remarks by suggesting them yourself.
But who is this hasty - comer-bronze, wellformed, with a good outline and an obsolete coiffure? It must be your brother, Hermes, the one
that stands in the market-place near the Porch.
At all events, his hollows are full of pitch from
having impressions of him taken daily by the
statuaries.
Why, my child, do you come to us at racing
speed? Have you, perhaps, some fresh news
from earth?
Hermagoras. Great news, Zeus, and calling for
the greatest attention.


<pb n="41"/>

ZEUS THE TRAGEDIAN.
4I
Zeus. Speak, then, if some new trouble has
arisen unknown to us.
Hermagoras. It chanced that even now the
brass-workers
Were smearing me with pitch on breast and back.
A breastplate modelled by the mimic's art
Hung round me ludicrous. It was beat out
Merely to take th' impression of my bronze.
But I beheld a crowd approaching. Two
Pale, screaming, quibbling, verbal prize-fighters,
One Damis and the other-
Zeus. Drop the iambics, there's a good fellow.
I know whom you mean. But tell me this, whether
they have already joined battle.
Hermagoras. Not yet. They were still skirmishing and attacking each other from afar with
the javelins of abuse.
Zeus. What is there left for us to do now,
deities, but bend down and listen to them? So
let the Hours draw the bolt immediately and
chase away the clouds and throw open the gates
of heaven.
Heavens, what a crowd has gathered to hear
them! But I am not very well satisfied with
Timokles himself; he is trembling with confusion. He will ruin everything this day. Evidently he will not be able to stand against Damis. However, let us do what in us lies and
pray for him.


<pb n="42"/>



"Silence on our side, that Damis, at least, may
not hear us."
Timokles. What is this you say, Damis, you
looter of temples? That the gods do not exist
or exercise providence for men?
Damis. That is what I say; but do you first
answer me, and state what reason you have for
believing in their existence.
Timokles. I will not, you wretch. You answer me.
Damis. I will not. Answer yourself.
Zeus. So far our man has been far more successfully and loudly abusive. That's right, Timokles, pour on the abuse. Your strength lies
there, since in other lines he stops your mouth
and makes you dumb as a fish.
Timokles. By Heaven, I will not answer you first
if I know it.
Damis. Then put your question, for you beat
me that time by swearing. But spare abusive
language, if you please.
Timokles. Very well. Tell me, then, is it your
opinion, accursed wretch, that the gods exert no
providence?
Damis. They do not.
Timokles. What, is the universe, then, not the
result of design?
Damis. It is not.
Timokles. And did no god arrange the whole
superintendence of things either?
---


<pb n="43"/>

ZEUS THE TRAGEDIAN.
43
Damis. No.
Timokles. But all things are borne along haphazard by an unreasoning current?
Damis. Yes.
Timokles. Now can you men endure to hear
this and not stone the guilty wretch?
Damis. Why do you stir up the audience against
me, Timokles? And who are you to show anger
in the gods' behalf when they are not angry themselves? At least they have not handled me
roughly, though they have heard me for a long
time, supposing they do hear.
Timokles. They hear, Damis, they hear, and
they will take vengeance on you some day.
Damis. And when would they have leisure for
my case if, as you say, they are full of cares,
managing the universe, infinite as it is? That is
the reason they have not yet even punished you
for your continual perjuries and your other crimes,
which I will not specify lest I should be driven
to use abusive language myself, contrary to our
agreement. And yet I do not see how they could
produce better proof of their own providence than
by bringing your bad life to a bad end. But
clearly they have gone abroad, across the ocean,
perchance to visit the "blameless Ethiopians."
At least it is their habit to go constantly to dine
with them, and sometimes on their own invitation.


<pb n="44"/>



Timokles. What shall I say in reply to such
shameless effrontery?
Damis. What I have been yearning to hear
from you this long time: how you came to believe
in the providence of the gods.
Timokles. I was convinced of it first by the
order of natural events: the sun who always travels the same road and the moon similarly, and
the recurring seasons, and the growth of plants,
and the birth of animals, and these animals themselves so ingeniously contrived that they feed
themselves and reason, and move about and walk,
and build houses and make shoes, and all the
rest of it. Do not these seem to you the works
of providence?
Damis. Why, Timokles, you have assumed the
very question in dispute, for it remains to be seen.
whether each of these is accomplished by providence. That natural events are such as you describe I, too, admit, but it does not follow of
necessity that they owe their existence to any intelligent foresight. For it is possible that they
had some other origin, and yet have now a consistent and methodical existence. But this forced
action of theirs you call 'order,' and then, forsooth, you fly into a rage if some one rejects your
argument when, after recounting and praising the
nature of objects, you go on to believe that this
is a proof that each of them is also put in its


<pb n="45"/>

ZEUS THE TRAGEDIAN.
45
place by providence. Wherefore, in the words
of the comic poet,
"This is too feeble, tell me something else."
Timokles. For my part, I do not think that additional proof is necessary; but still I will go on.
Answer me, do you consider Homer the best of
poets?
Damis. Certainly.
Timokles. Well, he convinced me by setting
forth the providence of the gods.
Damis. But, my astonishing friend, every one
will grant you that Homer is a great poet, but not
that he or any poet whatsoever is a reliable witness in these matters. For their concern, I imagine, is not for truth, but to charm their hearers;
and on this account they lull us with metres and
amuse us with stories, and devise the whole thing
in the interests of pleasure. Still, I should be
pleased to hear what passages of Homer chiefly
convinced you. Probably those in which he
speaks of Zeus, and tells how his daughter and
his brother and his wife plotted to put him in
irons. And if Thetis had not perceived what was
going on and called Briareos, our glorious Zeus
would have been seized and tied up. It was in
return for this and to repay his obligation to Thetis that he deceived Agamemnon by sending him
a false dream for the destruction of many Greeks.
Notice that he was unable to launch a thunder-


<pb n="46"/>



bolt and burn up Agamemnon himself, but must
assume the role of cheat. Or was conviction forced
upon you chiefly when you heard how Diomedes
wounded Aphrodite and then Ares himself at the
suggestion of Athene, and how the gods themselves
fell to after a little and fought duels indiscriminately, gods and goddesses together, and how Athene
overcame Ares because, I imagine, he was weak from
the wound he had already got from Diomedes, and
"Hermes, the ready-helper, stoutly stood against
Leto?"
Or did the account of Artemis strike you as convincing, telling how her discontented nature was
angered because Oineus did not ask her to his
banquet, and how, accordingly, she let loose upon
his land a certain boar of surpassing size and irresistible strength? Was it, then, by such narratives as these that Homer convinced you?
Zeus. Alas, alack! What an outcry the crowd
made, deities, applauding Damis! And our man
seems to have lost his head. He is frightened,
certainly, and trembling, and on the point of throwing away his shield. He is already looking about
for some loop-hole through which he can slip and
make his escape.
Timokles. Perhaps you do not think that Euripides says anything sound, either, when he introduces the gods themselves upon the stage and
shows them engaged in saving the good among


<pb n="47"/>

ZEUS THE TRAGEDIAN.
47
the heroes, but destroying the wicked and impiety
like yours?
Damis. But, most illustrious of philosophers, if
the dramatists have convinced you by such means
as that, one of two things follows. Either you
believe the actors to be for the moment gods, or
else the divine masks themselves, and the shoes,
and the tunics flowing to the feet, and the cloaks,
and the loose sleeves, and the false paunches, and
the padding, and all the rest of the apparatus
which makes the tragedy impressive, which is
most ridiculous, I think. But whenever Euripides
speaks his own mind, unforced by the exigencies
of the dramas, hear how bold he is:
"You see this boundless aether spread on high,
Enfolding earth in damp, encircling arms?
Deem then that this is Zeus, believe this god."
and again,
"Zeus,
Whoe'er Zeus is, for I know not, unless
By hearsay,"
and other similar passages.
Timokles. Then all mankind and the nations
have been deceived in believing in the gods and
celebrating their feasts?
Damis. It is a good thing, Timokles, that you
reminded me of the religious opinions among the
nations, the very things which best show that
there is no certainty about gods. For there is


<pb n="48"/>



much confusion, and different races have different
faiths. The Scythians worship a sword; the
Thracians, Zamolxis, a fugitive who came to them
from Samos; the Phrygians, Mena; the Ethiopians,
Day; the Assyrians, a dove; the Persians, fire; the
Egyptians, water. Moreover, while this waterworship is common to all the Egyptians, the peculiar god of the people of Memphis is the bull,
and that of the Pelusians is the onion; and others
worship the ibis or the crocodile, and others a
dog-headed creature or a cat or an ape. And,
again, the rural communities differ from one another, so that some men hold the right shoulder
to be a god, but those that dwell opposite to them
the left. And some worship one side of the head,
and others an earthen wine-cup or a bowl. Are
not these things absurd, friend Timokles?
Momos. Did I not tell you, deities, that all
these things would come to light and be rigorously
investigated?
Zeus. You did, Momos, and your censure was
just; and if we escape this present danger, I for
one will try to straighten out these matters.
Timokles. But tell me, god-forsaken wretch,
whose work would you call oracles and prophecies
of future events, if not of the gods and their
providence?
Damis. Hold your peace, my good fellow, on
the subject of the oracles, for I shall ask you


<pb n="49"/>

ZEUS THE TRAGEDIAN.
49
which of them in particular you would like to recall. Perhaps that one Apollo delivered to the
Lydian, which was neatly double-edged and looked both ways, like some of the Hermae, which are
exactly alike on both sides to whichever part of
them you look. For tell me, will Croesus by
crossing the Halys be more likely to overthrow
his own kingdom or that of Cyros? And yet
that Sardian pest paid no small sum for this reversible utterance.
Momos. The man is enumerating the very
things I was most afraid of. Where now is our
handsome harper? Go down and defend yourself against these charges of his.
Zeus. You strike us when we are down, Momos,
finding fault with us now, when the season is past.
Timokles. Beware what you are doing, wretched
Damis. You are all but overturning the very
seats and altars of the gods with your arguments.
Damis. No, not all their altars, Timokles; for
what harm do they do if they are full of incense
and fragrance? But those of Artemis in Tauris
I should be delighted to see turned upsidedown,
whereon the maiden goddess feasts joyously on
the things we wot of.
Zeus. Whence has this overwhelming evil come
upon us?
There is not a divinity that the man
stands in awe of. He speaks his mind as freely
as a wench in a procession, and he
4


<pb n="50"/>



"Grasps them all in order, deserving and undeserving."
Momos. In truth, Zeus, you would find very few
who do not deserve it among us. And surely the
man will go on to lay hold of even the very greatest.
Timokles. Perhaps you do not hear Zeus thundering, you fighter against the gods?
Damis. Of course I hear the thunder; but as
to whether it is Zeus who thunders, your knowledge would be more reliable if you had come
from somewhere up there among the gods. For
travellers from Crete tell us a different story:
that a certain tomb is shown in that country, and
beside it stands a pillar telling that Zeus will
thunder no more, being long since dead.
Momos. I knew long ago that the man was
going to say that. But, Zeus, why have you turned
pale? Why do you tremble so that your teeth
chatter? You must take heart and despise such
manikins.
Zeus. What do you say, Momos? Despise
them? Do you not see how large the audience
is, and how they are persuaded against us already,
and how Damis is leading them away with their
ears stopped?
Momos. But, Zeus, if you liked you could let
down a rope and
"Drag not them alone, but earth, too, and the
ocean."


<pb n="51"/>

ZEUS THE TRAGEDIAN.
51
Timokles. Tell me, wretch, have
at sea?
you ever been
Damis. Yes, often.
Timokles. You were carried along then, were
you not, either by the wind striking the main-sail
and filling the staysail, or by the rowers, while
some one person stood at the helm and brought
the vessel through in safety?
Damis. Certainly.
Timokles. Then the ship could not sail unless
it was steered; but you imagine that this universe
moves along without pilot or guide?
Zeus. Well done, Timokles! that is a powerful
comparison.
Damis. But, Timokles, darling of the gods, you
would have seen that our pilot was always devising something to our advantage and making his
arrangements at the proper time, and giving his
commands to the sailors in good season, and that
there was nothing useless or foolish about the
ship. On the contrary, everything was altogether
useful and necessary to their management of her.
But this pilot of yours, whom you suppose to
stand at the helm of this great ship, and his crew,
do not order a single thing sensibly or as it ought
to be. The forestay is hauled aft if it so happens,
and the sheets forward. Sometimes the anchors
are of gold, while the stern is ornamented with
lead. Under water the ship's lines are good, but


<pb n="52"/>



above the water-line she is shapeless. And
among the sailors themselves you will find that
one who is lazy, unskilled, and afraid of his duties
draws double or treble pay, while another, who is
an expert swimmer and quick to spring to the
yards, and who knows the best thing to do in
every case, this man is set simply to bale out
bilge-water. You will find the same sort of thing
among the passengers, too. A worthless rascal
occupies the place of honor next the captain, and
receives attention. Another, an indecent fellow,
or a parricide, or a temple-robber, is honored
above others, and has taken possession of the upper deck, while many men of culture are penned
together in a corner of the vessel and trodden
underfoot by those who are really their inferiors.
At any rate, you remarked how Sokrates made
the voyage, and Aristeides and Phokion, without
either daily bread enough or room to stretch their
legs on the bare deck along the hold, and on the
other hand how well Kallias and Meidias and
Sardanapalos fared in their overweening luxury,
spitting on those beneath. This is the sort of
thing that goes on in your ship, sage Timokles,
wherefore the shipwrecks are countless. But if
any pilot stood at the helm, and kept a lookout
and ordered everything, he would know in the
first place who were good and who were worthless
of the ship's company, and he would apportion to


<pb n="53"/>

ZEUS THE TRAGEDIAN.
53
each what befitted his merits, giving the better
quarters near himself on deck to the better men,
and the lower parts to the worse, and he would
cause some of the better sort to sit at table together and come to terms of confidence. Among
the sailors a zealous man would be distinguished
by being put on the lookout or made captain of a
watch, or set over all the others. But a lazy shirk
would get the rope's end about his head five times
a day. So, my friend, your comparison seems to
have capsized because it fell into the hands of a
bad pilot.
Momos. Things are running with the tide for
Damis now, and he is sailing to victory with a
fair wind.
Zeus. Your metaphor is just, Momos, and Timokles invents no forcible argument. He only la-
Idles out easily refuted commonplaces one after
another that are in every one's mouth.
Timokles. Well, since you do not think the analogy of the ship very forcible, listen while I cast
the last blessed anchor I have, which you will not
drag by any device.
Zeus. What in the world is he going to say?
Timokles. For see now whether my syllogism is
fallacious, and whether you can possibly overturn
it. If altars exist, gods exist also. But altars
certainly exist, therefore gods exist also. What
have you to say to that?


<pb n="54"/>



Damis. Let me have my laugh out first and
then I will answer you.
Timokles. But it looks as if you would never be
done laughing. However, tell me why my speech
struck you as ridiculous.
Damis. Because you do not perceive that you
have slung your anchor on a slender thread,
though it is the last blessed one you have. For
when you have made fast the proposition "gods.
exist" to the proposition "altars exist" you imagine that you have brought it to a safe anchorage.
So since you have nothing more blessed to urge
let us adjourn at once.
Timokles. Do you then admit yourself worsted
by crying" Enough?"
Damis. Yes, Timokles, for you, like a hardpressed fugitive, have taken sanctuary on your
altars, and so, by the blessed anchor, I long
to swear a truce with you on these very altars, so that we may no longer wrangle about
them.
Timokles. You are chaffing me, you grave-robber, you blackguard, you disgusting beast, you
knavish slave, you refuse! Don't I know who
your father was and your mother, too, and how
you strangled your brother, and are an evil-liver
and corrupter of lads, you filthy, shameless wretch?
Don't run away now, for you are going to get
blows from me, too, before you get off. I am go-


<pb n="55"/>

ZEUS THE TRAGEDIAN.
55
ing to cut your throat directly with this potsherd,
miscreant that you are!
Zeus. Damis is running off laughing, deities,
and the other is chasing him with abuse, put out
past bearing by Damis's wealth of impertinence,
and apparently he is going to clip him in the head
with the tile. But what shall we do now?
Hermes. It seems to me the comic poet was
right when he said:
"Do not profess defeat and you will suffer none."
For what great harm is it if a handful of men
go off persuaded to these views, seeing that there
are many who know to the contrary, the majority of the Greeks, a numerous race, and all the
barbarians?
Zeus. However, Hermes, that was a capital remark that Dareios made about Zopyrus. In the
same way I, too, would rather have one Damis for
my ally than rule ten thousand Babylons.

Buyer. He is not bad to look at, but just what
does he know?
Hermes. Arithmetic, astronomy, magic, geometry, music, jugglery. A finished fortune-teller is
before you.
Buyer. May one question him?
Hermes. With all my heart.
Buyer. What country are you of?
Pythagoras. Samos.
Buyer. Where were you educated?
Pythagoras. In Egypt, among the sages there.
Buyer. Well, then, if I buy you what will you
teach me?
Pythagoras. I will not teach you anything. I
will remind you.
Buyer. How will you remind me?
Pythagoras. By first making your soul clean,
and washing off the filth that is on it.
Buyer. Now, suppose me already purified, what
is your method of reminding?
Pythagoras. The first step is a long, speechless
silence; you must not say a word for five whole

But I am a talker with no desire to become a

Pythagoras. Practise in music and geometry.
Buyer. That is a nice statement ! If I am to
become a philosopher I must first learn to play
the harp!
Pythagoras. In addition to these, counting.
Buyer. I can count now.
Pythagoras. How do you do it?
Buyer. One, two, three, four.
Pythagoras. Look, now; what you deem four is
really ten, and a perfect triangle, and what we
swear by.
Buyer. Hear me swear a mighty oath: by Four,
I never heard diviner or more holy words.
Pythagoras. And after that, stranger, you will
have knowledge concerning earth and air and
water and fire-the mass of each, and what form
it has, and what motion by consequence.
Buyer. Then has fire form, or air, or water?
Pythagoras. Very clear forms, for the formless
and shapeless is immovable; and besides these
things you will know that God is number and
mind and harmony.
Buyer. This is startling!
Pythagoras. Beyond what I have already said,
you will know that you yourself, who seem to be
a unit, are one person in appearance and another
in reality.
Buyer. What do you say? Am I somebody
else and not this person now talking to you?

Pythagoras. Now you are he, but formerly you
appeared in another body and with another name;
and in time you will change again into another.
Buyer. You mean this: that I shall be immortal, changing into one form after another?
But that is enough on this subject. What are
your habits of life?
Pythagoras. I touch no sort of animal food, but
anything else except beans.
Buyer. What is the reason of that? Perhaps
you dislike beans?
Pythagoras. Not at all, but they are sacred and
of a marvellous nature. But, what is more important, it is the custom of the Athenians to vote for
officers with beans.
Buyer. All your remarks are lofty and priestlike. But take off your clothes and let me see
you stripped. Good heavens, his thigh is golden! He seems to be a god, not a mortal. I will

Hermes. Two hundred dollars.
Buyer. I will take him at the price.
Zeus. Make a note of the buyer's name and
country.

Buyer. Then are you not afraid he will sue you
for kidnapping, and bring you before the criminal

Hermes. Ask the man himself; that is the better way.
Buyer. I am afraid of him, with his sullen, dark

Diogones. You see before you a citizen of the
world.
Buyer. And who is
Diogones. Herakles.
your model?
Buyer. Then why don't you wear the lion-skin,
too? You are like him as far as the club goes.
Diogones. This is my lion-skin, my threadbare
coat. Like him, I make war on pleasures; not
under orders, but of my own will, deliberately
choosing to purify life.
Buyer. A noble choice! But just what are we
to understand that you know? What art are you
master of?
Diogones. I am the liberator of mankind and
the physician of their passions; but, above all, I
wish to be the prophet of truth and free speech.
Buyer. Come, prophet, if I buy you, what training will you put me through?
Diogones. First, I will take you in hand and strip
you of your luxury, locking you up with poverty

and clothing you in a threadbare cloak. Next, I
will drive you to travail and toil, with the ground
for your bed, water for your drink, and for your
food whatever comes along. As for your money,
if you have any, you will carry
it down to the sea
and throw it in, if you will be guided by me, and
you will have no care for wife or child or fatherland; everything of that sort will seem trumpery
to you. You will leave your paternal house, and
take up your dwelling in a tomb, or in a deserted
tower, or even in a tub. Let your wallet be full
of pease and bescribbled books, and in this plight
you will declare yourself happier than the great
king. If any one should flog you or stretch you
on the rack you will feel no pain.
Buyer. What do you mean by that feeling no
pain when one is flogged? I have not got the
covering of a turtle or a lobster on my shoulders!
Diogones. You will admire that little saying of
Euripides, with a word or two altered.
Buyer. What one?
Diogones. Your heart will suffer, but your tongue
will feel no pain. But the most necessary qualities are these: you must be reckless and daring,
and abuse all alike, kings and subjects. By this
means you will be noticed and thought manly.
Let your speech be uncouth, your voice discordant and strongly resembling a dog's. Wear a
strenuous face, and choose a gait in keeping with

it; and let all your ways be wild and boorish.
But let shame and reason and moderation stand
afar off, and strip your blushes from your cheeks
altogether. Haunt the most frequented spots,
and even in those let your desire be for unshared
solitude; and attach yourself to neither friend nor
stranger, for that would upset your empire. And
at last, if you see fit, eat a raw polyp or a jelly-fish,
and die. Such is the happiness we procure for you.
Buyer. Be off with you! Your ways are foul
and unnatural.
Diogones. But the easiest, at least, sirrah, and
handy for every one to pursue; for they will not
ask education of you, or oratory, or nonsense.
No; this road is a short cut to fame; for even if
you are a private citizen, a tanner, or a fishmonger, or a carpenter, or a cabinet-maker, nothing prevents your being a wonder if only you are
shameless and bold, and have acquired the art of
skilful abuse.
Buyer. I do not want your services in that line,
but you might perhaps be convenient as a sailor
or a gardener-particularly if the vendor is willing to sell you for not more than five cents.
Hermes. Take him; we shall be glad to get rid
of him. He is a nuisance, yelling and abusing
everybody generally with his foul tongue.
Zeus. Call another, the Cyrenaic, the one in the
purple robe with the garland on his head.

Hermes. Come now, attention, all! This article is expensive, and only for the rich. This is
a life of sweetness, a thrice-blessed life! Who
wants luxury? Who will buy the daintiest thing
going?
Buyer. Step forward, you, and tell me what you
happen to know. I will buy you if you are useful.
Hermes. Do not annoy him, my good fellow, or
ask him questions. He is drunk and cannot answer you, for his tongue is thick, as you perceive.
Buyer. And who in his senses would buy such
an abandoned, dissipated slave? How he reeks
of perfumes, and how reeling and uncertain his
gait is! But tell me yourself, Hermes, if need be,
what his points are, and what his pursuits.
Hermes. Primarily he is a clever man to live
with you, able to drink with you, and just the
man to go with a flute-girl on the revels of an
amorous and spendthrift master. Moreover, he
is a connoisseur of made dishes, a most experienced cook, and a complete professor of the art
of pleasant living. In fact, he was educated at
Athens, and also served various despots in Sicily,
and is highly esteemed by them. This is the substance of his principles: to despise everything,
make use of everything, and gather pleasure from
every source.
Buyer. You had better cast your eye on some


<pb n="68"/>



one of these rich men with full purses. Certainly
for buying a gay life I am not your man.
Hermes. It looks, Zeus, as though this one would
be left on your hands.
Zeus. Set him aside and put up another. These
two, for choice, the laugher from Abdera and the
weeper from Ephesus, for I should like to sell the
two together.
Hermes. Let them come down into full view.
I offer the noblest lives; we announce the sagest
of all!
Buyer. Heavens, what a contrast! The one
never stops laughing, and the other seems to be
in grief for somebody. He is consumed with
weeping.
What is the matter, fellow?
laughing?
Why are you
Demokritos. What a question! Because all your
doings and you yourselves strike me as so
funny!
Buyer. What? You are laughing at us all, and
don't take our doings seriously?
Demokritos. Even so, for there is nothing serious in them. They are all empty, a whirl of
atoms, the infinite.
Buyer. By no means; it is you that are really
empty and infinitesimal. What impudence! Will
you not stop laughing?
But what are you weeping for, my good fellow?


<pb n="69"/>

I imagine it will be much pleasanter to talk with
you.
Herakleitos. Because, friend, I deem human life
a lamentable thing, worthy of tears, so soon passeth it all away. Therefore, I pity you and bewail
your lot. The present does not strike me as important, and what is to come hereafter is unmixed
woe-I mean the final conflagration and the catastrophe of the universe. These are the things I
lament. Nothing is steadfast, but all things are
somehow pressed together into an olla-podrïda
and the same thing is a joyless joy, a knowing
without knowledge, a great littleness, drifting up
and down and changing at the caprice of the
playful Aeon.
Buyer. What may the Aeon be?
Herakleitos. A child at play, moving the chessmen, changing them by hazard.
Buyer. What, then, are men?
Herakleitos. Mortal gods.
Buyer. And what are the gods?
Herakleitos. Immortal men.
Buyer. Are you talking in riddles, fellow, or
setting me conundrums? You make your meaning as dim, actually, as Apollo does.
Herakleitos. Because I am at no pains about
you.
Buyer. Very well; neither will any but a lunatic
buy you.


<pb n="70"/>



Herakleitos. I bid each of you go to the devil
from his youth up, whether he purchase or purchase not.
Buyer. His affliction is not much removed from
melancholia. For my part, I am not going to buy
either of them.
Hermes. These two are left on our hands.
Zeus. Put up another!
Hermes. That Athenian there, the chatterbox?
Zeus. By all means.
Hermes. Come here, you! We offer a good,
sensible life. Who buys the most holy?
Buyer. Tell me, just what do you happen to
know?
Sokrates. I am a lover and wise in the science
of love.
Buyer. Then how in the world could I buy
you? For what I want is a tutor for my pretty
boy.
Sokrates. Well, who could be a better man than
I to associate with the fair? It is beautiful souls
that I love, not bodies. Indeed, I swear it to you
by the dog and the plane-tree.
Don't you
Buyer. Heavens, what strange gods!
Sokrates. What's that you say?
think the dog is a god? Perhaps you have not
noticed how great Anoubis is in Egypt, and
Seirios in the heavens, and Kerberos among the
dead.


<pb n="71"/>

Buyer. You are right, it was my mistake. But
what is your manner of life?
Sokrates. I live by myself in a sort of state that
I fashioned with a foreign form of government,
and I enact my own laws.
Buyer. I should like to hear one of your principles.
Sokrates. Well, this is the most important: my
decision about women. No woman is assigned
to one man alone, but to every one who wishes
her in marriage.
Have you, then, abrogated the
Buyer. What!
laws about marriage?
Sokrates. Dear me, yes, and all such petty formalities. Beauty shall be the reward of the bravest-those who have accomplished some brilliant
feat of daring.
Buyer. A fine reward! And what is the substance of your philosophy?
Sokrates. The ideas and the types of existing
things; for, indeed, everything that you see-the
earth and all upon it, the sky, the sea-all these
things have invisible images outside the universe.
Buyer. Where are they?
Sokrates. Nowhere; for if they were anywhere
they could not be.
Buyer. I don't see these types you speak of.
Sokrates. Naturally; for your soul's eye is blind.


<pb n="72"/>



But I see the images of all things: an invisible
you, another me, and everything double.
Buyer. Then you will do to buy, for you are
wise and have good eyes.
Come, Hermes, how much will you charge me
for him?
Hermes. Two thousand dollars.
Buyer. I take him at the price. However, I
will pay you later.
Hermes. What is your name?
Buyer. Dion of Syracuse.
Hermes. Take him, with my best wishes.
Next I call you, the Epicurean. Who will buy
this one? He is the pupil of that laugher and of
the drunkard whom I offered a little while ago.
But he has made one step in advance of them, inasmuch as he has less regard for holy things.
For the rest, he is pleasant and the friend of good
living.
Buyer. What's the price?
Hermes. Forty dollars.
Buyer. Here you are. But tell me what sort
of food he likes.
Hermes. He lives on sweet things like honey,
and particularly figs.
Buyer. That is easy enough. I will buy him
penny-loaves of fig-cake.
Zeus. Call up another-that scowling fellow
with the shaved head from the Porch.


<pb n="73"/>

Hermes. Very well. At all events, a great crowd
of those who have come to the sale seem to be
waiting for him. I offer for sale virtue herself,
the most perfect of lives. Who wishes to know
everything, alone of all men?
Buyer. What do you mean?
Hermes. This man alone is wise, he alone is
beautiful, he alone is just, manly, a king, an orator, a millionaire, a legislator, and everything else.
Buyer. Then, friend, is he alone a cook, and a
tanner, by Jove! and a carpenter, and everything
of that sort?
Hermes. Apparently.
Buyer. Come, my friend, and tell me, your purchaser, what sort of person you are, and, to begin
with, whether it is not an affliction to you to be
sold and in slavery.
Chrysippos. Not at all; for those things are not
under our control, and what is not under our control is therefore indifferent.
Buyer. I don't understand just what you mean.
Chrysippos. What, do you not understand that
in such matters some things are preferred and
some again rejected?
Buyer. I don't understand even yet.
Chrysippos. Naturally, for you are not accustomed to our terminology, nor have you the perceptive imagination. But the virtuous man, he
who has mastered logical theory, knows not only


<pb n="74"/>



these things, but also the nature of an accident
and a secondary accident, and how much difference there is between them.
Buyer. In the name of wisdom, kindly take the
trouble to tell me this, too: what accidents and
secondary accidents are. I am indescribably impressed by the roll of the words.
Chrysippos. No trouble at all. If a lame man,
stumbling with that lame foot itself against a
stone gets unexpectedly hurt, this man's lameness is evidently a primary accident to which
he adds a secondary accident in the way of the
wound.
What else, now, do you
Buyer. How clever!
claim to know?
Chrysippos. The meshes of argument wherewith
I trip up my interlocutors and block their passage
and reduce them to silence by actually muzzling
them. The name of this faculty is the famous
syllogism.
Buyer. By Herkules, it is an irresistible, mighty
weapon, from your description.
Chrysippos. I will give you a specimen. Have
you a child?
Buyer. Certainly.
Chrysippos. If a crocodile should manage to
snatch it, finding it wandering too near the river,
and if, then, he should promise to restore it if you
could tell him truly whether he had determined


<pb n="75"/>

THE SALE OF LIVES.
75
to give it back or not, what would you tell him
he had in mind?
Buyer. That is a difficult question, for I do not
see which answer would be the more likely to get
the child back. But do you, in Heaven's name,
answer for me, and save my child before he eats
him.
Chrysippos. Never fear, I will teach you other
things still more surprising.
Buyer. What sort of things?
Chrysippos. The Reaper, the Master, and, above
all, the Elektra, and the Veiled.
Buyer. What do you mean by the "Veiled," or
the "Elektra ?"
Chrysippos. Elektra is that famous person, the
daughter of Agamemnon, who at the same moment knows a thing and does not know it; for
when Orestes stands beside her, still incognito,
she knows, indeed, that Orestes is her brother,
but that this is Orestes she does not know. And
I will tell you about the "Veiled," too, a most extraordinary figure. Answer me, do you know your
father?
Buyer. Yes.
Chrysippos. Well, then, if I present some veiled
person to you and ask whether you know him,
what would you say?
Buyer. That I do not, of course.
Chrysippos. And yet this very person was your


<pb n="76"/>



father! Therefore, if you do not know him, it is
plain you do not know your father.
Buyer. Not at all, for if I unveil him I shall
know the truth. However, what is the object of
your philosophy? What do you do when you
have reached the pinnacle of virtue?
Chrysippos. I shall then be occupied with the
first things in the order of nature-riches, I mean,
and health, and such like things. But before
that one must needs toil much, sharpening his
sight on books in fine print, taking notes, and filling himself with solecisms aand uncouth phrases.
Most important of all, it is not permitted to become a sage until you have drunk hellebore three
times in succession.
Buyer. This is all very noble in you and extremely manly. But what are we to say when a
man, who has already drunk the hellebore and arrived at virtue, turns money - lender at fifty per
cent., for I see this belongs to your principles too?
Chrysippos. By all means. The sage is the only
man fit to lend money; for since ratiocination
is his peculiar function, and calculating ratios and
per cents. seems to be the next thing to ratiocinating, it follows from these premises that the
special business of the good man alone is to get
not only simple interest like other people, but
compound. For you know there are two sorts of
interest, one sort coming first, and the other sec-


<pb n="77"/>
77
ond, as it were the offspring of the first, and of
course you see what the syllogism has to say
about it if he gets the simple interest, he will
also get the compound, but he does get the simple interest, therefore he will also get the compound.
Buyer. And must we say the same of the fees
you take for imparting your wisdom to young
men? Is it clear that the good man alone will
make money out of his virtue?
Chrysippos. You grasp the idea. It is not on
my own account that I take fees, but for the good
of the giver himself. For since one party in a
transaction must give and the other receive, I
train myself to receive and my pupil to give.
Buyer. It ought to be the other way about.
The young man ought to receive, and you, who
alone are rich, to give out.
Chrysippos. You are chaffing, fellow; but be
careful lest I let fly at you with the apodeiktic
syllogism.
Buyer. What are the frightful effects of the
weapon?
Chrysippos. Embarrassment, silence, confusion
of mind. If you like, I will give you an extreme
example, and prove in a twinkling that you are a
stone.
Buyer. How a stone? You do not look to me
like Perseus with the Gorgon's head, my friend.


<pb n="78"/>



Chrysippos. This is the way.
body?
Is the stone a
Buyer. Yes.
Chrysippos. Well, is not a living creature a
body?
Buyer. Yes.
Chrysippos. But you are a living creature?
Buyer. Certainly, I have that appearance.
Chrysippos. Then you are a stone, for you are
a body.
Buyer. Heaven forbid! In Zeus' name, release
me and make me a man again!
Chrysippos. That is easy; be a man once more.
For, tell me, is every body a living creature?
Buyer. No.
Chrysippos. Well, is a stone a living creature?
Buyer. No.
Chrysippos. But you are a body?
Buyer. Yes.
Chrysippos. And being a body you are a living
creature?
Buyer. Yes.
Chrysippos. Then you are not a stone, because
you are a living creature.
Buyer. Thank you. My legs were getting lifeless already and stiff, like Niobe's. But I am
certainly going to buy you. What is his price?
Hermes. Two hundred and forty dollars.
Buyer. Here it is.


<pb n="79"/>
79
Hermes. Are you the sole purchaser ?
Buyer. Dear me, no. All these people are
with me.
Hermes. There are plenty of them, and strong
in the shoulder. They are fit for "the Mower."
Zeus. Don't waste time. Call up another, the
Peripatetic.
Hermes. You are the man I want-the handsome, the rich one.
Come now, buy the most intelligent life-the
one whose forte is omniscience!
Buyer. What sort of a person is he?
Hermes. He leads a reasonable, well-ordered
life, never doing either too much or too little.
Most important of all, he is double.
Buyer. What do you mean?
Hermes. It seems that his visible man is one
person and his inward man another; so, if you
buy him, remember to call the one "exoteric,"
the other "esoteric."
Buyer. What does he know best?
Hermes. That there are three classes of goods,
relating to the soul, the body, and to externals.
Buyer. He thinks like a human being. What
is his price?
Hermes. Three hundred and seventy-five dollars.
Buyer. That is high.


<pb n="80"/>



Hermes. No, my good fellow, for he seems to
have some money himself, so you can't buy him
too quickly. Moreover, you will presently learn
from him how long the gnat lives, how far down
the sea is lighted by the sun, and the nature of
the soul of the oyster.
Buyer. Herakles! there's precision for you.
Hermes. What would you say if you should
hear things a great deal shrewder than these—
how man is a laughing animal, but the ass neither
a laughing, nor a house-building, nor a seafaring
animal?
Buyer. Edifying and profitable knowledge! I
will take him for four hundred dollars.
Hermes. Done.
Zeus. Whom have we still left?
Hermes. The sceptic here. Come forward,
Pyrrhias, and be published as fast as you can.
Most of the people have already stolen away, and
there will be few buyers. All the same, who wants
this fellow, too?
Buyer. I do. But first tell me, what is your
line of knowledge?
Philosopher. Nothing.
Buyer. What do you mean by that?
Philosopher. That in my opinion nothing at all
exists.
Buyer. Then are we nobody, too?
Philosopher. I don't even know that.


<pb n="81"/>
81
Buyer. Nor whether you happen to be somebody, either?
Philosopher. I am still more ignorant of that,
by a good deal.
Buyer. What an uncertainty! But, tell me,
what do you want with these balances?
Philosopher. I weigh arguments in them and
get them even, and when I see them exactly equal
and of the same weight, then I am ignorant which
is the truer.
Buyer. What else are you clever at?
Philosopher. Everything, except chasing a runaway slave.
Buyer. Why can't you do that?
Philosopher. Because, good sir, I never appresee.
hend.
Buyer. Of course. You do seem to be a slow,
dull person. But what is the aim of your science?
Philosopher. Ignorance; neither to hear nor to
Buyer. You mean, then, to be blind and deaf?
Philosopher. Yes, and incapable of judgment
and sensation, and, in a word, the double of an
earthworm.
Buyer. I must buy you for that. How much
do you say
he is worth?
Hermes. Twenty dollars.
Buyer. Here it is. What have you to say, fellow? Have I bought you?



<pb n="82"/>



Philosopher. Doubtful.
Buyer. Not at all. I have purchased you and
paid the money.
Philosopher. I suspend my judgment about it
and consider.
Buyer. You will follow me, as my slave should.
Philosopher. Who knows whether you are telling the truth?
Buyer. The salesman and the eighteen dollars
and the by-standers.
Philosopher. Are there, then, any standing by?
Buyer. I will clap you into the mill in a moment, and persuade you by a vicious argument
that I am your master.
Philosopher. Suspend your judgment about
that.
Buyer. No, by Heaven, I have formed my opinion already!
Hermes. Here, stop your resistance and follow
your purchaser.
We will summon you again to-morrow, for we
are going to put up the lives of the private citizens and artisans and tradesfolk.

Mikyllos. May Zeus strike you dead,
you confounded cock, for the envy in
your heart and the clarion in your
throat! Why did you lift up your
voice and wake me when I was a
rich man in a glorious dream and revelling in
marvellous happiness? Can't you let me escape
by night either from poverty, which I hate even
worse than you? To judge from the great quiet
that still prevails it is not yet midnight. It can't
be, for I am not stiff yet with the early frost as
usual—that is my trusty clock to tell me of the
approach of day. But this sleepless beast has
begun to crow already, just at the end of the
evening, as if he were guarding the golden fleece
in the story. Not for your own good, though! I
shall certainly have my revenge when daylight
comes, and smash you with my club. You would
give me too much trouble just now, hopping about
in the dark.
Cock. Master Mikyllos, I thought I was going
to do you a kindness by being as beforehand with
the night as I could, so that you might get up
and finish most of your work. Certainly if you


<pb n="86"/>



make one shoe before sunrise you will be so much
ahead, having accomplished this towards your
daily bread. However, if you prefer to sleep, I
will hold my tongue at your pleasure and be as
dumb as a fish; but do you look out lest by
dreaming of riches you starve when you are
awake.
Mikyllos. O Zeus, god of prodigies, and Herakles, that keepest mischief from us, what is this
fearful thing? The cock spoke like a human
being!
Cock. Does a thing of this sort strike you, then,
as a prodigy—that I should speak the same tongue
as you?
Mikyllos. I should think it is a prodigy. But
do ye, O gods, avert misfortune from us!
Cock. You seem to me, Mikyllos, to be actually
illiterate. Have you not read Homer's poems,
in which Achilles's horse, too, Xanthos, bade a
long farewell to neighing, and stood in the midst
of the battle and conversed, reciting whole verses,
not prose as I do now? And he prophesied, too,
and foretold coming events, and was not considered to be doing anything out of the way; nor did
he who heard him call upon the Protector against
evil as you did, thinking the sound an omen to
be averted. Moreover, what would you have
done if the keel of the Argo had spoken to you,
or if the oak of Dodona had prophesied for you


<pb n="87"/>

THE COCK.

with its own voice, or if you
had seen skins creeping and heard the flesh of oxen lowing half-roasted on the spits? I am the coadjutor of Hermes,
who is the most loquacious and eloquent of all
the gods, and for the rest I was not likely to find
much trouble in mastering the human language,
seeing that I live with you and share your table.
But if you should promise me to keep the secret
I would not mind telling you the truer reason of
our having the same language, and how I came
to speak thus.
Mikyllos. But is not this a dream, too: a cock
talking to me like this? Tell me, then, in the
name of Hermes, my friend, what other reason
there is for your gift of speech. You need not
fear that I shall break silence and tell any one,
for who would believe me if I told anything, giving out that I had heard it from a cock?
Cock. Listen, then. I am well aware that what
I say will be most incredible to you, Mikyllos-
I who now appear to you in the guise of a cock
was not long ago a man.
Mikyllos. I have heard something of the kind
about your race before: that a certain young
man named Cock became a friend of Ares, and
was a boon companion of the god, joined his revels, and shared his love affairs. So whenever
Ares went to see his mistress, Aphrodite, he took
Cock along, too, and, because he was suspicious


<pb n="88"/>



chiefly of the Sun, lest he should look down upon
them and tell tales to Hephaistos, he always left
the young man outside at the door to report the
rising of the Sun. On one occasion Cock fell
asleep and betrayed his post without meaning to,
and the Sun appeared unexpectedly to Aphrodite
and to Ares, taking his rest securely in his confidence that Cock would let him know if any one
approached. In this way Hephaistos learned
about them from the Sun and caught them, netting them and snaring them in the bonds which
he had wrought for them before. Ares, when he
was released, was furious against Cock, and
changed him into the bird of that name, armor
and all, so that he still has the crest of his helmet on his head; and this is the reason why,
whenever you perceive the sun about to rise you
lift up your voices long before to declare his rising, defending yourself to Ares, though it will do
you no good now.
Cock. They tell that story, too; but my case
was somewhat different, and it is quite lately that
I turned into a cock, at your service.
Mikyllos. In what way? I have the greatest
desire to know.
Cock. Do you know by hearsay one Pythagoras,
a Samian, the son of Mnesarchos ?
Mikyllos. Do you mean the sophist, the impostor, who made laws against tasting meat or eating


<pb n="89"/>

THE COCK.
89
beans-declaring my favorite dish banished from
the table-and who moreover persuaded people
to keep silence for five years?
Cock. Of course you know this, too, that before
he was Pythagoras he was Euphorbos?
Mikyllos. They say that fellow was a juggler
and a conjurer.
Cock. I myself am none other than that Pythagoras; so stop your railing at me, my friend,
particularly since you do not know what manner
of man I was.
Mikyllos. This is an even greater prodigy than
the other, to find a cock a philosopher! However, tell me, son of Mnesarchos, how is it that
you have appeared to me as a bird instead of a
man, and a Tanagrian instead of a Samian. The
thing is incredible. I can't readily believe it, for
I think I have observed two traits in you already
very unlike Pythagoras.
Cock. What are they?
Mikyllos. For one thing, you are talkative and
noisy, while he, I believe, used to enjoin five whole
years of silence. And the other thing is also entirely contrary to his law, for yesterday, when I
had no food to scatter for you, I came and
brought some beans, as you know, and you did
not hesitate to pick them up.
So that either you
have lied and are somebody else, or else, if you
are Pythagoras, you have broken the law, and by


<pb n="90"/>



eating beans have committed as great an impiety
as if
you had devoured your father's head.
Cock. Nay, Mikyllos, you do not know the reason of these things, nor what is suitable to each
life. Formerly I did not eat beans, because I
was a philosopher; but now I am willing to eat
them, for they are bird's food and not forbidden
to us. But come, you shall hear if you like how,
after being Pythagoras, I come to be as you see,
and what sort of lives I lived before, and what
good I got of each transformation.
Mikyllos. Pray tell me; I should be enchanted
to listen. If some one should ask me to choose
whether I preferred to hear you tell about these
things or see that heavenly dream again that I
had a little while ago, I do not know which I
should choose. You see how nearly akin I judge
what you offer to the sweetest visions, and I hold
you both in equal esteem, you and the blessed
dream.
•
Cock. What are you still pondering on your
dream, wondering who in the world it was that
appeared to you? Still cherishing certain fond
images and chasing in memory an empty and (as
the poets would say) fleeting happiness?
Mikyllos. I can tell you, Cock, that I will never
forget that vision. The dream as it went left so
much honey in my eyes that I can hardly lift my
lids, for it drags them down again to sleep. You


<pb n="91"/>

THE COCK.
91
know the tickling you get if you twirl a feather
in your ear; well, that is just the sensation I had
from my dream.
Cock. By Herakles, this is a marvellous love
that you declare for a dream! They say dreams
are winged and their flight is bounded by sleep,
but this one has leaped beyond the mark and
lingers in open eyes, seeming so honey-sweet and
vivid. I should really like to hear what it was like,
since you long for it so.
Mikyllos. I am ready to tell you, for it is a
pleasure to me to recall and describe something
of it. But when will you, Pythagoras, tell me
about your transformations?
Cock. When you, Mikyllos, stop dreaming and
rub the honey from your eyelids.
But tell me
this first, whether your dream was sent through
the gates of ivory or the gates of horn.
Mikyllos. Through neither, Pythagoras.
Cock. But Homer tells of these two only.
Mikyllos. Don't talk to me about that fool of a
poet, who knew nothing about dreams. Perhaps
poor dreams such as he used to see-not very
clearly, either, for he was blind-came through
such gates; but mine, the most beautiful, came
through golden gates, and itself was golden and
clothed all in gold, and brought heaps of gold
with it.
Cock. Stop your tale of gold, you Midas!


<pb n="92"/>



Mikyllos. I saw heaps of gold, Pythagorasheaps. You can't think how beautiful it was or
how radiantly it shone! What is it Pindar says
in praise of it? Remind me, if you know. He
says water is best, and then goes on to speak of
gold, placing a eulogy of it very properly at the
very beginning of the book, in the most beautiful
of all his odes.
Cock. This is probably what you want: "Best
of all things is water, but gold-like a flaming
fire by night it blazes out from all the haughty
store of wealth."
Mikyllos. The very thing, by Zeus! Pindar
writes this praise of gold just as if he had seen
my dream. If you wish to hear what it was like,
listen, most sagacious Cock. You know I did not
dine at home yesterday. Eukrates the millionaire
fell in with me in the market-place and bade me
come to his house after my bath in time for dinner.
Cock. I know it very well, for I went hungry
all day until you came home late in the evening,
rather drunk, and brought me those five beans—
not a very ample meal for a cock who has been
an athlete in his day and competed at Olympia,
not without distinction.
Mikyllos. Well, when I had come home from
dinner I went to sleep as soon as I had given you
the beans; and then, through the ambrosial night,
as Homer says, a really heavenly dream appeared.


<pb n="93"/>

THE COCK.
93
Cock. First, Mikyllos, tell me what happened
at Eukrates's house, and what sort of a dinner
you had, and all about the drinking-party after
it. For there is nothing to prevent your dining
again by fashioning a dream, as it were, of that
dinner, and chewing in memory the cud of what
you ate.
Mikyllos. I thought I should bore you if I described that, too; but since you wish it, I will
certainly tell it. Never in all my life before, Pythagoras, had I dined with a rich man, when by
some good-fortune I chanced upon Eukrates yesterday. I addressed him as usual, with "Goodmorning, sir," and said no more lest I should
mortify him by accompanying him in my shabby
clothes. But he said, “Mikyllos, I am celebrating my daughter's birthday to-day, and I have
asked a good many friends. Now I hear that
one of them is poorly and not able to dine with
me, so come yourself in his place after your bath,
unless, indeed, the man I invited sends word
finally that he will come. At present he is undecided."
When I heard this I made him a low bow and
went off praying to all the gods to send a fever of
some sort, or a pleurisy, or the gout, to that invalid whose successor and substitute I had been
asked to be. The interval before bathing seemed
ages long, because I was forever looking to see


<pb n="94"/>



what o'clock it was and at what hour one ought
to have had his bath. And as soon as the time
came I scrubbed myself in a hurry, and went
off dressed with great propriety, having so adjusted my tunic that the cleaner part might be
thrown over my shoulder. At the door I found
a crowd, and among them, carried by four men in
a litter, the man in whose stead I was to have
dined, the one that was said to be ill, and indeed
he was evidently in a bad way, for he groaned a
little and had a slight cough, and cleared his
throat from far down and with difficulty. He was
of a uniform yellow and bloated, and nearly sixty
years old. He was said to be a philosopher of
the school that talks nonsense to boys. At all
events, he wore a goat-like beard of an absurd
length; and when Archibios, the doctor, blamed
him for having come in this condition, he said,
"Duty must be done, above all by a philosopher,
even though a thousand diseases stand in the
way; for Eukrates would think I held him lightly.”
"Not at all," said I. "On the contrary, he will
commend you if you prefer dying at home by
yourself to coughing up your soul at the dinner."
To preserve his dignity he pretended that he
had not heard the scoff. Presently Eukrates appeared from the bath, and when he saw Thesmopolis- for that was the philosopher's name
"Professor," said he, “it is kind of you to come


<pb n="95"/>

THE COCK.
95
to me.
Still you would have lost nothing if you
had stayed away, for your dinner would have been
sent to you course by course."
As he spoke he entered the house, leading
Thesmopolis by the hand, who was also supported by his servants. Accordingly I got ready to
take myself off, but Eukrates turned round and
after a good deal of hesitation said, when he saw
me looking very downcast, "Come along, too,
Mikyllos, and dine with us. I will tell my son to
have his supper with his mother in the nursery so
that there may be a place for you."
So I went in like a wolf who has almost lost
his
prey, ashamed that they should think I had
driven Eukrates's boy from the table. When it
was time to take our places on the couches, they
first lifted Thesmopolis and set him up. It was
no small job, by Zeus ! for five—I think it was five
-well-grown young men, and they stuffed cushions in all round him to keep him in position and
enable him to hold out a long time. Then, as
nobody could endure to sit near him, they took
me and deposited me beside him, so that we
were neighbors. Thereupon we dined, Pythagoras, and had a bountiful and varied dinner off
abundance of silver and gold. There were golden goblets, and the waiters were beautiful boys,
and between the courses there were singing-girls
and clowns, and on the whole the entertainment


<pb n="96"/>



was delightful. The only drawback was that
Thesmopolis gave me a good deal of trouble by
boring me and talking to me about the "higher
life," and instructing me that two negatives make
an affirmative, and that if it is day it is not night,
and sometimes he even proved that I had horns.
He strung together a great deal more of such
philosophy for me, quite gratuitously, and cut off
my mirth, because he would not let me listen to
the cither-playing and singing. Such, Cock, was
the dinner.
Cock. Not much fun, Mikyllos, particularly as
you were assigned to that silly old man.
Mikyllos. But now hear my dream, too. I
thought that Eukrates was dying, being somehow
childless, and he sent for me and made a will by
which I was heir to everything he had, and shortly after died. I came into possession of the property, and drew gold and silver by the bucketful
from a perennial stream. As to other things,
clothing, and furniture, and plate, and servants,
all I had was just what you would expect. I drove
in a white chariot, lolling back, stared at and envied by all spectators. A quantity of servants
ran and rode before me, and more followed. I
wore his clothes and had as many as sixteen massive rings on my fingers, and I was ordering some
brilliant feast to be prepared for the entertainment of my friends. Then, after the manner of


<pb n="97"/>

THE COCK.
97
dreams, they were already present, and the supper was just being served, and the drinking was
about to begin. I was in this situation, and pledging each of my guests in golden goblets, and the
dessert was just coming in, when you raised your
inopportune cry, put our feast to confusion, overturned the tables and scattered that wealth so
that it was blown to the winds. Does it strike
you that my anger against you was unreasonable?
I should have liked to see that dream for three
nights running.
Cock. What a lover you are of gold and wealth,
Mikyllos. Do you admire this one thing of all
others, and think it is happiness to have quantities of gold?
Mikyllos. I am not alone in my opinion, Pythagoras. You yourself, when you were Euphorbos, decked your locks with gold and silver when
you went to fight the Achaians, actually in battle, where it was a better plan to carry iron than
gold; but even there you thought you must
wreathe your hair with gold before you fought.
And in my judgment that is why Homer said
your hair was like the Graces, because
"it was
tightly bound with gold and with silver." For it
is plain that it looked much more goodly and delightful when it was braided with the gold and
vied with it in splendor. Still it does not make
much difference, Goldlocks, whether you, who
7


<pb n="98"/>



were only Panthoos's son, honored gold or not.
But the father of all men and gods, the son of
Kronos and Rhea, when he fell in love with that
Argolian girl, knew no lovelier form to assume,
and no better way to break through the guard of
Akrisios-you know, of course, that he turned
into gold, and poured through the roof to be with
his beloved. So why should I go on to tell you
anything more about it, saying how many wants
gold fills, and how it makes its owners handsome
and clever and powerful, adds glory and reputation to them, and sometimes brings them in a
twinkling from obscurity and contempt to prominence and fame. Now, you know my neighbor
and fellow-craftsman, Simon, who dined with me
not long ago; that time in the holidays when I
made a bean soup with two slices of sausage in it.
Cock. I know the little snub-nosed creature.
He picked up the earthen cup, the only one we
had, and carried it off under his arm. I saw him,
Mikyllos.
Mikyllos. Then was he that stole it, and
afterwards called so many gods to witness his
innocence ! But why did you not cry out and
tell of him then, Cock, when you saw us being
robbed?
Cock. I crowed, which was all I could do then.
But what has Simon done? I thought you had
something to say about him.


<pb n="99"/>

THE COCK.
99
and,
Mikyllos. He had a cousin named Drimylos,
who was enormously rich. While he was living
he never gave Simon a cent. Why should he,
who never touched his money himself? But he
died the other day, and all his property has come
by law to Simon, and now he of the dirty rags,
he who used to lick his soup-plate, drives at his
ease, wearing purple and scarlet, owning slaves
and carriages and golden goblets and ivory tables,
with the crowd bowing before him, and not so
much as a glance for me any longer. At least,
I saw him passing close by me and said, "How
do you do, Simon ?" But he flew into a rage and
said, "Tell this beggar not to shorten my name.
I am not called Simon, but Simonides." And
what is more important, the women are in love
with him already, but he is coy with them and
fastidious. Some he approves and treats graciously, but others threaten to hang themselves
because of his neglect. You see what good things
gold can do, if it even transforms the ugly and
makes them charming, as that cestus did in the
poem. You know, too, what the poets say:
"O gold, fairest of possessions;"
"For it is gold that sways mortals."
But what are you laughing at in the midst of my
story, Cock?


<pb n="100"/>



Cock. To see you, too, Mikyllos, sharing the
vulgar error about rich people through your ignorance. Be assured that they live a much more
wretched life than you do. I tell you as one who
has been both poor and rich over and over again,
and tried every sort of life. It will not be long
before you yourself will have knowledge of each.
Mikyllos. By Zeus! it is high time for you to
take your turn and tell about your metamorphoses,
and what you know about each life.
Cock. Listen, but first know this, that I have
seen no living soul happier than you.

But
Mikyllos. Than I? I wish you the same,
you move me to use bad language to you.
begin with Euphorbos, and tell me how you were
changed into Pythagoras, and so on in order down
to the cock. For you must have had a variety of
sights and experiences in your manifold lives.
Cock. How my soul first took its flight from
Apollo down to earth, and made its way into the
body of a man in expiation of some crime would
be over long to tell; and, moreover, it is not lawful for me to speak or you to hear such matters
as these. Then I became Euphorbos.
Mikyllos. Tell me this first, have I, too, ever
been changed like you?
Cock. Certainly.
Mikyllos. Who was I, then, if you can tell me,
for I long to know.


<pb n="101"/>

me.
Cock. You? You were an Indian ant of the
gold-digging variety.
Mikyllos. Poor devil, why did I hesitate to provide myself with even a few grains when I came
from that life to this? But tell me, too, what I
am going to be next. Probably you know. If it
should be anything good, I will get up forthwith
and hang myself from the peg you are standing on.
Cock. There is no way by which you can learn
that. But when I became Euphorbos-to go
back to what I was saying-I fought at Ilion, fell
by the hand of Menelaos, and shortly after passed
into Pythagoras. In the mean time I hung about
homeless until Mnesarchos wrought my home for
Mikyllos. With nothing to eat, my good sir, or
to drink?
Cock. Of course. It is only the body that needs
such things.
Mikyllos. Well, then, tell me first about affairs
at Ilion. Were things as Homer says they were?
Cock. How did he know anything about it, seeing he was a Baktrian camel at the time? But I
will tell you this, that nothing was remarkable in
those days. Ajax was not so tall nor Helen herself so beautiful as they are thought to have been.
I saw some one with a white skin and a long
neck, as was natural in a swan's daughter, but
for the rest she was an old woman, almost He-

kuba's age.
For Theseus, who was born in the
time of Herakles, first carried her off and held
her in Aphidnai; and Herakles captured Troy
before in the days of our fathers at the latest.
Panthoos used to tell me all these things, saying
that he had seen Herakles when he was a boy.
Mikyllos. Dear me! Was Achilles, as he is
said to be, best in every way, or is that, too, a
myth?
Cock. I never encountered him in battle, and
I could not give you so exact an account of the
Achaians' affairs. How could I, seeing that I
was an enemy? However, I killed his comrade,
Patroklos, without much trouble, piercing him
with my spear.
Mikyllos. And then Menelaos killed you more
easily still.
But that will do on this subject. Now tell me
about Pythagoras.
Cock. I was a complete sophist, Mikyllos, for
it is right, I think, to tell the truth. However, I
was not uneducated nor neglectful of the noblest
studies, and I even journeyed to Egypt to receive
instruction from the priests. I made my way into
the temples and mastered the books of Oros and
Isis. And then I sailed back to Italy and so
wrought upon the Greeks there that they reckoned me a god.
Mikyllos. I have heard of this, and that you


<pb n="103"/>

THE COCK.
103
were deemed to have risen from the dead, and
that you once showed them that your thigh was
gold. But tell me this, why did it occur to you
to make a law against eating either flesh or
beans?
Cock. Don't ask such things, Mikyllos.
Mikyllos. Why not?
Cock. Because I am ashamed to tell you the
truth about them.
Mikyllos. Now, there is no reason whatever for
hesitating to tell a man who is your messmate
and friend, for I would no longer call myself your
master.
Cock. I had no sound or reasonable motive;
but seeing that if my practices were ordinary and
the same as most people's, I should fail to draw
on men to wonder at me, but the more outlandish
they were the more august I seemed to them, this
was the reason why I chose to innovate, pretending that my grounds were too holy for discussion,
so that each might have his conjecture, and all
stand amazed as at the dark sayings of the oracles. There, even you are laughing at me in
your turn.
Mikyllos. Not so much at you as at the Krotoniates and Metapontines and Tarentines and
the others who followed you speechless and kissed
the footprints you left as you walked.
But when you had laid Pythagoras aside, what


<pb n="104"/>



character did you clothe yourself with after
him?
Cock. Aspasia, the courtesan from Miletos.
Mikyllos. Oh, what a tale! Pythagoras became
even a woman among other people, and there was
a time when you, most noble cock, were Aspasia,
Perikles' mistress, and carded wool and wove the
weft and sold your favors!
Cock. I am not the only man who has done all
these things. Teiresias, too, before me, and
Kaineus, Elatos' son, were in my case, so that
any joke you make against me will also be made
against them.
Mikyllos. Tell me, which life did you find.
pleasanter, when you were a man or when Perikles
caressed you?
Cock. Beware of asking a question that was not
agreeable even to Teiresias.
Mikyllos. Even if you will not tell me, Euripides
decided the matter adequately, saying that he
would rather stand by his shield thrice than bear
one child.
Cock. You will be a woman yourself, Mikyllos,
over and over in the great lapse of time.
Mikyllos. Be hanged to you for thinking every
one a Milesian or a Samian.
But what shape of man or woman did you ap
pear in after Aspasia ?
Cock. The cynic Krates.


<pb n="105"/>

THE COCK.
105
Mikyllos. Ye gods, that's a change - from a
courtesan to a philosopher!
Cock. Then I was a king, then a poor man, and
a little while after a satrap, then a horse, and a
jackdaw, and a frog, and a thousand other things.
It would take too long to enumerate them all.
Finally I have been a cock many times, for I liked
the life. I have served many others, kings and
poor men and rich men, and now finally I live
with you, laughing daily to hear you weep and
wail over your poverty and admire the rich, in
your ignorance of the evils belonging to them.
Certainly, if you knew the cares they have, your
first laugh would be at yourself for thinking a
rich man over-happy.
Mikyllos. Well then, Pythagoras, or whatever
you would prefer to be called, so that I may not
disturb your recital, calling you first one thing
and then another-
Cock. It makes no difference whether
you call
me Euphorbus or Pythagoras or Aspasia or
Krates, for I am all these. But you would do
best to call this present form "Cock," not to be
lacking in respect to the bird because it is held a
humble creature, seeing that it embraces so many
souls.
Mikyllos. Well then, Cock, since you have tried
pretty much every life and been everything, kindly
tell me now what the private life of the rich is


<pb n="106"/>



and of the poor, too, to show me whether you are
telling the truth when you declare me happier
than the rich.
Cock. Come, look at it in this way: To you
war is of no great moment, or the report that the
enemy is invading us. You do not worry lest
they attack your farm, cut down your crops,
trample your shrubberies under foot, or ravage
your grapes. When the trumpet sounds, if, indeed, you hear it at all, the most you do is to look
for a place of safety for yourself, where you may
escape the danger. But the rich, in addition to
their personal anxiety, have the misery of looking
from the walls and seeing all they had on their
estates driven or carried away. And if subsidies
are needed, they alone are called upon, and if an
army must go out they have the posts of most
danger as generals or cavalry officers. But you
have an osier-shield, you are well equipped and
lightly armed, so that you can save yourself, and
you are ready to feast in honor of the victory
when the triumphant general sacrifices to the
gods.
In peace, on the other hand, you are one of
the people, and you enter the assembly and
domineer over the rich. They tremble and
crouch before you, and propitiate you with grants,
slaving to provide you with baths and games and
shows and the other things in abundance. But


<pb n="107"/>

THE COCK.
107
you, as auditor of the public accounts or examiner, rule them like a savage master, sometimes
without even accounting for your acts. If it
seems good to you, you shower down stones on
them like hail with a free hand, or confiscate their
property. You have no fear of the sycophant
for your person, or of the robber lest he climb
over the coping or burrow through the wall and
steal your gold. And you need not trouble yourself with keeping accounts or dunning people or
wrestling with those confounded stewards. No
such cares tear you asunder. No; when you
have finished a shoe and received your twenty
cents for it, you leave your work towards nightfall, and, if you like, have your bath; then you
buy a salt fish or some sprats or a handful of
onions, and with this you make merry, singing
most of the time, and philosophising with your
good friend, poverty. This kind of life makes
you healthy and strong and hardens you against
the cold, for you are so whetted on the grindstone
of your hardships that you are a shrewd fighter
against things that other people find irresistible.
Of course, none of those distressing diseases
come your way. If ever a light fever touches
you, you give way to it for a little, but then you
start up and forthwith shake off the trouble. It
flees on the instant in terror when it sees that you
are a cold-water drinker, and have said a long


<pb n="108"/>



fare-ill to the doctor's visits. But those who have
come to grief through indulgence have every evil
under the sun gout and consumption and pneumonia and dropsy, for these are the offspring of
those sumptuous dinners. Accordingly, some of
them who fly high, like Ikaros, and get near the
sun, not knowing their plumage is fastened with
wax, fall occasionally head-foremost into the sea
with a mighty splash. But those who follow Daedalos, and whose ideas are not too lofty, but so
near the earth that the wax is sometimes wet
with spray, these, for the most part, fly in safety.
Mikyllos. That is to say, people of good common-sense.
Cock. But the other sort, Mikyllos, make shameful shipwreck. When Kroisos's feathers are
plucked the Persians laugh to see him mount the
pyre. Dionysios, his kingdom lost, is seen teaching school in Corinth. He descended from such
a throne as his to teach children to spell.
Mikyllos. Tell me, Cock, when you were a king
-for you say you were once even on the throne
—what was your experience of that life? I suppose you were perfectly happy, for you had whatever is best of all good things.
Cock. Do not remind me of that thrice unhappy
time. As far as those external goods go that you
speak of, I seemed indeed perfectly happy, but
I had athousand troubles within.


<pb n="109"/>

THE COCK.

Mikyllos. What were they? This is astonishing, and I don't altogether believe it.
Cock. I ruled over a large and fertile country,
Mikyllos, fit to rank with the best for its population and the beauty of its cities. It was traversed
by navigable rivers, and had a seaboard with
good harbors. I had a large army, with welltrained cavalry, a considerable body-guard, a
navy, untold treasure, quantities of gold plate,
and all the rest of the royal mise en scène in profusion and excess. Whenever I went abroad the
crowd saluted me, believing they beheld a god,
and thronged on each others' heels to get sight
of me; some would even mount the roofs and
count it a great thing to have a clear view of my
chariot, my robes, my outriders, and my escort.
But I, conscious of my sorrows and agonies,
made allowance for their ignorance and pitied my
own case, which I compared with the colossal
statues that Pheidias or Myron or Praxiteles
wrought. Each of these, too, if you look at it
from the outside, is a Poseidon or a Zeus of perfect beauty, made in gold or ivory, grasping the
thunderbolt or the lightning or the trident in his
right hand; but if you stoop and look inside you
will see bars and bolts and nails piercing from
side to side, and timbers and wedges and pitch
and clay and a great many other things just as
unsightly which are hidden there, to say nothing


<pb n="110"/>



of the crowds of rats and mice that sometimes
colonize them. Well, royalty is much like this.
Mikyllos. But you have not told me what the
clay and bolts and bars of royalty are, nor the
nature of that mass of unsightly things. To be
stared at when you drive out, and to rule so many
people, and to be saluted like a god, may justly
be likened to the great statue, for they are both
well-nigh divine. But tell me now, what is inside
the colossus?
Cock. Where shall I begin? With the fears
and frights and suspicions? The hatred and
plots of those about the king? The scanty sleep,
and that with one eye open, that these leave him?
The troubled dreams, the tangled schemes, the
hopes that never come to pass? Or the press of
business, the audiences, the decisions, the going
out to war, the orders to be given, the treaties to
be made, the accounts to be kept?. This will not
suffer a king to have any pleasure, even in his
dreams, but he alone must keep watch for all
and feel a thousand cares.
"For sweet sleep held not Agamemnon, son of
Atreus, revolving many things in his mind,"
though all the Achaians were snoring. Kroisus
was troubled because his son was deaf, Artaxerxes
because Klearchos hired himself to Cyros, another
ruler because Dion whispered in the ears of some
of the Syracusans, and another because Parme-

nion was praised. Ptolemy made Perdikkas
wretched, and Seleukos did the same for Ptolemy. There are other sources of trouble, too:
love won by force, a mistress that bestows her
favors elsewhere, rumors of sedition, two or three
of the body-guard whispering together. Worst
of all, a king must hold his nearest and dearest
in the greatest suspicion, and be ever expecting
an ill turn from them. This one died of poison
by his son's hand; that one actually was killed
by his beloved; a third, perhaps, was snatched
by a like manner of death.
Mikyllos. That will do! These are horrible
things you tell me of. To my mind, then, it is a
good deal safer to sit stooping over one's last
than to drink from a golden goblet if the lovingcup is mixed with hemlock or aconite. The only
danger I run is of cutting my fingers so that they
bleed for a moment, if my knife should slip aside
and run out of the straight groove. But they, by
your story, feast on deadly food, surrounded by
a thousand evils. Then, when they fall from
power, they are more like the tragic actors than
anything else, whom you may see often with diadems, and ivory-hilted swords, and waving hair,
and gold-sprinkled cloaks, as long as they are
Kekrops or Sisyphos or Telephos. But if one of
them steps into a hole, as often happens, and
tumbles down in the middle of the stage, see how


<pb n="112"/>

I 12

the spectators laugh at the broken mask and diadem, and the actor's own bleeding head, and his
legs bared so that you can see the wretched rags
under his robe, and the straps that hold on his
shapeless and ill-fitting buskins. You see how I
have learned the art of simile from you already,
my best of cocks! But we have seen what royalty is like; when you became a horse or a dog
or a fish or a frog, how did you enjoy that sort of
life?
Cock. You raise a great question, and this is
not the time to discuss it. But to put it in a
nutshell, every one of those lives, in my judgment, is freer from care than the human life,
being measured only by the physical desires and
needs. You will never find among the animals a
horse who is a tax-gatherer, or a frog who is a
spy, or a jackdaw who is a sophist, or a mosquito
who is a cook, or a cock who is a libertine, or
any other evil life you can think of.
Mikyllos. Probably this is all very true, Cock,
but I will confess my case to you without shame.
I am still unable to rid my mind of the longing I
have had from childhood to be a rich man. In
fact, the dream still stands before my eyes pointing to gold, and, most of all, it chokes me to think
of that confounded Simon revelling in such goodfortune.
Cock. I will cure you, Mikyllos. It is still

night, so get up and come with me. I will take
you to see Simon and into the houses of the other
rich men, to show you how things are with them.
Mikyllos. How can you? The doors are
locked. You are not going to make a burglar of
me, are you?
Cock. Heaven forbid; but Hermes, whose sacred bird I am, bestowed on me this special gift:
if my longest tail-feather, the one that curls because it is so soft, be-
Mikyllos. But you have two like that!
Cock. The man whom I permit to pluck the
right hand one and keep it will be able to open
any door and see everything, himself unseen, as
long as I am willing.
Mikyllos. I did not know, Cock, that you are a
sorcerer, too. Now if you will give me this chance
once, you will soon see all Simon's wealth transferred to this house; for if I can make my way in
I will carry it off, and then he will have to come
back to his lasts and nibble for a living.
Cock. That is not permitted. Hermes commanded me, if the holder of the feather should
do anything of the sort, to give the alarm and
have him caught in the theft.
Mykillos. That is a likely story! Hermes, a
thief himself, begrudges theft to others! However, let us be off. I will keep my hands off the
gold if I can.

Cock. First, Mikyllos, pluck the soft feather.
What are you doing? You have plucked them
both!
Mykillos. To be on the safe side, Cock. And
you will look better so. Your tail will be more
symmetrical.
Cock. All right. Shall we go to see Simon first,
or some other millionaire ?
Mikyllos. Oh, Simon, by all means, who thinks
himself a greater man by two syllables now he is
rich. Here we are already at his door. What
must I do next?
Cock. Touch the bolt with the feather.
Mykillos. That's done. Gracious heaven, the
door has opened as if with a key!
Cock. Go in first. There, do you see him keeping vigil over his accounts?
Mikyllos. Yes! by Zeus, with a feeble, ill-fed
lamp. And he is pale, I don't know why, and he
has fallen away to a skeleton. It must be from
anxiety, for I never heard he was ill otherwise.
Cock. Hear what he says. Then you will know
why he is thus.
Simon. So that seventy thousand dollars is
pretty safely buried under the bed, and nobody
at all knows about it; but I have an idea that
Sosylos the groom saw me burying the sixteen
thousand under the manger. Anyhow, he is forever about the stable now, though he was not so

And
very careful or fond of his work before.
probably I am being plundered of a good deal
besides this; for where did Tibios get the money
for those large fish they say he bought yesterday,
and those ear-rings for his wife, worth a dollar at
least? It is my money they are snatching, unlucky wretch that I am! Even my plate is not
safely stored, and there is so much of it! I am
afraid a house-breaker will get it. A great many
people envy me and plot against me, particularly
my neighbor Mikyllos.
Mikyllos. Yes, by Zeus! I am going off with a
basin under my arm just as you did!
Cock. Hush, Mikyllos, he will know we are here.
Simon. The best plan is to sit up all night myself and look after everything. I will get up and
make the round of the house. Who is that? I
see you, you thief— Good heaven, you are only
a pillar-that's all right.
I will dig up my money and count it again, lest
I overlooked any the day before yesterday.
There, I hear some one coming to attack me
again. Every one is besieging me and plotting
against me. Where is my dagger? If I catch
any one-
Come, I must bury the money again.
Cock. Such, Mikyllos, is the state of affairs
with Simon. Let us be off to some one else while
there is still a little of the night left.


<pb n="116"/>



Mikyllos. Poor devil, what a life he leads. May
my enemies get rich like him! I want to give
him one good thump and then go off.
Simon. Who struck me? I am robbed, wretched man!
Mikyllos. Bemoan yourself and lie awake, and
stick to your gold till you turn to the color of it!
Let us go, if you please, to see Gniphon, the
money-lender. He lives near by.
This door, too, opened of itself.
Cock. See, he is awake with his cares like the
other, calculating his interest with his fingers stiff
already. He must soon leave all these behind
and turn to a book-worm or a carrion-fly.
Mikyllos. I see a wretched, senseless human
being, whose life now is not much better than a
worm's or a gnat's. He, too, is worn to the bone
with his accounts.
Cock. Well, now, Mikyllos, should you like to
fall heir to all this, along with the wealth of Eukrates?
Mikyllos. Heaven forbid, Cock. I would rather
starve. Farewell to gold and dinners! I call
five cents a better fortune than to be robbed by
your servants.
Cock. But for this time we must go home, for
day is already beginning to break.
You shall see the rest another time, Mikyllos.

Charon. Well, Klotho, my skiff here
has been ready and in prime sailingtrim this long time. I have baled it
out and set up the mast and bent
the sail and furnished every oar with
a thong. As far as I am concerned, there is nothing
to prevent our weighing anchor and setting sail.
But Hermes is late; he ought to have been here
long ago. The ferry-boat is empty of passengers,
as you see, though it might have made the passage
three times to-day already. It is almost evening
now, and we have not yet taken in a single obol.
I know what will happen next. Pluto will suspect me of having been lazy in the matter, and
all the while somebody else is to blame. But our
noble and distinguished conductor of the dead
has taken a draught of the earthly Lethe like
any one else, and forgotten to come back to us.
He is either wrestling with the lads, or playing
the cither, or making speeches to air his nonsense; or very probably the gentleman is even
stealing on the sly, for that, too, is one of his
accomplishments. So he gives himself superior
airs, and yet he is half one of us.


<pb n="120"/>



Klotho. What, Charon? How do you know
that some pressage of business has not overtaken
him? Perhaps Zeus has had to use him more
than usual in matters above. He is his master,
too.
Charon. Not so far as to have more than his
share of control over a common servant. Certainly we have never detained him when he ought
to go. But I know why it is. Down here there
is nothing but asphodel and funeral libations and
sacrificial cakes and offerings to the shades. All
the rest is gloom and mist and darkness. But
in heaven everything is radiant, and there is ambrosia in abundance, and no stint of nectar. So
I imagine it is pleasanter to linger among these
things. He flies from here as though he were
running away from a prison. But when it is time
to come down his pace is so leisurely and slow
that he hardly gets here at all.
Klotho. Don't be angry any longer, Charon, for
here he is himself, quite near, you see, bringing us
a great many people and driving the crowd along
with his staff more as if they were a herd of
goats. But what is this? I see one in irons
among them, and another laughing, and one has
a leathern pouch slung about him and carries a
club in his hand. He looks fiercely about and
urges on the others. See, Hermes himself, too,
is dripping with perspiration and panting, and


<pb n="121"/>

his feet are covered with dust. He can hardly
breathe. What is the matter, Hermes? What is
your hurry?
It looks to us as if you were in
trouble.
Hermes. It is all this wretch here, Klotho. He
ran away, and I chased him till I came near deserting the ship for to-day.
Klotho. Who is he, and what did he want to
run away for?
Hermes. That is easy to see-because he preferred to live. He is some king or despot, to
judge from his lamentations and the things he
mourns for. He says he has been deprived of
great happiness of some sort.
Klotho. Then the poor fool tried to run away
because he thought he could come to life again
after the thread woven for him had already come
to an end?
Hermes. Tried to run away, do you say? Yes,
and if my very good friend here, the one with the
club, had not helped me to capture him and put
him in irons, he would have got clean away from
us. For, from the moment Atropos handed him
over to me, the whole way along he has been resisting and struggling, and he would plant his
feet on the ground so that he was not exactly
easy to conduct. And sometimes he would fall
to supplication and prayer, begging me to let him
go for a little and promising great bribes. But


<pb n="122"/>



I, of course, did not loose him, for I saw he was
longing for the impossible. But when we had
come to the very entrance and I was giving the
customary inventory of the dead to Aiakos, and
he was reckoning them by the memorandum sent
to him by your sister, that confounded villain
managed somehow to give us the slip and get
off. Accordingly, there was one soul short by
the count, and Aiakos, raising his eyebrows, said,
"Don't use your thieving skill in all departments,
Hermes. Be satisfied with your tricks in heaven.
Dealings with the dead are exact, and can in no
way evade scrutiny. The memorandum, you see,
has 'one thousand and four' written on it, but
you come bringing me one too few, unless you
are prepared to say that Atropos has falsified her
accounts for you."
I blushed at this speech, and instantly remembered what had happened on the road, and when
I cast my eye about and saw this fellow nowhere
I perceived that he had run away, and gave chase
as hard as I could up the road to daylight. This
good soul here followed me of his own motion.
We ran like racers, and only caught him at Tain-
He was as near as that to getting away.
Klotho. And we, Charon, were just accusing
Hermes of neglecting his duties!

Haven't we lost enough time already?

Klotho. You are right; let them embark. I
will take my note-book in my hand and sit by the
gangway, as usual; and as each one of them
comes aboard I will find out who he is and
whence he comes, and what sort of ath he died
by. Do you, Charon, receive them and stack
them together in lots; and you, Hermes, put
these new-born children aboard first. For how
could they answer any of my questions?
Hermes. See, ferryman, there are three hundred of these for you, counting those that were
exposed.
Charon. Dear me, that is a large bag. You
have brought us unripe dead.
Hermes. Shall we put the unwept aboard next
to these, Klotho?
Klotho. Do you mean the aged? Yes, do so.
Why should I trouble myself now to inquire into
such ancient history? All you who are over sixty
come forward at once. What is this? They do
not hear me, because their ears are stopped with
age. Probably you will have to lift these, too,
and ship them.
Hermes. Here is another lot, lacking two of
four hundred. These are all soft and ripe, and
gathered in their prime.
Charon. No, by Jove! they are all raisins already.
Klotho. Bring on the wounded next to these,


<pb n="124"/>



Hermes. I will begin with you. Tell me by what
death you have come here; or, rather, I will examine you by reference to the documents. Eightyfour must have died in battle yesterday in Mysia,
among them Gobares, the son of Oxyartes.
Hermes. They are here.
Klotho. Seven cut their own throats for love,
and Theagenes the philosopher on account of
the courtesan from Megara.
Hermes. These are at hand.
Klotho. Where are the two who killed each
other fighting for the throne?
Hermes. They are here.
Klotho. And he who was murdered by his wife
and her lover?
Hermes. Here he is, close by.
Klotho. Now bring those from the law-courts;
I mean the impaled and the flogged to death.
And where are the sixteen who were killed by
robbers?
Hermes. You see this lot are here, the wounded.
Shall I bring on the women en masse?
Klotho. By all means; and the shipwrecked en
masse, for they died in the same way.
And as
for the fever patients, bring them all at once, too,
and Agathokles the doctor with them.
Where is the philosopher Kyniskos, who ought
to have died of eating Hecate's supper and the
purifiactory eggs and a raw polyp to top off with?


<pb n="125"/>

THE FERRY.
125
Kyniskos. I have been standing here at your
service for some time, my good Klotho. What
wrong have I done that you left me on earth so
long? You almost spun out your whole spindle
for me. However, I tried often to cut the thread
and come, but somehow or other it was not to be
broken.
Klotho. I left you to be a guardian and physician of human errors. But come aboard, and
luck go with you!
Kyniskos. By Heaven, no, unless we shall first
have shipped the fellow in fetters, for I am afraid
he will persuade you with his prayers.
Klotho. Come, let me know who he is.
Hermes. Megapenthes, son of Lakydes, a despot.
Klotho. Come aboard.
Megapenthes. Not for worlds, Madam Klotho.
Let me go up for a little while. Then I will
come to you by my own free-will at no one's
summons.
Klotho. What is the reason you want to go?
Megapenthes. Give me time to finish my house.
I left my dwelling behind half built.
Klotho. Nonsense! Get in.
Megapenthes. I do not ask for a long time, Fate.
Let me stay just this one day, to appear to my
wife and tell her something about my moneywhere I kept my great treasure hidden.


<pb n="126"/>



Klotho. It is fixed. You cannot do it.
Megapenthes. Then will all that gold be lost?
Klotho. Not at all; you may be at ease about
that. Your cousin Megakles will get hold of it.
Megapenthes. Oh, what an affront! My enemy,
whom I was too easy-going to put to death before
me?
Klotho. The same. He will survive you forty
years and something over, in possession of your
harem and your clothes and all your wealth.
Mcgapenthes. It is unjust, Klotho, to assign my
property to my greatest enemies.
Klotho. I suppose, my noble sir, that you did
not seize it when it belonged to Kydimachos,
murdering the man himself and then slaying his
children on their father's warm body?
Megapenthes. But at present it was mine.
Klotho. Well, your time of possession had run
out.
Megapenthes. Listen, Klotho. There is something I should like to say to you in private without witnesses. You others step aside a moment.
If you will give me a chance to run away I
promise to give you this day a million dollars in
coin of the realm.
Klotho. You are absurd. Can you not get gold
and dollars out of your head yet?
Megapenthes. I will throw in the two bowls, if
you like, that I got when I killed Kleakritos.

They weigh a hundred talents of unalloyed gold
apiece.
Klotho. Drag him in, for apparently he will not
embark of his own will.
Megapenthes. I call you people to witness that
my wall and my dockyards are unfinished. I
could have completed them if I had lived five
days longer.
Klotho. Never mind. Some one else will build
them.
Megapenthes. Anyhow, this one thing it is perfectly reasonable to ask for.
Klotho. What is that?
Megapenthes. To come to life long enough to
subdue the Persians, and impose taxes on the
Lydians, and raise a huge monument to myself,
inscribing on it how many great and warlike
deeds I did in my lifetime.
Klotho. My man, this is not asking for a single
day any longer, but to spend about twenty years.
Megapenthes. I am ready, moreover, to furnish
sureties for my quickness and my reappearance.
If you wish it, I will even provide you a substitute in my place in the person of my one beloved
son.
Klotho. You wretch, him whom you have often
prayed you might leave behind you?
Megapenthes. That used to be my prayer, but
now I see the better course.


<pb n="128"/>



Klotho. He, too, will join you soon, slain by
the new king.
Megapenthes. Well, but do not refuse me this
thing at any rate, Fate.
Klotho. What is it?
Megapenthes. I wish to know what the course
of events will be after me.
Klotho. You shall, for your knowledge will be
an added torment. Midas the slave will have
your wife; he has been her lover this long time.
Megapenthes. The villain! It was by her persuasion that I gave him his freedom.
Klotho. Your daughter will be counted among
the harem of the present monarch.
Your portraits and statues, which the city erected for you
in times past, will all be overturned, a laughingstock to the beholders.
Megapenthes. Tell me, is not one of my friends
moved to anger by these acts?
Klotho. Why, who was a friend to you? What
reason had any one to be? You know that all
of them, those who bowed before you and those
who extolled your every word and deed, acted
from fear or hope, being friendly to your office
and having an eye to the main chance.
Megapenthes. And yet they used to pour out
their libations at the banquets, and pray with a
loud voice that many good things might befall me,
saying that every one of them was ready to die

in my stead if possible, and altogether they swore
by me.
Klotho. Accordingly, it was after dining with
one of them that you died yesterday. For that
last cup that was handed to you sent you here.
Megapenthes. That is why I tasted something
bitter! What was his object in doing it?
Klotho. You ask too many questions when you
ought to be embarking.
Megapenthes. There is one thing that chokes
me most of all, Klotho, and makes me long to
rise to the light again, if but for a moment.
Klotho. What is this? It must be something
tremendous.
Megapenthes. Karion, my slave, as soon as he
saw I was dead, came late in the evening into
the room where I was lying, without any trouble,
for no one was so much as watching by me, and
looked at me and said, "You wretched little
creature, you gave me a blow many a time when
I didn't deserve it." With these words he fell
to plucking out my hair and beating me to his
heart's content, and finally he spat upon me and
went off, saying, "Go to the devil!" I was aflame
with rage, but all the same I could not do anything to him, stiff and cold as I was. But if I
could get hold of him—
Klotho. Stop your threats and come aboard.
It is time now for you to go to your trial.

Megapenthes. And who will venture to pass
judgment on a man of kingly rank?

dead man must come before Rhadamanthos.
You will soon see him assigning his doom to
each with great justice and according to merit.
Don't waste any more time just now.

Charon. All right. He shall be made fast to
the mast.
Megapenthes. Assuredly I ought to be placed in
the seat of honor.
Klotho. Why?
Magapenthes. Because, by Heaven, I was a despot and had a body-guard of ten thousand men.
Kyniskos. Then Karion was right to pluck out
the hair of such a mischievous creature. You will
rue your tyranny when you have tasted the club.
Megapenthes. Will Kyniskos, then, dare to raise
his staff against me? Did I not almost crucify
you a day or two ago because you were too free
and rough and disrespectful?


<pb n="131"/>

THE FERRY.
131
Kyniskos. That is why you, too, will stay crucified against the mast.
Mikyllos. Tell me, Klotho, do you take no account of me at all? Or because I am a poor
man, is that a reason why I ought to be the last
to embark, too?
Klotho. And who are you?
Mikyllos. Mikyllos the shoemaker.
Klotho. And you object to lingering? Do you
not see what promises the tyrant makes on condition of being let off for a little while? I am
amazed, then, if you, too, are not pleased at the
delay.
Mikyllos. Listen, best of Fates. I am not greatly cheered by such a boon as the Cyclops gave to
"Noman" in promising to eat him last. First
or last, the same teeth are waiting. Moreover, I
am not in the same plight as the rich. Our lives
are poles asunder, as they say. Now the despot
was considered happy while he lived. He was
feared and stared at by all. When he left behind him so much gold and silver and raiment,
so many horses and banquets and lovely boys
and beautiful women, it was natural that he
should take it ill and grieve at being dragged
from them. For the soul sticks to such things
as if it were somehow glued to them, and it is
loth to give them up without a struggle, because
it has clung to them so long. Or, rather, it is as


<pb n="132"/>



if they had come to be bound by fetters that cannot be broken. Of course if any one drags them
off by force they shriek and beg mercy; and
though they have a bold face for other things,
they show themselves cowards about this, the
road that leads to Hades. They turn back and
have a lovesick longing to see the things of daylight even if from afar, just as this fool here did,
trying to run away on the road and persecuting
you with entreaties here. But I, because I had
nothing at stake in life, neither estates nor apartment houses nor gold nor furniture nor reputation nor portraits, naturally had my loins girt up;
and as soon as Atropos nodded to me I gladly
threw down my knife and my sole-for I had a
boot in my hand-and jumped up and followed
barefoot, not even waiting to wash off the stains.

turned my head or called me back. And, by
Zeus! I see already that everything is charming
down here; for in my opinion it is most delightful to have universal equality, and no one better
than his neighbor. I judge that debtors are not
dunned for their debts here nor taxes paid; and
most important of all, no one is frozen in winter
or falls ill or gets beaten by his betters. We poor
men laugh it is the rich who feel the pain and
bewail their case.

Klotho. I have seen you laughing for some
time, Mikyllos. What was it chiefly that stirred
your mirth?
Mikyllos. I will tell you, goddess of my greatest reverence. I lived near a despot on earth, so
that I saw pretty plainly all that went on in his
house, and he seemed to me then to be somehow
equal with the gods. For I counted him blessed
when I saw the bloom of his purple, the crowd
of his followers, the gold, the gemmed goblets,
the silver-footed couches. And, moreover, the
steam and savor of his dinner preparations used
to drive me wild, so that he seemed to me more
than mortal, thrice blessed, and almost handsomer
than other people, and taller by two feet! lifted
up as he was by fortune, dignified in his gait,
with head thrown back, inspiring awe in those he
met. But when he came to die, and had laid
aside his luxury like a garment, I saw all his absurdity; but still more I laughed at myself for
having admired such a wretch, judging of his
happiness from the steam of his kitchen, and
calling him blessed on the strength of the blood
of the shell-fish in the Laconic Sea. And he was
not the only one. When I saw the money-lender
Griphon groaning with remorse because he had
not had the good of his money, but was dying
without a taste of it, leaving his property to the
spendthrift Rodochares-for he was next of kin


<pb n="134"/>



and chief legatee by law-I could not help laughing; most of all when I remembered how yellow
and dirty he always was, his brow full of care and
rich only with the fingers that counted his millions, gathering little by little what lucky Rodochares will send spinning presently.
But why do we not proceed now? We will
have the rest of our fun on the voyage watching
the others bemoan themselves.
Klotho. Get in and let the ferryman draw up
the anchor.
Charon. My friend, where are you going? The
skiff is full already. Wait here till to-morrow.
We will ferry you over early in the morning.
Mikyllos. It is a crime, Charon, for you to
leave a dead man behind who is stale already. I
will indict you before Rhadamanthos for illegal
practices.
Alas, alack! they are off already, and I shall
be left here alone. But why not swim after
them? I am not afraid of giving out and
drowning, because I am dead already. Moreover, I have not even got the obol to pay the
ferryman.
Klotho. What are you doing? Stay where you
are, Mikyllos. It is not permitted to cross in
that fashion.
Mikyllos. And yet I may possibly get into port
before you do.

Klotho. Heaven forbid. Come up with him

Charon. Now, where shall he sit? Every seat
is full, as you see.
Hermes. On the despot's shoulders, if you agree.
Klotho. Happy thought, Hermes.
Charon. Climb up, then, and set your foot on
the villain's neck; and a fair voyage to us!
Kyniskos. Charon, it is fair to tell you the
truth from this moment. I should not have an
obol to pay you when I have got across, for I
have nothing but this wallet, which you see, and
this club. But if you want any baling done, I
am ready, or even to take an oar. You will have
no fault to find if only you give me a strong, wellbalanced oar.
Charon. Row, then; for even that is payment
enough from you.
Kyniskos. Is it, or must I start a boat-song to
give the time?
Charon. By all means, if you know some sailor's
song.
Kyniskos. I know a number; but see, these
others are wailing tearfully in opposition. They
will put us out in our singing.
First Dead Man. Alas for my goods!
Second Dead Man. Alas for my fields!
Third Dead Man. Woe is me, what a house I
have left!

Fourth Dead Man. How many thousands my

Fifth Dead Man. Alas for my young children!
Sixth Dead Man. Who will gather
grapes from
the vines I planted for myself last year?
Hermes. Mikyllos, do you make no lament?
It is impious for any one to cross without a tear.
Mikyllos. Nonsense. I have nothing to lament
for on a prosperous voyage.
Hermes. Still, just join a little in the groaning
for custom's sake.
Mikyllos. I will make my moan, then, since
you think best, Hermes. Alas for my soles!
Alas for my old lasts! Woe is me for my rotten
sandals! Poor wretch, I shall never again go
without food from daybreak to nightfall! Never
again shall I stalk about in winter barefoot and
half naked, my teeth chattering with the cold!
Who, pray tell, will have my knife and my awl ?
Hermes. You have mourned enough; we have
almost finished our voyage.
Charon. Come, pay me the ferry-charge first!
-Give me yours, too. Now they have all paid.
-Pay me your obol, too, Mikyllos.
Mikyllos. You are joking, Charon, or else your
accounts are writ in water, as they say, if you expect any obol from Mikyllos. I absolutely do
not know whether an obol is four-sided or round.
Charon. This is a fine, profitable voyage to-day!

However, take yourselves ashore. I am going
after the horses and cows and dogs and other
animals, for they, too, must needs cross now.
Klotho. Take them and conduct them, Hermes. I myself must sail to the other shore, to
bring over Indopatris and Eraminthe, the Seres.
They are already dead just now from fighting
with each other about the boundaries of their
territories.
Hermes. Let us proceed, friends, or, rather, all
follow me in order.
Mikyllos. Goodness, how dark it is. Where
now is the handsome Megillos? Or how can any
one tell here whether Simmiche is more beautiful
than Phryne? All things are equal and of the
same complexion, and there are no such things
as degrees of beauty. Even my threadbare cloak,
which always used to seem hideous to me, is now
just as good as the king's purple, for they are
both invisible and covered by the same darkness.
Kyniskos, where may you happen to be?
Kyniskos. Here I am.
gether, if agreeable to you.
Mikyllos. By all means.
Give me your arm.
Tell me, is not this much the same sort of thing
as the Eleusinian mysteries-for of course you
have been initiated?
Let us stroll on to-
Kyniskos. You are right. See, now, this person
advancing with a torch, looking fiercely and


<pb n="138"/>



threateningly about her. I wonder whether it is
an Erinnys?
Mikyllos. Probably, from the look of her dress.
Hermes. Receive these people, Tisiphone-a
thousand and four.
Tisiphone. Indeed, Rhadamanthos here has
been waiting for you a long time.
Rhadamanthos. Bring them forward, Erinnys.
You, Hermes, officiate as herald and summon
them.
Kyniskos. Rhadamanthos, in the name of your
father, produce me and examine me first.
Rhadamanthos. Why?
Kyniskos. I have a great desire to accuse some
one of the evil deeds I know he committed in
his lifetime, and my testimony would not be
worthy of credence unless it has first been shown
what my character is and how I passed my life.
Rhadamanthos. And who are you?
Kyniskos. Kyniskos, my good sir, of the philosophical persuasion.
Rhadamanthos. Come here and stand your trial
first. Hermes, call for the accusers.
Hermes. If any one accuses Kyniskos, the defendant, let him come forward.
Kyniskos. No one comes.
Rhadamanthos. But this is not enough, Kyniskos. Take off your clothes, so that I may judge
you by your brands.


<pb n="139"/>

THE FERRY.
139
Kyniskos. How should I be a branded slave?
Rhadamanthos. Every evil deed that one of you
commits in his life brands invisible marks on his
soul.
Kyniskos. Here I stand stripped, so look for
these brands you talk about.
Rhadamanthos. He is spotless from head to
foot, except for these three or four blurred and
very indistinct brands. But what is this? Here
are the prints and traces of many burnings, but
they have been washed out somehow, or rather
cut out. What do these mean, Kyniskos, and
how is it that you look spotless again?
Kyniskos. I will tell you. I used to be wicked
because I was ignorant, and won many a brand
by this means. But as soon as I began to take
to philosophy, I washed off, little by little, all the
stains from my soul, by the use of this so excellent and effectual medicine.
Rhadamanthos. I dismiss you to the islands of
the blest, to the society of the noblest, after you
have accused the despot you mention.
Summon the others.
Mikyllos. My case, too, Rhadamanthos, is a
trifling one, and calls for a short inquiry. I am
stripped for you already, so examine me.
Rhadamanthos. Who may you be?
Mikyllos. Mikyllos, the shoemaker.
Rhadamanthos. Well done, Mikyllos; you are


<pb n="140"/>



perfectly spotless and unmarked. You, too, I
dismiss along with Kyniskos here. Now summon
the tyrants.
Hermes. Let Megapenthes, son of Lakydes,
appear. Which way are you turning? Come
forward. I am summoning you, the despot.
Shove him out, Tisiphone, head-foremost into
the middle.
Rhadamanthos. But you, Kyniskos, accuse him
now and expose him utterly, for the man is at
hand as defendant.
Kyniskos. There is no need of words at all, for
you will very speedily know him for what he is
from his brands. However, I, too, will unveil
the man for you and exhibit him still more plainly
by what I say. The deeds this accursed wretch
committed while he was a private citizen I think
it best to omit; but when he banded himself
with the most daring spirits and collected a bodyguard, and, revolting, imposed himself on the
State as a tyrant, he slew thousands without trial,
and by taking possession of their property amassed
enormous wealth, and left no form of excess untried. No; he treated the wretched citizens with
every sort of insolence. He seduced the maidens,
debauched the young men, and bore himself in
every way offensively to his subjects. And you
could not even punish him adequately for his
suspicion, his vanity, and his overbearing manner


<pb n="141"/>

to those who happened in his way, for a man
would more easily have looked at the sun without
winking than at him. And who could describe
his inventiveness in the way of punishments to
gratify his cruelty? He did not keep his hands.
off even his next of kin. And you will know immediately that these things are not an empty
slander against him if you summon those that
were murdered by him. In fact, they are here
unbidden, as you see, crowding about him and
throttling him. All these, Rhadamanthos, died
by the wretch's hand. Some he plotted against
for the sake of their beautiful wives. Some gave
way to anger at his insolence when their sons
were led astray. Some died because they were
rich, and some because they were honest and
well-conducted, and in no way complacent of his
actions.
Rhadamanthos. Enough already of witnesses!
But strip him of his purple, too, so that we may
know how many brand-marks he has. Dear me,
he is perfectly livid and covered with marks, or,
rather, he is black and blue with them. Now,
how should he be punished? Shall we cast him
into the fiery stream or hand him over to Kerberos?
Kyniskos. Not at all, but, with your permission,
I will suggest a new and fitting punishment for
him.


<pb n="142"/>



Rhadamanthos. Speak; I shall be deeply grateful to you.
Kyniskos. It is the custom, I believe, for all,
when they die, to drink of the water of Lethe.
Rhadamanthos. Certainly.
Kyniskos. Then let him alone of all men have
no taste of it?
Rhadamanthos. Why?
Kyniskos. In this way he will undergo the
worst punishment, remembering what he was and
what power he had on earth, and pondering on
his lost splendors.
Rhadamanthos. You are right. Let him be
sentenced and carried off and bound along with
Tantalos, remembering the deeds he did while
he was alive.

Athletes and those who pay attention to bodily training do not bestow
all their care on securing a vigorous
condition or on active exercise. They
give some of it to the question of
seasonable relaxation; in fact, they conceive this
to be a very important part of their training. In
just the same way I believe it to be fitting for
those engaged with literature to relax their minds
after a prolonged reading of the more weighty
authors, and render them more vigorous for subsequent labor. And this period of relaxation.
would be more profitable for such persons if they
should spend it over works which do not merely
furnish pastime by their wit and charm, but which
exhibit also some clever train of thought. This
is the ideal I propose to myself for the following
pages. For the novelty of the idea and the charm
of the subject will not be their only attraction,
nor yet the persuasive, consistent way in which
I set forth lies of all sorts, but the fact that each
of the events I record is a parody of some of the
poets and historians and philosophers of antiquity, who wrote such wonderful and fabulous his-
10


<pb n="146"/>



tories. I would even insert their names if they
were not going to disclose themselves to your
own mind as you read.
Ktesias, the Knidian, son of Ktesiochos, wrote
an account of the countries of the Indians and
their manners and customs, which he never saw
himself or heard of from any one else. And Iambulus, too, wrote an astonishing account of things
in the Atlantic Ocean. It is patent to all that he
drew on his imagination, but he carried out his
design pleasantly enough. Many other writers,
too, have chosen the same subjects and written
on them, assuming to give an account of their
own wanderings and journeys, and the size of
the beasts they saw, and the savagery of the people and their strange ways of life. The founder
of the sect, the teacher of all this tomfoolery, was
Homer's Odysseus, who talked to Alkinous and
his people about the servitude of the winds; and
one-eyed people who eat raw flesh and live barbarously; yes, and of creatures with a plurality
of heads, and of transformations wrought on his
companions by drugs. Any amount of such marvels he described to the Phaeacians, as if they
were greenhorns.
Now, when I fell in with all these works, I did
not greatly blame the men for their lying, because
I saw at once that this was the habit of those
even who promise to write philosophy. But the


<pb n="147"/>

147
one thing that filled me with wonder at them was
that they believed their falsifications undetected.
Accordingly, I too, since my vanity made me
eager to leave something for posterity, was not
going to be the only one without a share in the
story-teller's license, and as I had nothing true to
relate for I have had no experiences worth telling-I turned myself to lying far more consistently than the others. For the one true statement I shall make is this: that everything I say
will be a lie. In this way I think I should even
escape the arraignment of others, since I admit
myself that there is not a true word in what I say.
Well, then, my book deals with things I neither
saw nor lived through myself, nor learned from
others things, moreover, which absolutely do not
exist, nor could possibly. Wherefore my readers
must put no manner of trust in them.
I once made a voyage, setting forth from the
Pillars of Hercules into the Western Ocean, with
a following wind. The cause of my journey and
my object in making it were the restless curiosity
of my mind, a yearning for novelties, and a desire
to learn what is the boundary of the ocean, and
what sort of people dwell on the other side. To
this end I stored a ship with a great quantity of
provisions, put plenty of water, too, aboard, secured fifty of my comrades who were of my way
of thinking, laid in, moreover, a good stock of


<pb n="148"/>



weapons, furnished myself with an excellent ship's
master at high wages, and had the vessel—she
was a light-built, fast-sailing craft — put in repair
as though for a long, hard voyage.
Well, we sailed for a day and a night with a
favorable wind, still in sight of land and making
no great progress. But as the sun rose on the
next day the wind increased, the sea rose, it grew
dark, and it became impossible even to take in
the sails. Accordingly, we surrendered ourselves
to the wind, and were storm-tossed for seventynine days; but on the eightieth the sun suddenly
shone out, and we perceived an island at no great
distance, high and wooded, with no fierce breakers
thundering about it, for the sea had already greatly subsided. So we brought the ship to land and
disembarked, and for some time we lay on the
ground, as was natural after our long distress.
But when we had got upon our feet we chose out
thirty of our number to stay and guard the ship,
and twenty to go inland with me and reconnoitre
the island.
When we had advanced as much as six hundred yards from the sea through the woods we
saw a pillar of wrought brass, bearing an inscription in Greek characters, blurred and rubbed
away, which read: "Herakles and Dionysos came
to this point." And there were two footprints in
the rock close by--one a hundred feet long, the


<pb n="149"/>

A TRUE HISTORY.
149
other smaller. I have no doubt that one of them,
the smaller, was left by Dionysos, the other by
Herakles. We paid our devotions and went forward. We had not gone far when we came to a
river flowing with wine-more like the wine of
Chios than any other. The stream was full and
wide, so that in some places it was navigable.
So it came home to us more than ever that we
must believe the legend on the pillar when we
saw these signs of Dionysos's passage that way.
I made up my mind to explore the source of the
river and ascended along the stream; but I
found no spring, only a quantity of great vines
full of grapes, with a drop of translucent wine
trickling from the root of each, and from these
the river took its rise. There were also a quantity of fish to be seen in it, very like wine in color and taste. In fact we got drunk from eating
some of them that we caught, and we actually
found them full of lees when we cut them open.
Later, however, we bethought ourselves of the
other sort of fish that live in water, and by mixing
the two we mitigated the strength of our wine
food. We took some jars, and laid in a supply of
water and of wine, too, from the river, and having
encamped near it on the beach for the night, we
set sail at daybreak with a gentle breeze. But
about noonday, when we had lost sight of the
island, a whirlwind suddenly arose, spun the ship


<pb n="150"/>



around, lifted her four hundred miles in the air,
and did not set her back in the sea again; but as
she was hanging aloft in the air a wind struck the
sails, filled the canvas, and bore her on. For
seven days and as many nights we coursed
through the air, and on the eighth we saw a great
earth in the air like an island, bright and round,
and shining with a great light. We made for it,
came to anchor, and went ashore. On examining
the country we found it inhabited and cultivated.
By day we could see nothing from it, but when
night came on many other islands appeared in
the neighborhood, some larger and some smaller,
of the color of fire, and a certain other earth below them with cities on it, and rivers and seas and
forests and mountains. This we judged was our
own.
We determined to go still farther into the interior, but we met some of the Hippogyps, as they
call themselves, and they arrested us. These
Hippogyps are men riding on great vultures,
using the birds like horses, for the vultures are
large and for the most part three-headed. You
may understand their size from this: each of their
feathers is longer and thicker than the mast of a
good-sized merchantman. Now it was the business of our Hippogyps to fly about the country,
and, if they found a stranger, bring him to the
king. Accordingly, they took us in charge and


<pb n="151"/>

A TRUE HISTORY.
151
brought us to him.
When he had looked at us,
he said: "I see, strangers, that you are Greeks.”
For he judged from our appearance and clothing.
Upon our replying that we were, he asked:
"How, then, have you come hither, traversing
such a waste of air?"
We told him our whole story, and then he began in turn and told us about himself: how he,
too, was a man, Endymion by name, and had
once been snatched up from our earth in his
sleep, and, arriving here, had become king of the
country. He said that this earth was what appeared to us below to be the moon. But he bade
us take heart and suspect no danger, for we should
have everything we wanted.
"If," said he, "I bring to a successful issue
the war I am now waging against the inhabitants
of the Sun, you will find this the pleasantest place
of residence in the universe."
We asked who the enemy were and what was
the matter in dispute.
66
Phaeton," said he, "the king of the Sun-folk
-for the Sun is inhabited as well as the Moonhas been at war with us for a long time already.
It began from this cause: I had collected the
poorest of my subjects and planned to send them
off to colonize the Morning-star, which is a wilderness, uninhabited by any one. Now Phaeton,
in his jealousy, stopped the colonists, meeting


<pb n="152"/>



them half-way on their journey with his Antcavalry. On that occasion we were beaten—
for our numbers were not equal to theirs-and
we retired, but now I want to march out again
and convoy the colonists. So, if it be agreeable
to you, join my expedition. I will furnish you
with a vulture apiece from the royal stables and
the rest of your equipment. We shall set out tomorrow."
"We are at your service," said I. He then invited us to supper, and we spent the night with
him.
[Here follows a detailed account of the extraordinary troops marshalled by Endymion and
Phaeton, and the manner in which the battle was
fought, the Moonites defeated, and the hero taken
prisoner with two of his companions. The victorious Sun-folk built a wall between their country
and the Moon, cutting off the sunlight, so that
Endymion's people were forced to sue for peace,
which was granted on easy terms, the chief stipulations being that the Moon should pay a yearly
tribute of a hundred thousand gallons of dew,
and that the Morning-star should be settled by
colonists from the Sun as well as the Moon, and
any one else who cared to join them.]
Such were the terms of the peace. The wall
was forthwith torn down, and we prisoners-of-war
were surrendered. On our return to the Moon


<pb n="153"/>

A TRUE HISTORY.
153
our comrades and Endymion himself came out
to meet us, and embraced us with tears; and he
asked me to stay there and join his colony, promising to give me his own child in marriage. However, I by no means listened to him, but begged
him to convey me down into the sea again; and
when he saw it was impossible to move me he
sent us off after feasting us for seven days.
Then, after making our adieux to the king and
his people, we embarked and set sail. On me
Endymion also bestowed some gifts, two of their
crystal tunics, five bronze ones, and a suit of beanarmor-all of which I left in the whale. He sent
also a thousand Hippogyps to escort us fifty miles.
On our voyage we sailed past a number of
places, and put in at the Morning-star, which we
had just helped to colonize, and disembarked and
took in water. Going aboard again we made off
into the Zodiac on the left, all but touching the
Sun as we sailed past. We did not go ashore,
though many of my mates were eager to, for the
wind did not permit it. However, we saw the
country, which was blooming, rich, well-watered,
and full of all pleasant things. When the Cloudcentaurs, who are mercenaries of Phaeton, saw us,
they flew towards the ship; but, on learning that
we were allies, they withdrew. The Hippogyps,
too, had already left us.

After sailing all the next night and day we arrived towards evening at what is called Lamptown, having already entered upon our downward
course. This city lies between the tracts of the
Pleiades and the Hyades, a good deal lower than
the Zodiac. Here we disembarked, but we found
no human being, only a multitude of lamps running about and transacting business in the market-place and on the wharves. Some were small,
the lower classes, as it were; but a few were large
and of high rank, and these were brilliant, and
could be seen afar. Each of them had his own
private residence or lantern, and a name, like a
man, and we heard them utter speech. They offered us no injury, but even invited us to be their
guests. Still we were afraid of them, and not one
of us dared either to sit at table or pass the night
with them. They have erected a palace in the
midst of the city, and there the ruler sits all night,
calling on each by name. If any one does not
respond, he is condemned to death as having deserted his post. Death with them is to be extinguished. We were present and saw what happened, and heard the lamps defending themselves
and explaining the reasons for their tardiness.
There I recognized also the lamp from our house,
and, addressing him, asked him how things were
going on at home, and he gave me a full account.
We spent that one night there, and the next

day we put out to sea again, being already nearer
the clouds. And there we saw Cloudcuckootown (to our amazement), but we did not put in,
as the wind was in the wrong direction. But
Crow, son of Blackbird, was said to be on the
throne, and I bethought me of Aristophanes the
poet, a grave man and truthful, and one whose
writings have been unworthily discredited.
On the third day thereafter we also got plain
sight of the ocean, but no land was anywhere to
be seen save those islands in the air, and they
had already taken on a fiery, dazzling look. On
the fourth day, about noon, the wind fell gently
and subsided, and we sank onto the sea. When
we touched the water it was wonderful to see the
excesses of our joy and delight. We made what
cheer our means would allow, and sprang overboard and swam about, for there happened to be
a calm and the sea was quiet. But a change for
the better seems to be often the beginning of
greater evils, and so it was in our case. For two
days only we sailed with fine weather, and at daybreak, on the third, just before sunrise, we suddenly sighted a great number of sea-monsters
and whales, with one among them bigger than all
the rest, a hundred and seventy miles long. It
came on with its mouth yawning open, making
wide commotion in the sea, scattering foam in all
directions, and showing its great teeth. They


<pb n="156"/>



were all as sharp as pickets and white as ivory.
Well, we said our last farewells, embraced each
other, and waited. The creature was already
alongside, and swallowed us down at a gulp, ship
and all. However, it did not close its teeth in
time to crush us, but the ship slipped in through
the openings.
When we were within, all was dark at first,
and we saw nothing; but presently the creature
opened its mouth, and we beheld a great cavern,
so broad in all directions and so high that it
might have held a city of ten thousand souls. In
the midst lay the fragments of small fish and other animals, sails of ships, anchors, human bones,
and merchandise; and down the middle there
was dry land, with hills formed, I suppose, by the
settling of the mud the creature drank down. At
all events, there were woods on it, and plants of
all sorts grew there and vegetables had sprung
up, so that it was in all respects like tilled soil.
The circumference of the land was twenty-seven
miles. We could also see sea-fowl, gulls, and
halcyons building nests in the trees.
Well, at first we wept a long time, but by-andby I roused my comrades and we propped the
ship. Then we rubbed dry sticks together and
made a fire, and cooked a meal of anything we
could lay our hands on. There was an abundance
of fish at hand of all sorts, and we still had some
1

A TRUE HISTORY.
157
of the water we had laid in at the Morning-star.
Next morning when we arose, every time the
whale opened its mouth we saw now land, now
mountains, now sky alone, and often islands. By
this we perceived the creature was rushing swiftly
through all parts of the sea.
When we had already grown accustomed to this
manner of life, I took seven of my companions
and made my way into the forest, wishing to explore it thoroughly. I had not gone a thousand
yards before I came upon a temple dedicated to
Poseidon, as the inscription showed, and shortly
after a number of graves with headstones, and
near by a spring of clear water. Moreover, we
heard the barking of a dog, and perceived smoke
rising in the distance, so that we judged there
must be a habitation of some sort. Accordingly,
we hastened our steps, and came upon an old
man and a young one working very industriously
in a garden-plot, and watering it with water from
the spring. We halted, overjoyed, and at the
same time filled with fear, and they must have
had the same feeling towards us, for they stood
speechless.
But presently the old man said, "Who are you,
strangers? Are you," said he, "some of the gods
of the sea, or ill-fated mortals like ourselves?
For we are men, and we were reared on dry land;
but now we have become sea-dwellers, and we


<pb n="158"/>



swim about in company with this monster who
encloses us, not rightly knowing what condition
we are in; for reason tells us we are dead, and
yet we believe we are alive."
In answer to this I, too, spoke: "We, too, are
men, father-new-comers, at your service. We
were gulped down, the other day, ship and all.
We are making this expedition for the sake of
knowing what is in the forest, for it seemed large
and thickly wooded. Some god, I think, led us,
so that we might see you, and know that we are
not the only men penned up in this monster.
But come, tell us your story-who you are and
how you came hither."
But he said he would neither give nor seek information until he had offered us such hospitality
as was in his power; so he took possession of us
and led us to his dwelling, which was tolerably
made, with beds built in it and furnished with the
other necessaries. He set before us vegetables
and fruits and fish, and poured out wine for us,
too; and when we had eaten our fill, he inquired
what our adventures had been. I related them
all in order-the storm, our experiences on the
island, our voyage in the air, the war, everything
up to our engulfment by the whale. He was
greatly astonished, and in turn gave us an account
of his own fortunes.
"By birth, friends, I am a Cypriote. Being en-

gaged in commerce, I set out from my
native land
with my boy, whom you see, and a number of
slaves as well, and sailed for Italy, carrying a
cargo of all sorts of wares in a large ship, which
you perhaps saw lying in fragments at the whale's
mouth. Well, as far as Sicily we had a favorable
voyage, but there a tempest fell upon us and drove
us three days out to sea, where we fell in with the
whale and were swallowed bodily. We two alone
were saved; all the others perished. We buried
our comrades and built the temple to Poseidon,
and then we fell into our present mode of life, tilling our kitchen-garden, and eating fish and fruits.
The forest, as you see, is extensive, and there are
actually quantities of grapes in it, which make the
sweetest wine. The spring, too, which perhaps
you know, gives very clear and cold water. We
make our bed of leaves; we have no lack of fire;
we capture the birds that fly in; we take alive the
fish that find their way into the monster's gills;
and there, too, we bathe when we wish. There is
a salt lake, also, not far off, more than two miles
in circumference, stocked with fish of all sorts.
There we swim and sail, too, in a small skiff that
I built myself. This is the twenty-seventh year
since we were swallowed. As far as these
things go, our life was perhaps tolerable; but
our neighbors, the people who live near us,
are extremely rough and violent, for they are sav-

ages who have never had commerce with civilization."
"What!" said I, "are there, then, still other
men in the whale ?"
"Numbers of them," said he, "inhospitable
and barbarous in their manners. The western territory towards the tail is inhabited by the Driedherring folk, an eel-eyed, lobster-faced race, warlike, fierce, and eaters of raw flesh. On the other
side, towards the right, are the Triton-weasels,
who are like men above but like weasels below.
However, they are less unruly than the others.
On the left are the Crabclaws and the Tunnyheads, who have made a friendly alliance between
themselves. The country between is inhabited by
the Crayfish and the Skaitfeet, a warlike race and
very swift in running. The eastern part towards
the mouth consists of waste deserts washed by
the sea. But this region I hold, paying the Skaitfeet a yearly tribute of five hundred oysters.
Such is the nature of the country; it is for you to
see to it that we may be able to hold our own
in war with so many tribes and get our living."
"What are their numbers in all ?" said I.
"More than a thousand," he replied.
"And what arms have they?"
"None," said he, "except fish-bones."
"Very well, then," I said; "it would be best to
engage them in battle, for they are unarmed and

we are armed. If we overcome them we shall
dwell without fear of molestation for the future."
This course was determined on, and we went
back to the ship and made ourselves ready. The
day for paying the tribute was at hand, and we
were going to make a refusal to pay it the ground
of war.
Sure enough, the savages sent messengers to demand the tribute, but our friends answered them scornfully and chased them away.
The Skaitfeet and the Crayfish were the first to
advance, furious with Skintharos-for that was
his name—and making a great noise. But we had
suspected their attack, and awaited them fully
armed, having sent forward an ambuscade of
twenty-five men. The order given to the men in
ambush was that when they perceived the enemy
had passed by they should spring out, and this
is what they did. Springing out, they fell upon
them from the rear; and we ourselves, who were
also twenty-five in number (for Skintharos and his
son fought with us), met them in front and joined
battle, fighting desperately with might and main ;
and finally we put them to flight and chased
them to their caves. The enemy lost one hundred and seventy men; we lost one, and the pilot
was wounded in the back with the rib of a mullet.
That day and night we encamped on the battle-field, and raised a trophy by fixing the dried
spine of a dolphin upright. But the next day all

the others who had learned what was going on
presented themselves. The Driedherrings were on
the right wing, with Pelamos in command, the Tunnyheads were on the left, and the Crabclaws occupied the centre. The Triton-weasels remained
neutral, not choosing to join either side. We took
the initiative, advanced to meet them, and engaged with a great shout close by the temple of
Poseidon. The hollow chamber echoed our cry
as if it had been a cavern. We routed them, unarmed as they were, and chasing them into the
depths of the forest, made ourselves masters of
the rest of the country. Soon after they sent
messengers, who gathered up their dead and
discussed an alliance; but we decided not to
treat with them. On the contrary, we marched
against them next day, and literally cut them to
pieces, with the exception of the Triton-weasels.
These, when they saw what had happened, rushed
out through the gills and threw themselves into
the sea.
We marched into the country, stripped
already of enemies, and dwelt securely thereafter,
instituting exercises of various sorts and hunting; and we cultivated the vines, and gathered
the fruits from the trees, and were in every respect like well-fed prisoners left at large in a
great prison, from which escape was impossible.
We lived in this fashion for a year and eight
months; but on the fifth day of the ninth month

A TRUE HISTORY.

I rose at about the second yawning of the whale
-for he opened his mouth once in every hour,
so that we reckoned our time by it—well, about
the second yawning, as I said, a sudden great
uproar was heard, and what sounded like the
commands of officers and the rhythmic cry of
rowers. Startled, as you may suppose, we crept
up to the very mouth of the monster, and standing inside the teeth, we beheld the most amazing
sight I ever saw-namely, giants a hundred yards
tall, sailing towards one another on huge islands
as if they were triremes. Now I know that what
I am going to recount will seem highly incredible, nevertheless I shall tell it.
The islands were long, but not particularly
high, and each was as much as twelve miles in
circumference. About twenty-eight of the giants
sailed on each, part of them seated in order on
either side, and rowing with great pine-treesbranches, leaves and all—for oars. Aft, as if on
the poop, stood the pilot on a high hill, handling
a bronze rudder five hundred yards long. At the
prow stood as many as forty in armor, fighting.
They were like men in all respects save their
hair, but that was of flaming fire, so that they had
no need of helmets. They had no sails, but the
wind, striking against the trees, which grew in
forests on each, filled them, and drove the island
whithersoever the pilot wished. A boatswain


<pb n="164"/>



stood over the rowers to give them their time, and
the islands moved quickly at his order like so
many great ships.
At first we saw only two or three islands, but
afterwards as many as six hundred appeared,
ranged themselves in opposition, and began a
naval battle. Many dashed against each other's
prows, many were run into and sunk, but some
grappled and fought vigorously, and could not
easily be shaken off, for the warriors at the prow
showed the greatest spirit in boarding the other
vessel and killing her men, but no one took a
prisoner alive. Instead of grappling-irons they
threw great polyps, fastened one to another.
These entangled themselves in the trees and so
held the island itself. Their missiles and weapons were oysters large enough to fill a cart and
sponges thirty yards round. The commander on
one side was Fleetfoot, on the other Sea-Drinker.
The cause of the battle appeared to be a dispute
about plunder, for Sea-Drinker was said to have
driven off many herds of dolphins belonging to
Fleetfoot, as we could hear from what they shouted to one another, and in the same way we learned
the names of the kings.
Finally, Fleetfoot and his party were victorious, and they sank about a hundred and fifty
of the enemy's islands and captured three more
with their crews, but the others backed water and

165
fled. The victors gave chase for a while, but
when evening had fallen they returned to where
the débris floated, took possession of most of the
enemies' belongings and recovered their own;
for not less than eighty of their own islands had
sunk. They also raised a trophy in honor of the
victory on the whale's head, by setting one of the
enemy's islands on a post. That night they encamped round the whale, floating close by, having
fastened their hawsers and anchors to him, for
they had anchors, too-large ones made of glass
and very strong. The next day they sacrificed
on the whale, buried their comrades on him, and
sailed off rejoicing and apparently singing a song
of victory. Such are the details of the island
engagement.
Book 11.
FROM this time our life in the whale became
insupportable to me; I chafed against our imprisonment, and sought some device that would
make escape possible. My first idea was to dig
through the right side and make our way out, and
we began the excavation. But when we had advanced as much as a thousand yards and accomplished nothing, we gave over digging, and decided to set fire to the forest, for this would kill the


<pb n="166"/>



whale, and if he should die we could easily get
out. Accordingly, we set fire to it, beginning from
the tail, and for seven days and as many nights
he paid no attention to the burning. But on the
eighth and ninth days we saw he felt ill—at least
he opened his mouth more languidly, and when
he did open it, shut it again on the instant. On
the tenth and eleventh days he grew rigid, and
began to smell. On the twelfth we perceived
just in time that, unless we propped his teeth
open when he yawned so that they could not
close again, we were in danger of being shut up
in the corpse and perishing with him. When we
had accordingly propped the mouth open with
great beams we got the ship ready, and put in as
much water as we could and the other provisions.
Skintharos was to be captain.
Next day the whale died. We dragged the ship
up, guided it through the openings between the
teeth, and lowering it by ropes attached to them,
sank gently into the sea. We disembarked on
the whale's back, sacrificed to Poseidon, and encamped there three days beside the trophy, for
there was no wind. On the third day we sailed
away. In the neighborhood we fell in with a
number of bodies from the sea-fight. We pushed
our way through them, and took their measure
with amazement.
For some days we sailed with a temperate wind;


<pb n="167"/>

A TRUE HISTORY.
167
but then it came on to blow violently from the
north, a great frost prevailed, and the whole sea
froze, not on the surface only, but to a depth of
four hundred fathoms, so that we could disembark
and run on the ice. But as the wind continued
and we were no longer able to endure it, we devised the following plan-Skintharos was the author of it: We dug a great cave in the ice, and
there we dwelt for thirty days, building a fire and
living on fish, which we found by digging. When
at last our food failed we came out, and hauled
the frozen ship out of the ice. Then we spread
the sails and swept along as if we were sailing,
gliding smoothly and gently over the ice. On the
fifth day it grew warm, the ice melted, and everything became water again. After we had sailed
as much as thirty-four miles we touched at a small
uninhabited island, where we took in water-for
ours had already given out-and shot two wild
bulls, and set sail again. These bulls did not
have their horns on their foreheads but beneath
their eyes, as Momos thought they ought to be.
Shortly after we entered a sea, not of water, but
of milk, and we sighted a white island in it covered with vines. This island was an enormous
cheese, very compact, as we learned later by eating of it. It was three miles in circumference.
The vines were full of grapes; but it was milk, not
wine, that we squeezed from them and drank.


<pb n="168"/>



There was a temple in the middle of the island
erected to Galatea the Nereid, as we learned from
the inscription. As long as we stayed there
the earth supplied us with food, both substantial and light, and for drink we had the milk
from the grapes. Tyro, daughter of Salmoneus, was said to be queen of these parts, having been thus honored by Poseidon after her
death.
We stayed five days in the island, and set sail
on the sixth with a favorable wind and a smooth
sea. On the eighth day, when we had sailed out
of the milk and into salt, blue water, we perceived
a number of persons running on the sea, like ourselves in every detail of body and stature, except
only their feet, for these were of cork. I suppose
that is why they were called Corkfeet. We were
astonished when we saw they did not sink, but
skimmed over the waves and serenely pursued
their course. They approached us and even greeted us, and told us in Greek that they were hurrying to Cork, their native land. Accordingly, they
accompanied us some distance, running alongside; then they turned from our course and went
off, wishing us a fair voyage. Shortly after we
sighted a number of islands, among them Cork,
whither they were hastening. It was near us on
the left hand, and was a city set on a high round
cork. Farther on, and more to the right, were


<pb n="169"/>

A TRUE HISTORY.
169
five very large, high islands, with great fires blazing up from them.
But off our bow there lay a single island, broad
and low, not less than sixty miles in extent. As
soon as we came near it a wonderful air breathed
about us, sweet and fragrant, such an odor as the
historian Herodotus says comes from Araby the
Blest. It was like the fragrance of roses and
narcissus and hyacinths and lilies and violets,
with myrtle and laurel and grape-blossoms added, such a sweetness it was that fell upon us. As
this fragrance reached our senses and raised in
us hopes of the best of fortune after our long
distresses, we drew little by little nearer to the
island. Then we perceived that it was girt with
harbors where no waves broke, and that great,
clear rivers rolled quietly into the sea. We saw
meadows, too, and woods, and tuneful birds, some
singing on the beach and many more in the
branches. And the land was steeped in a light,
gentle-breathing air. Certain sweet breezes blew
softly through the wood and shook it, and even
the branches as they moved gave forth a pleasant, continuous sound like the strains of flutes
left hanging in the trees. There was a sound,
too, of many mingled voices, not discordant, but
such as you would hear at a banquet when the
flutes are heard and some of the guests speak
out their praise, and some applaud with their


<pb n="170"/>

170.

hands, in accord with the flute or the cither.
Enchanted by all this we ran our ship in, anchored her, and went ashore, leaving Skintharos
and two of our comrades aboard.
As we were advancing through the flowery
meadows we came upon the sentinels and coastguards, who bound us with garlands of roses
for these are the heaviest bonds they use-and
led us before the ruler. On the road we learned
from them that this was called the Island of the
Blest, ruled by Rhadamanthos of Krete. When
we were brought into his presence our case was
the fourth in order for decision. The first was
that of Telamonian Ajax, to decide whether or
not it was fitting for him to dwell with the heroes.
The charge against him was that he had slain
himself in frenzy. At last, after much debate,
Rhadamanthos decided thus: for the present he
was to be handed over to Hippokrates of Kos,
the doctor, to drink hellebore, and afterwards,
when he should have regained his senses, he
was to be admitted to the feasts of the heroes.
-
The second was a sentimental case, in which
Theseus and Menelaos disputed which had a
right to Helen. Rhadamanthos decided that she
belonged to Menelaos, because he had undergone
such toils and dangers on account of his marriage with her. And he pointed out that Theseus.

171
on the other hand, had other wives, the Amazon
and the daughters of Minos.
The third case was a question of precedence
between Alexander, son of Philip, and Hannibal
the Carthaginian. It was decided that the pas
belonged to Alexander, and a chair was set for
him beside Cyros the Elder, of Persia.
As the fourth case we were brought forward.
He asked what circumstances had brought us,
still living men, within sacred precincts, and we
told him the whole story in order. He then sent
us aside for some time and considered our case,
discussing it with his colleagues; for many others were on the bench with him, and among them
Aristides the Just, of Athens. He announced his
decision as follows: we were to pay, after death,
the penalty for our curiosity and our voyage; but
for the period fixed by him we might stay in the
island and dwell with the heroes, and then take
ourselves off. He set the day of our departure at
not more than seven months' distance.
Thereupon the garlands fell from us of their
own accord, leaving us free, and we were led into
the city, and to the banquet-hall of the blest.
The city itself is all of gold, but the wall around
it is of emerald. There were seven gates, each a
single piece of cinnamon. But the streets of the
city and the ground within the walls were ivory.
The temples of all the gods were built of beryll


<pb n="172"/>



stone, and the great altars in them, on which hecatombs are offered, are single amethysts. Around
the city flows a river of the sweetest unguents,
fifty yards broad and twenty-five deep, so that
one may swim in it pleasantly. The baths of
this country are great buildings of crystal filled
with the fragrance of burning cinnamon. But, instead of water, there is warm dew in the pools.
For garments the people wear delicate purple
spiders' webs. They themselves have no bodies;
they are impalpable and fleshless, and present to
the eye nothing but a shape, a contour. But although they are thus disembodied, they yet have
consistency, move, reason, and utter speech. In
fact, it is just as though their naked souls were
walking about, wearing the likeness of their bodies. At any rate, unless you should lay hold of
one of them, you would not detect that what your
eye rested on was incorporeal. They are like
shadows, except that they are upright and not
dark. No one grows old; each remains at the
age he had when he came. Nor is there any
night with them, or very bright day either, for the
light that pervades the land is like that white radiance of dawn before the sun has risen. Moreover, they know only one time of year, for it is
always spring there, and the south wind is the
only one that blows. The country blooms with
all sorts of flowers and of green things, too, culti-

vated plants and shady forest-trees. The vines
bear twelve times a year, bringing forth their
fruit every month. But the pears and apples and
other fruits are said to come thirteen times yearly, for in one month, called there the month of
Minos, the trees bear twice. Instead of grain the
ears bear loaves, ready for eating, on their heads
like mushrooms. There are three hundred and
sixty-five springs of water about the city, as many
more of honey, and five hundred of perfumed oil;
but these are smaller. There are seven rivers of
milk and eight of wine.
The place of their banquets is outside the city,
in what is called the Elysian Field. It is a very
beautiful meadow surrounded by a dense wood
of all sorts of trees, which shade the guests as
they lie beneath them on beds of blossoms. The
winds wait upon the guests and serve them with
everything but wine. This they need not serve,
for surrounding the place are great trees of the
clearest crystal, and the fruits of these trees are
wine-cups of every sort of workmanship and size.
So that, when any one comes to table, he gathers
one or two of the cups and sets them beside him,
and they are straightway filled with wine. This,
then, is the manner of their drinking, and as for
garlands, they have none, but the nightingales
and other tuneful birds gather flowers from the
neighboring meadows in their beaks, and let them


<pb n="174"/>



fall like snow as they fly over the guests, singing the while. And I will tell you how they are
anointed with perfumes. Thick clouds draw up
perfume from the springs and the river; then
they station themselves above the banquet, and
when the winds gently press them they let fall a
light rain like dew.
At the feast they amuse themselves with music
and singing, and their favorites are the songs of
Homer; for he is there in person and feasts with
them, sitting next above Odysseus. The choruses
are composed of youths and maidens, and Eunomos of Lokris, Arion of Lesbos, Anakreon and
Stesichoros conduct them and sing with them.
For Stesichoros, too, I saw there, as Helen had
already made it up with him. When these cease
singing a second chorus comes forward, composed of swans and swallows and nightingales.
As soon as they begin to sing, the whole forest,
set going by the winds, accompanies them on the
flute.
But the greatest incentive they have to good
cheer is this: there are two springs near the
feasting-place, one of laughter and the other of
pleasure. Every one drinks from each of these
at the beginning of the merry-making, and the rest
of the time is spent with pleasure and laughter.
I wish to tell you, also, what famous persons I
saw there. There were all the demi-gods and the


<pb n="175"/>

A TRUE HISTORY.
175
heroes who went on the Trojan expedition, with
the exception of Lokrian Ajax; he, they said,
was being punished in the realm of the wicked.
Among the barbarians there were both the Cyruses, Anacharsis the Scythian, Zamolxis the
Thracian, and Numa the Italian. Sparta was
represented by Lykourgos, and Athens by Phokion, Tellos, and all the sages except Periander.
I also saw Sokrates, son of Sophroniskos, gossipping with Nestor and Palamedes. Round him
were Hyakinthos of Lacedaemon, Narkissos of
Thespiae, Hylas, and many other handsome lads,
and it seemed to me that he was fond of Hyakinthos. At all events, he often put him down in
argument. It was rumored that Rhadamanthos
was out of temper with Sokrates, and had often
threatened to banish him from the island if he
continued his nonsense and was not willing to
stop revelling in his irony. Plato only was not
there, and I was told that he was living himself
in the city he had fashioned, under the constitution and laws with which he endowed it in his
writings.
Aristippos, however, and Epicuros held the
greatest honors there, because they were charming and agreeable and most convivial. Aesop
the Phrygian was there, too, and held the office
of court-jester. Diogenes of Sinope had so altered his ways as to marry Lais, the courtesan,


<pb n="176"/>



and was given to getting up and dancing when
he was drunk, and playing other drunken tricks.
Not one of the Stoics was there, for they were
said to be still climbing the steep hill of "the
higher life." And I heard this of Chrysippos
himself, that it was not permitted to him to come
to the island until he had completed his fourth
course of hellebore-treatment. They said that
the Academics wished to come, but were still suspending their judgment and considering the matter, for they had not yet an apprehension even
of this, whether there be any such island or no.
I imagine they particularly dreaded the judgment
of Rhadamanthos, for by their principles they
deny any standard for forming judgments. They
asserted that many of their number set out to
follow these who actually arrived, but were so
deliberate that they were left behind, and turned
back when they had come half-way. These, then,
were the most noteworthy people there. The
person most looked up to was Achilles, and next
after him Theseus.
Before more than two or three days had passed
I approached Homer, the poet, when we were
both at leisure, and asked him several questions;
among others, what his birthplace was, telling
him that this was a great subject of research
among us to this day. He said he was aware
already that some believe he was born in Chios,


<pb n="177"/>

some in Smyrna, and many in Colophon. He
was, however (he said), a Babylonian, and in his
own country was called not Homer, but Tigranes.
But when later he made his home in Greece as a
hostage he changed his name.
I also asked him about those verses in his
poems rejected by the critics, whether they were
written by him or not, and he declared they were
all his. As you will imagine, this filled me with
contempt for the callous criticism of the commentators Zenodotos and Aristarchos. When he
had satisfied me on these points, I asked what in
the world was his reason for beginning his poem
with the word "wrath." He said that was the
way it came into his head, and he took no pains
about it. I was eager to know this, too: whether
he wrote the Odyssey before the Iliad, as most
critics declare; but he said he did not. As to
that other story about him, that he was blind, I
very soon perceived that it was false, for he saw,
so that there was no need even to put the question. I repeated my action frequently when I saw
him unoccupied, going up to him and interrogating him. He answered me cordially, especially after he had won his lawsuit. An indictment for slander had been brought against him
by Thersites, on the ground of the scoffs against
him in Homer's poems. But Homer won the suit,
having Odysseus as counsel.

During this same time Pythagoras of Samos
also put in an appearance after his seventh transformation, his lives in the forms of as many animals, and his completion of the cycles of the soul.
His whole right thigh was of gold. He was
judged worthy to dwell with the others, but there
was doubt whether he ought to be called Pythagoras or Euphorbos. Empedokles also came,
done to a turn, with his whole body roasted. He,
however, was not admitted, though he begged hard.
Some time after this their games were held in
honor of the Festival of the Dead. Achilles presided for the fifth time and Theseus for the seventh. A full description would be too lengthy,
but I will narrate the most important events.
Karos, of the line of Hercules, won the wrestling
prize, although he had Odysseus for a competitor.
The boxing-match was a tie between Areion the
Egyptian, who is buried in Corinth, and Epeios,
who contended together. For the all-round contest they offer no prize there, and as for the footrace, I no longer remember who was the winner.
Among the poets Homer was easily the real victor, but nevertheless Hesiod won the prize. The
prize for all alike was a wreath woven of peacock's feathers.
Hardly were the games at an end when word
was brought that the criminals who were being
punished in the realm of the wicked had broken

their chains and overpowered the guard, and were
marching against the island. Phalaris of Agrigentum was in command, the report said, with
Busiris the Egyptian, the Thracian Diomede, and
Skeiron and the Pine-bender, with their followers.
When Rhadamanthos heard these tidings he marshalled the heroes on the beach, the commanders
being Theseus, Achilles, and Telamonian Ajax,
who had by this time recovered his wits. The
forces joined battle and the heroes were victorious, owing chiefly to the exploits of Achilles.
Sokrates, too, distinguished himself in the right
wing much more than at the battle of Delium,
while he was living. For when the enemy
advanced he kept his place with unflinching front.
As a reward for his bravery a prize was bestowed
on him later in the shape of a very large and
beautiful garden in the suburbs, where he assembled his followers and conversed with them, calling the place the Academy of the Dead. The
vanquished were collected, of course, and sent
back again in irons to still greater punishments.
Homer wrote an account of this battle, too, and
presented me with a copy on my departure for
me to carry to men in this land, but I lost it afterwards, with my other belongings. The first line
of the poem was this:
66
Sing to me now, O Muse, the wars of the
shades of the heroes."


<pb n="180"/>



Their next proceeding was to cook some beans,
according to their custom after a successful war,
and hold a festival of victory with a great banquet. But Pythagoras alone would not partake.
He sat a distance fasting, and filled with loathing at the eating of beans.
Six months had already gone by and half of
the seventh when a disaster happened. Kinyras,
Skintharos's son, tall and handsome, had for some
time already been in love with Helen, who, on
her side, made no secret of her lively passion for
the youth. At any rate, they were constantly
making signs to one another at table and pledging each other as they drank their wine, and then
they would rise and wander off alone in the forest. Well, at last Kinyras, urged on by his passion and his helpless condition, conceived the
plan of stealing Helen and running off with her.
She, too, approved the idea of going off to one
of the neighboring islands, either Cork or Cheeseland. They had some time ago taken three of
my most valiant comrades into the conspiracy,
but Kinyras had not mentioned it to his father,
for he knew he would hinder him. They carried
out their preconcerted plan. The night came. I
was not at hand, for I happened to be asleep in
the banquet-hall. The conspirators eluded the
others, captured Helen, and set sail in haste.
About midnight Menelaus awoke, and, finding


<pb n="181"/>

his wife gone, he gave the alarm and went with
his brother to the king, Rhadamanthos. At daybreak the watchmen brought word that they could
make out the ship at a great distance. Accordingly Rhadamanthos ordered fifty of the heroes
into a vessel made of a single log of asphodel,
and bade them give chase. They rowed with a
will, and overtook the fugitives towards noon just
as they were entering the sea of milk in the neighborhood of Cheeseland; so near were they to
getting off! They made the ship fast to their
own with a chain of roses and sailed back, Helen
weeping for shame behind her veil. Kinyras
and his followers were first asked by Rhadamanthos whether they had any other accomplices,
and when they said they had not, he bound them,
flogged them with mallows, and sent them off to
the realm of the wicked. They decided that we,
too, must be sent out of the island on short notice,
giving us only the following day. Thereupon I
burst into lamentations and wept at the thought
of leaving so many delights and setting forth on
my wanderings again. But the heroes heartened
me by saying that before many years I should
return to them, and they showed me a chair and
a couch made ready against that day near the
noblest. I went to Rhadamanthos and begged
and besought him to read the future for me and
map out my voyage, and he told me I should re-


<pb n="182"/>



turn to my native land after many wanderings
and dangers, but he persisted in refusing to set
the time of my arrival. However, he pointed out
the neighboring islands, of which five were visible, with a sixth in the distance, and told me
these were the islands of the wicked, these nearer
ones, “from which," said he, "you see the great
fires flaming up, and the sixth, yonder, is the
City of Dreams. Beyond this is Kalypso's
island, but you cannot see it from here. When
you have sailed past these you will come to the
great continent which is opposite your own.
There you will have many adventures and pass
among all sorts of tribes, and visit barbarous people, and in time you will come to the other continent."
So much he told me; and, plucking a mallowroot from the earth, he handed it to me, bidding
me call upon this in my greatest perils. He also
laid these injunctions on me in case I should ever
get back to this country: never to stir the fire
with my sword, never to eat beans, and never to
kiss a girl more than eighteen years old. If I
should keep these rules in mind I might confidently hope to return to the island.
After this I made ready for the voyage, and
when the time was come I feasted together with
them. The next morning I went to Homer, the
poet, to ask him to write me a distich for an in-

scription, and when he had composed it I erected
a pillar of beryll stone above the harbor, and inscribed it as follows:
“Lucian, beloved of the gods who dwell in bliss everlasting,
Saw these realms, and then returned to the land of his
fathers."
This was our last day; on the next we set forth,
escorted by the heroes. At this juncture Odysseus, too, came to me unbeknownst to Penelope,
and gave me a letter to carry to Kalypso in the
island of Ogygia.
[The first land made by Lucian on this voyage
was one of the Islands of the Wicked, where Timon of Athens was gate-keeper. Here he saw
Kinyras and others in torment, but the severest
punishments were reserved for liars and inaccurate historians, among whom he saw Ktesias the
Knidian and Herodotus. Thence he sailed to
the Island of Dreams, and so to Ogygia.]
On the third day thereafter we made the island
of Ogygia and went ashore, but first I opened the
letter and read the contents. It ran as follows:
ODYSSEUS GREETS KALYPSO.
Know that as soon as I sailed away from your
island on the raft I had built I suffered ship-

wreck, and was only just saved by Leukothea and
brought to the country of the Phaeacians. They
conveyed me to my own land, where I found my
wife's numerous suitors revelling at my expense.
I killed them all, but was afterwards taken off by
Telegonos, my son by Circe. At present I am in
the Island of the Blest, repenting deeply that I
left your hospitality and the immortality you offered me, and as soon as I get a chance I will
make my escape and come to you."
This was what the letter said, together with a
request that she would show us hospitality.
When I had advanced a short distance from
the sea I found a cave such as Homer described,
and the lady herself spinning wool. When she
had taken the letter and read it through she burst
into tears and wept a long time, but after a while
she invited us to dinner and feasted us nobly.
She asked questions about Odysseus and about
Penelope, what she was like to look at, and whether her good sense was so remarkable as Odysseus
used to boast it. We made such answers as we
thought would be agreeable to her. Then we
went off to the ship and bivouacked near by on
the beach.
These, then, were my adventures on the sea,
during my voyage among the islands, in the air,

afterwards in the whale and when we had escaped thence, and among the heroes . . . until
I reached the opposite continent. What happened
to me on land I will describe in the following

Mnesippos. What do you say, Toxaris? Do you Scythians sacrifice to
Orestes and Pylades, and believe in
them as gods?
Toxaris. We sacrifice to them,
certainly; still we do not hold them to be gods,
but good men.
Mnesippos. But is it customary with you to sacrifice to good men, too, when they die, just as you
do to the gods?
Toxaris. Not only that, but we keep feast-days
and holidays in their honor.
Mnesippos. What do you hope to get from them?
Surely you don't offer sacrifice for the sake of
getting the good-will of dead men.
Toxaris. It is no harm to have even the dead
on your side. But we also consider that we act
for the advantage of the living by keeping the
great and good in mind, and for this reason we
honor the dead. For it is our belief that by these
means many of our people will conceive a desire
to be such men as these were.
Mnesippos. You are right about that. But what
was it you found so admirable in Orestes and


<pb n="190"/>



Pylades that you raised them to equality with the
gods, though they were strangers in your land
and your bitter foes? For when the Scythians
of that day had seized them after their shipwreck
and driven them off to be sacrificed to Artemis,
they set upon the jailers, overpowered the guard,
slew the king, carried off the priestess, and actually stole the statue of Artemis herself and set
sail, laughing at the commonwealth of Scythia.
Now, if this is the sort of thing you honor the
men for, you cannot be too quick to produce many
like them. But consider yourselves what the result will be, to judge from the past—whether it is
to your advantage to have many cases of Orestes
and Pylades sailing into Scythian ports. To my
mind this would be the quickest way to become
irreverent and godless yourselves, and to banish
the surviving gods from your country. Then, I
suppose, you will transfer your devotions from
the whole body of gods to the men who come to
steal them, and sacrifice to your temple-robbers
as if they were divine. But if it is not for these
achievements that you honor Orestes and Pylades,
tell me, Toxaris, what else they ever did for your
good, in return for which you have now reversed
your former judgment and sacrifice to them,
bringing victims to those who once came extremely near being victims themselves. It seems
absurdly inconsistent with the past.


<pb n="191"/>

TOXARIS.

Toxaris. And yet, Mnesippos, those were noble
deeds, though you laugh at them. Just think,
they were only two men, and yet they dared this
gallant adventure; sailed all this distance from
home and ventured into the Pontos, unknown as
yet to the Greeks, except those who manned the
Argo in the expedition against Kolchis, and they
were not frightened by the stories about this sea
or its name of "The Inhospitable," gained for
it, I suppose, by the savage tribes on its shores.
And when they were captured they took the affair
in such a courageous way that they were not contented merely to make their escape, but when
they had first taken their revenge and carried off
the statue of Artemis, then they sailed away.
Now, are not these wonderful achievements, and
really worthy of divine honor from any one who
gives bravery his approval? Still, it is not because we see these traits in Orestes and Pylades
that we deem them heroes.
Mnesippos. Do go on and tell of something else
they did, really divine and godlike. As far as
their voyage and their journey into foreign lands
are concerned, I could show you a great many
more godlike among the merchants, particularly
the Phoenicians, who not only sailed into the
Pontos and as far as the Maiotis and the Bosporos, but to every point in Greek or barbarian wa-

every cape and every peninsula, so to speak, and
late in the autumn they sail back to their own
country. To be consistent, you hold these, too,
as gods-peddlers, and perhaps fish-mongers,
though most of them be.
Toxaris. Now listen, my amazing friend, and
observe how much more candidly we barbarians
judge good men than you Greeks. In Argos and
Mykenai there is not even a noble tomb to be
seen of Orestes and Pylades, but in our country
there is shown a temple raised to them in common, as was natural since they were comrades,
and sacrifices are offered to them and all other
honors. The fact that they were foreigners, not
Scythians, does not in the least prevent their
being adjudged good men. For we do not ask
whence noble and good people come, and we
bear them no grudge for working good deeds,
even if they are not our friends. On the contrary we applaud their acts, and adopt them as
countrymen on the strength of them. But what
we chiefly wondered at and praised in these men
was this, that they seemed to us to be the noblest
pair of friends in the world, and authorized to
lay down for the rest of mankind the principle
that friends must share all fortunes, and thus win
the reverence of the best of the Scythians.
Our ancestors inscribed an account of their
sufferings with each other, or for each other, on a


<pb n="193"/>

TOXARIS.
193
bronze pillar and set it up as an offering in the
Oresteion, making a law that the earliest training
and education of their children should be to learn
by heart the inscription on this pillar. The result is that it would be easier for one of them to
forget his father's name than to be in ignorance
of the deeds of Orestes and Pylades. Moreover,
on the wall enclosing the temple there are ancient
pictures displaying everything related on the pillar. One shows Orestes sailing in company with
his friend; another shows him captured after his
ship went to pieces on the rocks and made ready
for the sacrifice, with Iphigeneia in the act of beginning the ceremony. On the opposite wall he
is seen at the moment when he had burst his
bonds and was killing Thoas and a number of
other Scythians, and, finally, they are painted
sailing away with Iphigeneia and the goddess.
The Scythians are vainly trying to stop the ship,
which is already under sail, and are hanging in
the rigging and trying to board her; but they fail
completely and some get wounded, and others,
in fear of a like fate, swim off to land. In this
picture we can see best how much tenderness
they showed for each other in the struggle with
the Scythians. For the artist has depicted each
careless of his own opponents, but warding off
attacks on his friend, and trying to receive the
missiles intended for him, thinking it nothing to
13


<pb n="194"/>



die in saving his friend and taking on his own
body the blow aimed at the other.
Such devotion as this of theirs, such partnership in dangers, the faithfulness and good-fellowship and honesty and firmness of their mutual
love, seemed to us not to belong to human nature,
but to a finer temperament than that of men. For
the majority, as long as the wind is favorable,
take it ill if their friends do not divide their pleasures with them in equal shares, but if there comes
the least breath of adversity they leave them to
face danger alone. I will tell you another thing,
too, that there is no office of friendship that a
Scythian thinks greater, nor anything in which
he takes more pride, than helping a friend in trouble and sharing his dangers, so that we think the
hardest name a man can be called is "traitor to
friendship." This is the reason we honor Orestes
and Pylades, who were the best in what the Scythians deem good, and pre-eminent in friendship,
which we admire above all things. So we have
given them the name of “Korakoi,” which in our
language signifies "genii of friendship."
Mnesippos. Toxaris, I see that the Scythians
have not only been great archers, and better
than other nations in warlike pursuits, but are
also the most persuasive orators in the world.
For though I was of the other opinion a while
ago, I now think you are quite right to deify


<pb n="195"/>

TOXARIS.
195
Orestes and Pylades. And I had no idea, my
dear fellow, that you were a good painter as well.
You have brought before me most vividly the
pictures in the Oresteion, and the battle of the
heroes and their vicarious wounds; but I never
should have supposed that friendship was made
so much of among the Scythians. I thought that
inasmuch as they are inhospitable and wild, they
dwelt together in constant feud and passion and
anger, and entertained no friendship towards
even their next of kin, judging from the things
we hear of them, and particularly that they eat
their fathers when they are dead.
Toxaris. Whether we are juster and more
pious than the Greeks in these other matters,
such as our relations with our parents, is not a
point that I care to dispute with you at present;
but it is easy to show that Scythian friends are
far truer than Greek friends, and friendship is
made more of by us than by you. Now, by the
gods of the Greeks, do not take it ill if I tell you
some of the things I have noted in my long stay
among you. You seem to me to be able to discuss friendship, it is true, better than other people, but your practice of it is by no means worthy
of your preaching. In fact, you are perfectly satisfied when you have eulogized it and shown how
great a good it is, and in time of need you forsake your theories and make your escape some-


<pb n="196"/>



how from the thick of action. Whenever the tragedians mount the stage and show you instances
of the friendship you admire, you cry, "Bravo!"
and applaud; and when they run into danger for
another, most of you are even moved to tears;
but in your own persons you do not venture to
perform any praiseworthy act for another; and
if your friend happens to be in need of anything,
all these sentiments of tragedy instantly take to
themselves wings and fly away like dreams, leaving you like those empty, hollow masks whose
great yawning mouths utter not the slightest
sound. With us the case is reversed; for in
proportion as we are poorer in arguments about
friendship we are richer in its works.
Come, now, let us do something of this sort, if
it takes your fancy. Let us leave the friends of
old whom you or I could count out of the question; for under that head you would be rich in
them, summoning many credible poets to testify
to the friendship of Achilles and Patroklos, and
the camaraderie of Theseus and Peirithoos and
the others, singing them in metre with the most
beautiful language. But let us select a few from
our contemporaries and tell their exploits-I for
Scythia, you for Greece-and he who is victorious and able to produce the best friends will be
openly the better man, and will proclaim his the
better country, because he has won in a very no-


<pb n="197"/>

TOXARIS.
197
ble and beautiful contest. For my part, I should
vastly prefer losing my right hand for having
been worsted in single combat-that is the Scythian forfeit to being judged inferior to another
man in respect of friendship, and that, too, though
I am a Greek Scythian myself.
Mnesippos. It is no joke, Toxaris, to venture
single combat with a man like you for opponent,
equipped with arguments so pointed and so apt.
However, I will not basely leave the whole Greek
cause in the lurch on such short notice and retire
before you; for, seeing that so many Scythians,
as your stories and ancient paintings show, of
which you delivered such a vigorous account a
little while ago, were worsted by two, it would be
a great scandal if all the Greeks, so many nations
and so many cities as they are, should lose their
case by default to you. If this should happen, it
would be fair to cut off, not my right hand, as
your custom is, but my tongue. But shall we
limit ourselves as to the number of friendly exploits, or shall he who is able to mention most
have so much better chance of victory?
Toxaris. Oh dear, no. Let us agree that victory shall not lie in the number of exploits; but
if yours are better and more striking than mine,
though the same in number, they will, of course,
wound me more vitally, and I shall give way
sooner before their blows.


<pb n="198"/>



Mnesippos. Very well. Let us agree how many
are enough. Five apiece, it strikes me.
Toxaris. I think so, too. But first declare, and
upon oath, that you will speak the very truth.
Otherwise, to invent this kind of thing is no great
job, and refutation would be difficult; but if you
should take your oath it would be impious not to
believe you.
Mnesippos. We will swear, if you do not think
an oath superfluous. But which of our gods do
you
Or will the God of Friendship do?
Toxaris. Certainly; but I will take our national oath when it is my turn to speak.
Mnesippos. Then let Zeus, the God of Friendship, witness that all I shall tell you I speak
either of my own knowledge or having learned
from others, with all the exactitude in my power,
and adding nothing of my own to the story.
[His first story celebrates the friendship of
Agathokles of Samos for Deinias of Ephesos.
Deinias was a very rich young man, who was
surrounded by evil companions, and soon wasted
his whole substance in riotous living. Thereupon Agathokles, a man of moderate means and
his friend from childhood, whose good advice
had made him insupportable in the heyday of
Deinias's prosperity, sold the house of his fathers
and handed over the proceeds to his friend. Deinias finally killed two persons in a disgraceful

embroglio, and was sentenced to transportation
for life to one of the Cyclades. Agathokles accompanied him into exile, tended him through a
long illness, and after his death continued to
live in the island to be near the grave of his
friend.]
Toxaris. I wish you were not on oath, Mnesippos, so that I might be at liberty to disbelieve
your story. By your account this Agathokles is
a true Scythian in friendship. I hope you are
not going to tell of any one else like him.
Mnesippos. Then hear about another, Euthydikos of Chalkis. Simylos, the ship-master of
Megara, told me the story, swearing that he had
seen the thing with his own eyes. He said he
was sailing from Italy to Athens early in the autumn, carrying passengers from various places,
and among these were Euthydikos and Damon
his friend, a Chalkidian like himself. They were
of the same age, but Euthydikos was strong and
robust, while Damon was pale and feeble and
seemed to be just recovering from a long illness.
Now, as far as Sicily, Simylos said, the voyage was
prosperous, but when they had passed through
the strait and come out into the Ionian Sea a
great storm fell upon them. It would be useless
to give the details-whelming waves and waterspouts and hail-storms and all the horrors of a
gale. But when they were just off Zakynthos,


<pb n="200"/>



scudding under bare poles, with cordage dangling
overboard to break the force of the sea, Damon
grew sea-sick in such a pitching and tossing, and
leaned over the side of the ship to vomit. Just
then, I suppose, the ship heeled over more violently to that side and the wave receded at the
same time. At all events, he fell head foremost
into the sea with all his clothes on, poor
wretch! which made swimming all the harder.
He straightway gave a choking shriek, hardly
keeping himself on top of the wave. When Euthydikos, who happened to have his clothes off
in bed, heard it, he threw himself into the sea,
got hold of Damon, who had already given upall this could be seen from a distance in the
bright moonlight—and swam along with him,
helping to keep him above water. Those on the
ship were eager to help them and full of pity for
their fate, but they could no nothing, running before such a gale. One thing only was possible,
and that they did; they threw overboard for
them a great number of corks and some puntingpoles, so that they might swim on one of these if
they chanced on it; and finally they threw over
the companion - ladder bodily, which was a large
one.
Consider, now, in Heaven's name, what stronger proof of affection a man could give to his
friend who had fallen by night into such a wild


<pb n="201"/>

TOXARIS.
201
sea than to share his death! Pray, call before
your eyes the towering waves, the noise of the
broken water, the boiling foam, the night, the
despair; then that drowning man, hardly keeping his head above water, stretching out his hands
to his comrade, and the comrade leaping to him
instantly and swimming with him, fearful lest Damon should perish before him.
This is the way
to see that in Euthydikos, too, I have described
for you no unworthy friend.
Toxaris. Were they lost, Mnesippos, or were
they saved by some miracle? I am greatly
alarmed about them.
Mnesippos. Be comforted. They were saved,
and they are in Athens at this moment, pursuing
philosophy. Simylos could only tell me what he
saw that night, that the one fell overboard and
the other leaped after him, and that they were
swimming together as far as they could be seen
in the night. But the sequel I learned from Euthydikos's friends. In the first place, they came
upon some of the corks and supported themselves
on these, swimming with difficulty; and later,
towards daybreak, they saw the companion and
swam to it, and, mounted on this, they swam easily the rest of the way to Zakynthos.
After these, who are not bad specimens in my
opinion, hear of a third man no whit worse than
they. Eudamidas of Corinth, himself a very poor


<pb n="202"/>



man, had two rich friends, Aretaios of Corinth
and Charixenes of Sikyon. When he died he left
a will, which perhaps may seem absurd to others,
but I am not at all sure that such things do to
you, a man of virtue, who honor friendship, and
are competing for the first prize in it. The will
read: "I bequeath to Aretaios my mother to support and tend in her old age, and to Charixenes
my daughter to give in marriage, with as large a
dowry as he can afford,”—for he had an aged mother and a young daughter just of marriageable age
-"and if, in the mean time, anything happens to
either of the legatees, let the other," said the will,
"take his share." When this will was read, those
who knew the poverty of Eudamidas but were not
aware of the friendship between him and the legatees, turned the matter to a jest, and every one
of them went off laughing and saying that Aretaios
and Charixenes had come into a joyful inheritance if they were to make payment to Eudamidas,
and if they who were living were to leave their
property to a dead man. But the heirs to whom
these things were bequeathed came as soon as
they heard of it, and carried out the provisions of
the will. Now, Charixenes died only five days.
later, and Aretaios showed himself the best of
heirs by assuming both his own share and the
other's. He still supports Eudamidas's mother,
and the daughter he gave in marriage not long

ago. Of his estate of five thousand dollars he
gave two thousand with his own daughter and
two thousand with the daughter of his friend, and
deemed it right to celebrate both marriages on
the same day. What do you think of Aretaios,
Toxaris? Does he seem to you to furnish a bad
example of friendship, inheriting such a legacy
and not betraying his friend's bequest? Or shall
our mature decision be to place him as one
among the five ?
Toxaris. He, too, is a noble man. But I admire far more the confidence which Eudamidas
placed in his friends. He showed that he, too,
would have done likewise for them, even if the
duty had not been left him by will, and would
have been the first to come as the unappointed
heir of such a legacy.
Mnesippos. You are right. But I will tell you
of a fourth, Zenothemis, the son of Charmoleos,
from Marseilles. He was pointed out to me in
Italy when I was there on an embassy from our
government, and he was a tall, handsome man,
and apparently rich. There sat beside him in
his carriage a woman who was hideous in every
way. Her right side, moreover, was withered,
and she had lost an eye. She was altogether deformed, a revolting scarecrow. On my expressing wonder that a man so handsome and in the
prime of life could endure to have such a woman


<pb n="204"/>



ure.
driving about with him, the man who had pointed
him out told me what had necessitated the marriage, for he knew all the circumstances perfectly,
being himself a native of Marseilles. He said
that Menekrates, the father of the ill-favored woman, and Zenothemis were friends, and equals in
riches and position. But after a while Menekrates was deprived of his estate, and at the same
time disfranchised by a condemnation of the Six
Hundred for proposing an unconstitutional meas-
This, he said, was the penalty in Marseilles
for making unconstitutional propositions. Now
Menekrates was in great grief, partly because of
the scandal of the condemnation, and partly because from being a rich and honored man he was
now become poor, and of no reputation. But his
greatest trouble was his daughter, who was already
marriageable, being eighteen years old, but of so
ill-favored an aspect that no one, however humbly
born or poor, would have seen fit to take her
without a struggle, even with all the fortune her
father once possessed. She was also said to have
epileptic fits at the waxing of the moon.
But Zenothemis, to whom he was pouring out
these griefs, said to him, “Cheer up, Menekrates.
You are not utterly destitute, nor will your daughter fail to find a bridegroom worthy of her race."
So saying, he took him by the hand, led him to
his house, and presented him with a share of his


<pb n="205"/>

TOXARIS.
205
great estate. Then he gave orders for a banquet,
and feasted his friends and Menekrates just as if
he had persuaded one of his companions to agree
to marry the girl. When the banquet was over,
and they had poured libations to the gods, he offered a brimming goblet to Menekrates and said:
"Receive a loving-cup from your son-in-law,
for this day I shall marry your daughter, Kydimache. Her dowry I took a long time ago,
twenty-five thousand dollars."
"Out with you!" cried Menekrates. “I hope
neither you nor I is so mad as to forget your
youth and beauty, and see you yoked with this
unsightly, disfigured girl."
But while he was still speaking the other carried
off the bride and presently came back, having
married her. And from that day he has held to
her with great affection, and takes her everywhere
with him, as you see. Far from being ashamed
of his marriage, he seems to take pride in it,
showing that he despises bodily charms or blemishes and wealth and public opinion, but regards
only his friend Menekrates, who, he thinks, is
none the worse in respect of friendship because
of the condemnation of the Six Hundred. However, Fortune herself has rewarded his deeds in
this way this ugly woman bore him a most
beautiful child, and the other day his father took
him up and carried him into the senate, garlanded


<pb n="206"/>



with the suppliant's twigs and wrapped in black
garments to make him the more pathetic, to plead
for his grandfather. And when the baby laughed
aloud at the senators and clapped his hands, they
warmed to the child and reversed the decision
against Menekrates; and at present he is enfranchised again, thanks to the advocate he employed with the senate.
This, then, is what the man from Marseilles
said Zenothemis had done for his friend, a noble
action, as you see, and such as few Scythians
would do, who are said to be particular in choosing the most beautiful women even for their harems.
We have the fifth case still to consider, and I
should not like to name another man and pass
over Demetrios of Sounion. This Demetrios
sailed to Egypt in company with Antiphilos of
Alopeke. They were friends from childhood,
being of the same age, and they lived together as
students in Egypt, Demetrios pursuing the Cynic
system under that famous sophist from Rhodes,
and Antiphilos studying medicine. It came to
pass after a while that Demetrios went into the
interior to see the Pyramids and the Memnon,
for he had heard of the Pyramids that, in spite of
their height, they throw no shadow, and of the
Memnon that it cries out at the rising of the sun.
Being desirous, then, of seeing the Pyramids and


<pb n="207"/>

TOXARIS.
207
hearing the Memnon, he sailed up the Nile, leaving Antiphilos, who dreaded the journey and the
heat, behind.
When Demetrios had been gone six months,
Antiphilos got into a scrape that called for some
very good friend. A slave of his, Syros by name
and a Syrian by nation, joined himself to a gang
of temple-robbers, and, entering the temple of
Anoubis in their company, stole from the god
two golden goblets, a caduceus-this also of gold
some dog-headed gods in silver, and other
booty of the sort, which was all stored with Syros.
They were caught selling some article and imprisoned, and when they were stretched on the wheel
they straightway confessed the whole. Being led
forth, they came to Antiphilos's house and brought
out the booty, which was lodged under a bed in
a dark corner. Both Syros and his master were
immediately bound, Antiphilos being seized in
the middle of his professor's lecture. Nobody
rescued him, but even those who had been his
companions turned away from the man who was
said to have robbed Anoubis, and they counted
it an impiety in themselves if they had ever drunk
or feasted with him. His other slaves, two in
number, cleared everything out of the house, and
ran off.
-
The unhappy Antiphilos had accordingly been
in durance a long time, with the reputation of


<pb n="208"/>



being the most abandoned malefactor in the prison, and the Egyptian jailer, a superstitious man,
considered that he was pleasing and avenging
the god by bearing heavily on Antiphilos. If
he ever defended himself, declaring that he had
never done anything of the sort, he was thought
utterly shameless, and hated the more. Presently
he fell ill and suffered a great deal, naturally, for
he slept on the ground, and at night he could
not stretch out his legs because they were in the
stocks. For by day the collar and a handcuff on
the left-hand were enough, but at night they must
needs bind him completely. Moreover, the illstench of the place, the stifling atmosphere created by so many prisoners confined in the same
room, cramped for space and hardly breathing,
the clang of iron, the scarcity of sleep-all these
things were oppressive and unendurable to a man
who was unused to them, and had had no experience of such a squalid life.
When he had begun to despair, and would not
even take food, Demetrios arrived one day, ignorant of all these events. When he learned how
things stood he came running forthwith to the
prison, but he was not admitted then, for it was
evening, and the jailer had locked the door some
time before and gone to sleep, bidding his slaves
to keep guard. But early in the morning he got
in, after many supplications, and, passing along,


<pb n="209"/>

TOXARIS.
209
sought Antiphilos for a long time, whose sufferings had made him unrecognizable. Making the
round he examined each of the prisoners, as people do who are searching in the ranks for their
own dead, already disfigured by death. And if
he had not called his name, "Antiphilos Deinomenous!" it would have been some time before
he recognized him, so greatly was he changed by
the horrors he had experienced. But when Antiphilos heard the voice he called in reply, and,
as the other approached, he parted his hair, filthy
and matted with dirt, and drew it back from his
face and showed who he was. Both the friends
fell swooning at the unexpected sight, but presently Demetrios raised himself and Antiphilos
too, and inquired of him exactly how everything
stood. He bade him be of good courage, and,
tearing his cloak in two, he wrapped himself in
one half and the other he gave to Antiphilos,
stripping off the dirty, ragged clouts he wore.
After this he kept him company, caring for
him and serving him in every way. He hired
himself to the merchants at the docks from daybreak till noon, and earned a good wage as a
stevedore. Then, leaving his work, he handed
over part of his earnings to the jailer, whom
he thus rendered gentle and peaceable, and the
rest sufficed him for his friend's maintenance.
Through the day he used to stay with Antiphilos,
14


<pb n="210"/>



cheering him up; but when night fell he would
rest close by the door on a little bed he had
made, with leaves thrown on it.
Some time, then, they passed in this way, Demetrios being free of entry and Antiphilos finding his misfortunes easier to bear. But after a
certain robber died in the prison, apparently of
poison, a strict guard was instituted, and no permissions whatever were granted to those who
asked to visit the prison. In these circumstances
Demetrios was in despair and grief, and, having
no other means of being near his friend, he went
to the governor and denounced himself as having a share in the undertaking against Anoubis.
At this statement he was forthwith taken off to
prison and brought to Antiphilos, for by many
prayers to the jailer he contrived by his authority to be fastened next to his friend in the same
stocks. It was then he showed most plainly the
tenderness he had for him by disregarding his
own sufferings. And yet he fell ill himself, but
he suffered the less because his mind was bent
on securing rest for his friend. So they bore
their troubles lightly, being together.
After a while an event happened, as follows,
which put an end to their misfortunes. One of
the prisoners provided himself with a file from
some source or other, and, with many of the captives for accomplices, sawed off the chain to which

they were fastened in a row, their wooden collars
being hung on it, and set them all free. They
had no difficulty in killing the guards, who were
few in number, and then scattered in all directions as each best could, most of them being taken
again afterwards. But Demetrios and Antiphilos
stayed on the spot, and even held Syros, who was
in the act of running off. When day broke and
the governor of Egypt heard what had happened,
he despatched men to pursue the runaways; but
sending for Demetrios and his friend he freed
them from their fetters, and praised them for having been the only ones who did not make off.
However, they were not the men to be satisfied
with this dismissal. On the contrary, Demetrios
cried aloud with indignation that it would be a
great injustice if they were to appear to be criminals who had been liberated out of pity or by
way of commendation for not having run away,
and finally he compelled the magistrate to make
a careful examination of the matter. When he
had informed himself of their innocence he dismissed them with eulogies, expressing great admiration for Demetrios in particular, and condoling with them on the punishment which they
had unjustly borne. He made them each a present out of his own pocket, two thousand dollars
to Antiphilos and twice as much to Demetrios.
Antiphilos is still living in Egypt, but Demetrios


<pb n="212"/>



left his four thousand dollars also with him and
went off into Egypt among the Bramins, saying
only this to Antiphilos, that his conduct in leaving him so soon would surely be excusable; he
had no need of the money as long as he kept his
present character of being able to do with little,
and Antiphilos had no need of a friend now that
his affairs were going smoothly. Such are Grecian friends, Toxaris, and if you had not already
slandered us by saying that we pride ourselves
on our phrases, I should have related to you the
many noble arguments that Demetrios used in
court, not defending himself at all, but Antiphilos,
actually with tears and supplications, until Syros
was flogged into acquitting them both.
My story, then, is told of this handful of good
and true friends out of the many that memory first
supplied me with, so I will now descend from
the post of orator and leave the floor to you.
But
you had better be careful to make your Scythians out no worse than these, but a good deal better, unless you want to lose your right hand. You
must speak up like a man, for it would be an
absurd experience for you if, after having praised
Orestes and Pylades like a professional orator,
you should prove an indifferent speaker in behalf
of the Scythians.
Toxaris. It is all very well that you spur me
on to speak! Don't you care whether you lose


<pb n="213"/>

TOXARIS.
213
your tongue by defeat in the contest? But I will
begin directly without any of your phrase-making; that is not our way in Scythia, particularly
when the deeds speak louder than the words
that tell of them. You need not expect me to
follow you in elaborating the praises of a hero
who married a plain wife without a dowry, or another who gave two thousand dollars as a wedding-present to a friend's daughter, or even one
who offered himself for imprisonment with the
certainty of a speedy release. For all these are
trifles, and not one of them calls for exertion or
courage. But I will tell you of many a murder
and war and death for the sake of a friend, to
show that it is childish to compare your case with
ours in Scythia. Still, your feeling is reasonable
enough, and it is natural that you should eulogize
these small matters, for you have no great occasions for displaying friendship, sunk in peace as
you are, just as calm weather furnishes no opportunity to learn a pilot's quality. You need a
storm for that. But with us one war follows on
the heels of another, and we are either riding
against some one else, or retiring before invaders,
or falling to and fighting about pasturage or booty.
In these emergencies, above all others, a man
needs stanch friends. Accordingly, we cement
friendships in the most enduring way, deeming
them our only invincible weapons.


<pb n="214"/>



In the first place, I should like to describe to
you our manner of acquiring friends. We do not
do it over our cups as you do, or because a certain man happens to be a playfellow or a neighbor; but when we see a good man of great ability, we all strive for him, and we think it proper
to win a friend as you do a wife, courting him a
long time and taking all similar measures not to
meet with a disappointment in friendship or figure
as rejected aspirants. And when at length one
has been chosen as his friend, the next step is a
contract and a mighty oath that they will live
together and, if need be, die for one another.
This is the manner of the oath: we cut our fingers and let the blood trickle into a cup and then
we dip our sword-points in it and, desisting from
this at the same moment, we drink. When once
we have done this, nothing can thereafter put us
asunder. Three at most are permitted to enter
into such a contract, since a man with many
friends seems as bad to us as a woman with many
lovers or husbands, and we think his friendship
will no longer be so sure when it is parcelled
among many tendernesses.
I will begin with the recent adventures of Dandamis. When his friend Amizokes was carried
off as a prisoner of war by the Sauromatians—
but first I will take our national oath for you,
since that was our original agreement.
I swear


<pb n="215"/>

TOXARIS.
215
by the Wind and by the Sword, Mnesippos, that
I will tell you nothing false about Scythian
friends.
Mnesippos. I did not insist on an oath from
you, Toxaris; but you did well not to swear by
any god.
Toxaris. What do you mean? Don't you think
that the Wind and the Sword are gods? Are you,
perhaps, unaware that nothing is greater to men
than life and death? So whenever we swear by
the Wind and the Sword we swear by the Wind
as the source of life and the Sword because it
brings death.
Mnesippos. If that is your reason you might
have plenty of other gods like the Sword: the
arrow and the spear and the hemlock and the
noose, and the like.
For this god Death has
many forms, and offers innumerable roads lead
ing his way.
Toxaris. See now how captious you are! What
a lawyer's trick it is to break in in the midst and
spoil my speech! I held my tongue while you
were talking.
Mnesippos. I'll not do it again, Toxaris, your
reproof was very just. So go on with confidence
just as if I were not present to hear you. I will
be as silent as that.
Toxaris. It was the fourth day of friendship
between Dandamis and Amizokes, that is, since


<pb n="216"/>



they had drunk each other's blood, when the
Sauromatians invaded our country with ten thousand horsemen and an army of foot reported to
be three times as many.
Since they fell upon us
when we were not expecting an invasion, they put
all our troops to flight, killing many of the warriors and capturing the survivors, except a few
who were quick enough to swim across the river
to where the other half of our camp was with part
of the wagons. For our leaders had seen fit for
some reason or other to encamp us in that way
on both banks of the Tanais. They next proceeded to drive off our flocks, secure the prisoners, pillage the tents and seize the wagons, most
of which they captured, men and all, and they insulted our wives and concubines under our very
eyes, which nearly maddened us.
Now Amizokes was taken prisoner, and as they
were leading him off he called upon his friend by
name, cruelly bound as he was, and reminded him
of the cup
of blood. When Dandamis heard him
he did not hesitate an instant, but swam across to
the enemy with all of us looking on. The Sauromatians, lifting their darts, set on him as if to kill
him, but he shouted the word "Ziris!" When a
man says this word the enemy do not kill him,
but receive him as a messenger about exchange
of prisoners. So he was led to the commander,
and of him he demanded his friend. The com-


<pb n="217"/>

TOXARIS.
217
mander asked for a ransom, saying the prisoner
should not go forth unless he got a great price
for him.
"All that I possessed," said Dandamis, "has
been pillaged by you. But if, stripped as I am,
I can in any way pay the price, I am at your service. Command what you will. If you like, take
me in his stead, and use me as you see fit."
"There is no need," said the Sauromatian, "to
keep the whole of you, particularly as you came
saying 'Ziris!' but lay down a part of what you
have, and you may take your friend."
Dandamis asked what he wanted, and the other demanded his eyes. He instantly presented
them to be cut out, and when this had been done,
and the Sauromatians were in possession of the
ransom, he received Amizokes and went away
leaning on him, and together they swam across
and returned to us saved. This event put heart
into all the Scythians, and they no longer considered themselves worsted by the Sauromatians,
seeing that the enemy had not carried off our
greatest good, but that our noble disposition was
left to us and our constancy in friendship. And
the same thing frightened the Sauromatians extremely, for they calculated what sort of men we
would be to fight with when we were prepared if
we showed such endurance when we were surprised. So when night came they left most of the


<pb n="218"/>



flocks, and burned the wagons and retreated. But
Amizokes could no longer bear to see at the price
of Dandamis's blindness, so he, too, put out his
own eyes, and they were both permitted a quiet
life by the Scythian commonwealth, and supported
at the public expense with every honor.
What could you tell to match this, Mnesippos,
if I should let you count up ten more in addition
to your five, and not on oath, either, so that you
might add plenty of inventions? And yet I gave
you the bare facts. If you had told a story like
this I know very well how much cleverness you
would have mixed in your tale, what prayers Dandamis offered, and the manner of blinding him,
and what he said and how he went off again, and
how the Scythians received him with blessings,
and the other devices you are wont to employ on
your audience.
But now hear of another man, equally admirable: Belittas, a cousin of this Amizokes. When
he saw his friend Basthes dragged from his horse
by a lion-they happened to be hunting together
—and that the lion had already clutched him and
clung to his throat tearing him with his claws, he
leaped down from his own horse, fell upon the
beast from behind, and dragged him over, diverting his rage to himself. He passed his fingers
between the animal's teeth, and tried his best to
drag Basthes out of his jaws until the lion let


<pb n="219"/>

TOXARIS.
219
him go, half dead already, and, turning upon Belittas, grappled with him and slew him too. But
even as he was dying he found time to strike the
lion in the breast with his sword, so that they all
died together, and we buried them, digging two
graves near together, one for the friends and one
opposite for the lion.
My third case, Mnesippos, shall be the friendship of Makentes, Lonchates, and Arsakomas.
This Arsakomas fell in love with Mazaia, daughter of Leukanor, king of the Bosporians, when he
went as an envoy in the matter of the tribute
which the Bosporians pay us periodically, and
which was then three months overdue. Mazaia
was a tall, beautiful girl, and Arsakomas, seeing
her at dinner, became enamored and fell into a
bad way about her. He had finished the business
of the tribute, and the king had given him his
answer, and was feasting him by way of dismissal. Now it is the custom on the Bosporos for
suitors to propose for girls at dinner, stating the
qualifications which render them desirable parties. On this occasion there happened to be a
great many aspirants at the dinner, kings and
kings' sons, and Tigrapates was there, the monarch of the Lazians, and Adyrmachos, the ruler
of Machlyëne, with many others. Each suitor
is obliged to announce himself and tell why he
has come a-wooing, and then to eat his dinner


<pb n="220"/>



quietly, sitting among the others. But when dinner is over he must ask for a wine-glass and pour
out a libation on the table, and propose for the
girl, setting forth his advantages of birth, or
wealth, or influence, in the most favorable light.
In accordance with this custom many had poured
out the libation and made their proposals, counting up their kingdoms and riches; and last of all
Arsakomas called for a glass, and instead of pouring out a libation-for it is not our practice to
pour out our wine, indeed it is held an impiety
towards the god - he emptied the glass at a
draught, and said:
"Your majesty, give me your daughter Mazaia
to hold as my wife. I am a better match than
these others as far as wealth and possessions go."
Leukanor was amazed, for he knew that Arsakomas was poor, and a commoner of the Scythians, and he inquired:
"How much cattle have you, Arsakomas, or
how many wagons? For these are the things you
Scythians are rich in.”
"Nay," said Arsakomas, “I have neither wagons nor herds, but I have two friends so noble
and brave that no other Scythian can match
them."
A shout of laughter rose at these words, and
no account was taken of his offer, for they thought
he was drunk. In the early morning Adyrmachos,


<pb n="221"/>

TOXARIS.
221
who had been chosen from the other suitors, made
ready to conduct his bride to the Maiotis among
the Machlyëans. But Arsakomas made his way
home and told his friends how he had been insulted by the king, and laughed to scorn at the
dinner because they thought him poor.
"And yet," said he, "I explained to the king
how rich I am in having you, Lonchates and Makentes, and how much better and more secure
your devotion is than the power of the Bosporians.
But while I was going through this he flouted
me and passed me by, and bestowed the right to
lead away the bride on Adyrmachos the Machlyean, because he said he owned ten golden goblets
and eighty four-seated wagons, and any amount
of sheep and cattle. You see how high above
true men he rates store of beeves and superfluous
drinking-cups and heavy wagons. For my part,
my friends, I was doubly wounded, both because
I love Mazaia, and because this public affront cut
me deeply, and I think you were as much wronged
as I.
For a third of the insult belongs to each
of you, at least if we were living as though we
were one man since the day we came together,
and feel pain and pleasure from the same
causes."
"Not only so," rejoined Lonchates, "but each
of us feels the whole of the insult when you are
treated in that way."


<pb n="222"/>



“The next question,” said Makentes, “is, what
Ishall we do in this case?"
"Let us parcel out the job," said Lonchates.
"I, for my part, promise to bring to Arsakomas
the head of Leukanor, and you must fetch him
the bride."
"Very good," said he. "And you, Arsakomas,
seeing that this is a great business, must stay here
to collect and make ready arms and horses and
other equipment as much as you can get. For it
is not unlikely that an army and a war will be
what we shall need next. You will have no trouble in gathering a goodly following since you are
a true man yourself, and our kinsmen are not
few; but the best way will be to take your seat
on the ox-hide."
These plans were agreed to, and Lonchates
went off, just as he was, direct to the Bosporos,
and Makentes to the Machlyëans, both on horseback. Arsakomas stayed at home and addressed
himself to the young men, armed a force of his
kinsmen, and finally seated himself on the oxhide.
The custom of the hide is this: When a man
has received an injury and wishes to revenge
himself on some one, but sees that his unaided
strength will not suffice him, he sacrifices an ox,
cuts the flesh in pieces and boils it, stretches the
hide on the ground and seats himself on it, draw-


<pb n="223"/>

TOXARIS.
223
ing his hands behind his back as if his arms were
tied at the elbow. This is our most urgent form
of supplication. The flesh of the ox lies alongside, and kinsmen, and any one else who will, take
a morsel, and, setting the right foot on the hide,
promise aid according to the ability of each, one
agreeing to furnish five horsemen, found and paid,
another ten, another yet more, another hoplites or
foot-soldiers as many as he is able, and the poorest offering himself alone. Sometimes a great
throng gathers about the hide, and a force of this
sort is most sure to hang together and most irresistible in battle because they are upon oath, for
stepping upon the hide constitutes an oath.
In this way Arsakomas occupied himself, and
about five thousand horsemen joined him, and
hoplites and foot-soldiers to the number of twen.
ty thousand.
Lonchates made his way to the Bosporos incognito, and presented himself before the king,
who was engaged in affairs of state, saying that
he came as a public emissary from Scythia, but
brought also private news of great moment to the
king. When he was bidden speak, he said:
"The Scythians make this public and open demand: that your herdsmen will not cross over
into our plains, but pasture their flocks only to
the end of the rocky ground. And they deny that
the plunderers of whose incursions into your


<pb n="224"/>



country you complain were sent out with the
general consent, but declare that each of them
carries on his robbery for his own private advantage; and that if one of them should be caught
you are authorized to punish him. This is their
communication. But I will inform you on my
own account of a great expedition that is coming
against you under Arsakomas, son of Mariantes,
who was recently an envoy to your court. I believe your rejection of him as a suitor for your
daughter is the cause of his enmity. He has been
sitting on the ox-hide this week past and has collected a considerable force."
"I had heard myself," rejoined Leukanor,
"that a force was being gathered by some one's
ox-hide, but I did not know that it was collected
against us, or that Arsakomas was at the head of it."
66
"It is against you, however, that it is being
prepared," said Lonchates. But Arsakomas is
an enemy of mine, and he takes it ill that I am
honored before him by the elders and am thought
the better man in all respects. And if you should
promise me your other daughter, Barketis-since
I am no unworthy match in other respects-I will
come before long and bring you his head.
"I promise," said the king, growing extremely
frightened, for he knew the reason Arsakomas
had for being angry about the marriage, and he
always trembled at the Scythians anyhow.


<pb n="225"/>

TOXARIS.
225
"Swear, then," said Lonchates, "in very truth
to keep your agreement and not to repudiate it."
At this point, and just as the king had lifted
his hand to heaven, intending to swear, Lonchates said,
"Not here, for some of the by-standers might
suspect the matter of our oath. But let us go
into the temple of Ares here and shut the doors
and take our oaths so that nobody can hear them.
For if Arsakomas should get wind of this I am
afraid he would offer me up ås a sacrifice before
battle, since he is already surrounded by no small
force."
"Very well," said the king. Then, turning to
his attendants," Remove to a distance, and let
no one be found in the temple unless I call him."
When they had entered and the body-guard
had withdrawn, Lonchates drew his sword, grasped the king's mouth with his other hand to prevent his crying out, and smote him in the breast.
Then he cut off his head and went out with it
under his cloak, pretending to speak with the
king as he went, and saying that he would be
back directly, as if Leukanor had sent him on
some errand.
When he had thus made his way to the place
where he had left his horse tied, he mounted and
spurred off to Scythia. There was no pursuit,
for it was a long time before the Bosporians
15


<pb n="226"/>



found out what had happened, and when they
did find it out they fell to quarrelling about the
succession. These, then, were the exploits of
Lonchates, done in fulfilling his promise to Arsakomas by bringing the head of Leukanor.
Makentes, on his part, arrived among the Machlyëans, having heard on the road what had
happened at the Bosporus. Thus he was the
first to announce to them the murder of the king,
and he added:
"The state, Adyrmachos, summons you to the
throne because you are his son-in-law. So do
you ride first and seize the empire, appearing on
the scene while matters are in disorder. Let the
young lady follow after you with chariots, for you
will the more easily conciliate the Bosporian mob
if they see the daughter of Leukanor. I am an
Alanian and related to the girl on the mother's
side, for it was from our family that Leukanor
chose his wife, Masteira. And now I am come
to you from Masteira's brothers in Alania, who
bid you ride to the Bosporos as quickly as you
may, and not permit the empire to pass into the
hands of Eubiotos, a bastard brother of Leukanor, who has always been a friend of the Scythians and detested by the Alanians."
This speech Makentes delivered, wearing the
dress of the Alanians and speaking their language, for on these points the Scythians and


<pb n="227"/>

TOXARIS.
227
Alanians agree with this one exception, that the
Alanians do not wear their hair very long, as the
Scythians do. But in this respect, too, Makentes
had likened himself to an Alanian by cutting his
hair as much short of the Scythian length as an
Alanian's would probably be. So by these means
he got credence as a relative of Masteira and
Mazaia.
"And now, Adyrmachos," said he, "I am ready
to ride with you to the Bosporos if you like, or,
if need be, to stay behind and escort the young
lady."
"That is what I should prefer," said Adyrmachos, "to have you escort Mazaia. For if
you go with us to the Bosporos we should only
be one horseman the more, but if you should
escort my wife for me you would be worth a multitude."
This was done, and Adyrmachos rode off, having handed over his maid-wife Mazaia to Makentes. He, on his part, escorted her in her
chariot during the day, but when night fell he
set her upon a horse-for he had provided that
one horseman beside himself should accompany
them-and, leaping on his own, he no longer rode
by the Maiotis, but turned off inland, keeping
the Mitraian mountains on his right. He let the
the girl rest now and then, and on the third day
crossed the Machlyëan border into Scythia. His


<pb n="228"/>



horse, when he stopped galloping, stood still for
a moment, and then fell dead.
Makentes handed over Mazaia to Arsakomas,
saying, "Receive the fulfilment of my promise
also." He was stunned by the unexpected vision,
and strove to express his thanks, but Makentes
said, "Stop trying to make me out a different
person from yourself. To thank me for what I
have done is much as if my left-hand should acknowledge its obligation to my right because it
had been tended when it was wounded, and tenderly cared for when it was tired. So it would
be an absurdity in us, too, if we who have joined
our fortunes this long time, and as nearly as possible made ourselves into one man, should still
think it a great thing if a part of us does something for the good of the whole body. For it is
for his own good that he does it, seeing he is part
of the benefitted whole." Thus did Makentes
meet Arsakomas's thanks.
Adyrmachos, when he heard of the fraud, did
not continue his journey to the Bosporos, for
Eubiotos was already installed in office, having
been summoned from Sauromatia, where he was
sojourning. He returned home, collected a great
army, and marched through the hill-country upon
Scythia. Soon after, Eubiotos, too, made an attack, leading a rabble of Greeks and picked
troops from Alania and Sauromatia, forty thou-


<pb n="229"/>

TOXARIS.
229
sand strong. He and Adyrmachos joined forces,
thus forming an army of ninety thousand men, of
whom a third were mounted archers. But wefor I, too, had a share in their rising, and contributed a hundred found horsemen on the occasion
of the ox-hide-assembled to the number of nearly thirty thousand, counting the horsemen, and
awaited the onset. Arsakomas was in command.
When we saw them coming we advanced to
meet them, sending the cavalry against them first.
When the battle had been fiercely waged a long
time our side began to give in. Our phalanx was
gradually broken into, and finally the whole Scythian army was cut in two, and one part retired,
not distinctly worsted, however; indeed, their
flight looked like an orderly retreat, and even the
Alanians did not dare to pursue them far. But
the Machlyeans and Alanians surrounded the other half, which was the smaller, and cut them down
in every direction with a generous discharge of
arrows and darts, so that the surrounded were
almost exhausted, and most of them were already
throwing down their arms. As it happened, both
Lonchates and Makentes were in this division,
and they had both been wounded already through
their hardihood-Lonchates in the thigh with the
butt-end of a lance, and Makentes in the head
with an axe, and in the shoulder with the shaft
of a pike.


<pb n="230"/>



When Arsakomas, who was with us in the other division, perceived this, he felt that it would
be a shocking thing if he were to go off and leave
his friends behind, so he clapped spurs to his
horse, and, raising a shout, rode through the enemy, waving his sword on high, so that the Machlyëans could not withstand the rush of his
courage, but fell apart and gave way to him to
pass through. When he had recovered his friends
and heartened up the others, he darted upon
Adyrmachos, and, striking him in the neck with
his sword, cleft him to the belt. At his fall the
whole force of the Machyleans fell into disorder,
and then the Alanians and the Greeks followed
suit, so that we began to have the advantage,
and we should have gone on killing for a long
time if night had not robbed us of the business.
On the following day suppliants came from
the enemy asking for peace, the Bosporians promising to pay double their tribute, the Machlyëans
saying that they would give hostages, and the
Alanians agreeing to subdue for us as indemnity
for that invasion, the Sindianoi, who had been at
feud with us for a long time. On these terms we
made a treaty, as had been agreed upon much
earlier by Arsakomas and Lonchates, and peace
was made under the direction of these men.
Such deeds, Mnesippos, the Scythians dare do
for friends.


<pb n="231"/>

TOXARIS.
231
Mnesippos. Very tragical and romance - like.
But may the Sword and the Wind, by whom you
swore, have mercy on me; for I do not think a
man would be much to blame if he should disbelieve your tales.
Toxaris. Beware, my friend, lest your doubt be
envy. Doubt as you will, you will not keep me
from telling other such deeds of Scythians that I
know of.
Mnesippos. Only not at great length, my dear
fellow, nor using such unbridled words. You
abused my silence to run up and down through
Scythia and Machlyëne, and off to the Bosporos
and back again.
Toxaris. I must obey your commands even in
this, and speak briefly lest you weary of following me about with your ears. But hear what
services I myself received from a friend named
Sisinnes. When I left home and went to Athens,
through my desire for a Greek education, I put
in at Amastris, on the Pontos; for ships from
Scythia call there, the city being not far from
Karambis. Sisinnes accompanied me, my friend
from childhood. We spied a sort of lodginghouse near the harbor, and, removing our luggage
into it from the ship, we went out to stroll in the
market - place, suspecting no evil. But in the
mean time some thieves forced the bolt and carried off everything, leaving us not even enough to


<pb n="232"/>



get through the day with.
Now when we came
home and found what had happened, we felt it
would not do to accuse the neighbors, for there
were many of them, or the landlord, for we were
afraid most people would think us sharpers if we
said that some one had robbed us of fifteen hundred dollars, a great deal of clothing, some rugs,
and everything else we had. We considered our
circumstances and what we should do, utterly without resources in a foreign country, and my opinion
was that we had better thrust our swords between
our ribs then and there and die, rather than submit to be shamefully destroyed by hunger and
thirst. But Sisinnes tried to encourage me, and
implored me to do nothing of the sort, for he had
a plan by which we should get food enough. And
for the nonce he took to carrying wood from the
harbor, and returned with provisions bought with
his wages. But early next morning, as he was
walking about the market-place, he saw a kind
of procession, as he said, of noble and beautiful
youths. They were enlisted to fight in single
combat for pay, and the contest was to come off
in three days. He made full inquiries about
them, and then came to me and said, "Don't call
yourself poor any longer, Toxaris, for in three days
I shall prove you rich."
That was all he told me, and we managed to
eke out a wretched existence in the interval.

When the games were about to begin we also
were among the spectators, for Sisinnes dragged
me out, persuading me that it would be a pleasure to see the wonderful Greek games, and
brought me to the theatre. Sitting there we first
saw wild beasts infuriated with darts and then
chased by dogs, or let loose upon bound men,
who, we concluded, were criminals. Then the
single fighters entered, and the herald, bringing
forward a well-grown youth, said that whoever
wished to fight him was to come into the arena
and get two thousand dollars, the wages for fighting. At this Sisinnes rose, and, leaping into the
arena, offered to fight, and asked for weapons.
When he received the money he brought it to
me and gave it into my hands. "If I should
win, Toxaris," he said, "we will go off together
with plenty of money, but if I fall, bury me and
go back to Scythia." Thereupon I cried out, but
he took the armor and put it all on except the
helmet. This he did not wear, but fought bareheaded. The first thing that happened was that
he was wounded, cut under the knee with a
curved sword, so that the blood ran plentifully.
I was already dead in advance with fear. But,
watching his adversary, who came on too boldly,
he struck him on the breast and drove home so
that he went down in an instant between Sisinnes's feet.


<pb n="234"/>



Sisinnes was exhausted himself by his wound,
so that he sat down on the body and almost gave
up his own ghost. But I ran forward, raised
him up and comforted him, and when they had
dismissed him as already the victor I lifted him
and carried him home. After he had been nursed
a long time he survived, it is true, and lives to this
day in Scythia, married to my sister. But, nevertheless, he is lame from his wound. This, Mnesippos, took place neither in Machlyëne nor in
Alania, so as to be unsupported by evidence and
open to disbelief, but many of the folk of Amastris are at hand who remember the contest of
Sisinnes.
When I have told you as my fifth case the
deeds of Abauchas I will stop. This Abauchas
once came into a city of the Borysthenites, bringing with him his wife, whom he loved tenderly,
and two small children, one of them a baby at
the breast and the other a girl seven years old.
A friend of his, Gyndanes, journeyed in company
with him, and he, moreover, was suffering from a
wound he got from robbers who had waylaid
them on the road. For in fighting them he got a
thrust in the thigh, so that he could not even
stand for pain. As they were asleep at night—
they happened to be lodging in an upper story—a
great fire broke out, all means of exit were cut
off, and the flames surrounded the house on every


<pb n="235"/>

TOXARIS.
235
side. Thereupon Abauchas awoke, and he left
his weeping child behind and shook off his wife,
who clung to him, calling to her to save herself;
but he lifted his friend and made his way down,
and was in time to get out through part of the
house not yet entirely seized by the fire. His wife
followed, carrying the baby, and bidding the little
girl come after; but the woman was half-burnt and
let the baby fall from her arm, and barely leaped
through the flame with the little girl, who also had
a narrow escape from death.
When it was afterwards made a reproach to
Abauchas that he had deserted his wife and
children to bring Gyndanes out, he would say,
"It is an easy matter for me to have more children, and it is impossible to know whether they
will be good or not; but it would take me a long
time to find another such friend as Gyndanes,
who has given me great proof of his affection."
These five, Mnesippos, I have chosen from
many to tell you of. And now it should be time
to decide between us whether you are to lose
your tongue or I my right hand. Who, then,
shall be our judge?
Mnesippos. No one, for we did not appoint any
arbiter of the discussion. But do you know what
we shall do? Since we have this time shot our
arrows without a mark, let us choose an umpire
and tell him the stories of other friends, and then


<pb n="236"/>



he who is defeated shall be punished by the loss
of his tongue if it be I, of his right hand if it be
you. Nay, this is barbarous; but since you have
shown yourself an encomiast of friendship, and I,
too, believe that mankind have no better or fairer
possession, why should not we too agree between
ourselves that we are friends now and will be forever, and acquiesce in a common victory, carrying
off the greatest prizes—instead of one tongue or
one right-hand, each gaining two and four eyes
besides, and four feet, and a double allowance of
everything? For when two or three friends join.
they form something like the painters' picture of
Geryon, a man with six hands and three heads.
It strikes me that they were three people acting
in concert as they ought to do, if they are friends.
Toxaris. You are right; let us do so.
Mnesippos. But we need no blood, Toxaris, and
no sword to cement our friendship. For this
present talk of ours and our striving for like
things will be more sure than that cup of which
you drink, since to my mind such matters need
not compulsion but good-will.
Toxaris. I approve. Let us be friends and
hosts from this moment, you to me here in Greece,
and I to you if you should ever come to Scythia.
Mnesippos. I assure you I would cheerfully go
farther yet to find such friends as your words
prove you to be, Toxaris.

I once made a journey to Thessaly,
having a matter of business connected with my paternal estate to
arrange there with a man of that
country. A horse carried me and
my luggage, and a single servant accompanied
me. We followed the usual road, and fell in
with other travellers who happened to be going
to Hypata, a town in Thessaly in which they
lived. We joined company, made our provisions
common stock, and in this way achieved that laborious journey. When we were approaching the
town I asked the Thessalians whether they knew
a resident of Hypata named Hipparchos, for I
had a letter of introduction to him from home
and expected to lodge with him. They said they
did, and told me what part of the town he lived
in, and that, although he had plenty of money, his
household consisted solely of one maid-servant
and his wife. "For," said they, "he is a terrible
miser."
When we had come very near the town we saw
a garden with a tolerable cottage in it, and this
was where Hipparchos dwelt. So the others made


<pb n="240"/>



their adieux and rode on, and I went up to the
door and knocked. After a good deal of difficulty
and delay the woman managed to hear me, and
finally came to the door. I asked whether Hipparchos was at home.
"He is," said she; "but who are you and what
do you want to see him for?"
"I am the bearer of a letter from Dekrianos,
the sophist of Patrai.”
"Wait here," said she, and, closing the door,
she went away.
After a while she came back
and bade us enter. Accordingly, I went into the
house, saluted the master, and presented my letter. It happened that he was just beginning his
dinner, reclining on a narrow couch. His wife
sat near him, and a table stood before them with
nothing on it as yet. As soon as he had cast his
eye over the letter he said: "Dekrianos is my
dearest friend and the noblest Greek of them all.
I take it kindly of him that he sends his own
comrades to me with confidence. You see my
cottage, Loukios; it is small, but it is just the
right size to hold the owner; and you will transform it into a great house, if you will live in it
and put up with it."
"Palaistra,
Then he called the maid-servant.
show the gentleman to a bed-chamber, and bring
him thither what luggage he has. And then direct
him to the bath: he has come a long journey."


<pb n="241"/>

LOUKIOS.
241
At these words the girl Palaistra led the way
and showed a very pretty little sleeping-room.
"That is your bed," said she; "and for your servant I will set a couch alongside and put a pillow
on it." When she had thus spoken we went off
to bathe, and I gave the girl money to buy a little barley for my horse. She carried in all my
belongings and deposited them in my room.
When we had bathed and come back to the
house we presented ourselves immediately, and
Hipparchos, shaking hands with me, bade me
recline beside him. The dinner was not too
frugal, and the wine was pleasant and old. After
dinner we sat talking over our wine-the usual
way of entertaining a guest. That whole evening we spent in drinking, and so to bed.
Next day Hipparchos asked me whither I purposed going next, or whether I was going to stay
there all the time. "I am going on to Larissa,"
said I, "but probably I shall spend four or five
days here." This, however, was a subterfuge. I
had the greatest desire to remain there and
search out one of the women versed in sorcery,
and see some of their marvellous exhibitions—a
human being with wings, or turned into stone;
and I surrendered myself to my passion for such
a sight, and strolled about the town with no idea
how to begin the search, but strolling nevertheless. While I was thus employed I saw a woman
16


<pb n="242"/>



approaching, young still and well to do, as far as
I could judge from a casual meeting. She was
dressed in bright stuffs, had a number of attendants, and displayed an extravagance of gold.
When I came nearer, the lady greeted me and
I returned the salutation.
“You may
"My name is Abroia," she said.
have heard your mother speak of me as a friend.
You, her children, are as dear to me as my own.
Why, then, my child, do you not come to me as
my guest?"
66
Thank you very much," said I, "but I should
be ashamed to desert a friendly man's house when
I have no fault to find with him. But as far as
my inclination is concerned, dear madam, I would
lodge with you."
"Where do you lodge, then?" she asked.
"With Hipparchos."
"The miser?" cried she.
"Don't call him that, madam," said I. "He
has entertained me brilliantly and generously.
Actually, you might accuse him of extravagance."
But the lady smiled, and, taking me by the
hand, led me apart and said to me: "Pray, be
on your guard in every way against Hipparchos's
wife, for she is a powerful sorceress. She casts
a longing eye on all young men, and if one of
them rejects her advances she revenges herself
on him by her arts. Many a one has she turned


<pb n="243"/>

LOUKIOS.
243
into an animal, and many a one destroyed outright. You, my child, are handsome as well as
young, so that you find favor with women at
once ; and you are a stranger, so that there is
no danger in dealing with you."
When I heard that what I had been seeking
so long was living in the same house with me, I
paid no more heed to the lady. As soon as I
could take my leave I made off homeward, saying to myself as I went: "Come, now, you who
say you are eager to see this wonderful sight,
wake up and invent some sage plan to come at
what you want. Practise on Palaistra, the maidservant-for the wife of your host and friend is
sacred; wrestling with her, I assure you, you will
easily learn what you want, for servants know
everything about their masters, good and bad."
Talking thus with myself, I entered the house.
I did not find Hipparchos at home or his wife
either; but Palaistra was sitting by the fire preparing the dinner, and I opened my discourse
forthwith.
"Lovely Palaistra,” said I, “how gracefully
you turn and sway your body and the kettle at
the same time! My marrow melts at the sight.
He is a lucky man who dips his finger in that
dish."
The girl was of a very lively humor and full of
charming ways. "Fly, young man,” said she, “if


<pb n="244"/>



you are in your senses and want to live. I am
made of fire and smoke. If you should but touch
me you will sit here covered with blisters, burned
through by me.
No doctor will heal you, not even
a god, save only me who burned you. Strangest
of all, I will make you suffer the more, and you
will cherish the painful cure and cling to it, and
you would be stoned rather than escape from
your pleasant pain. Why do you laugh? You
see before you a scientific cook of men. These
trumpery eatables are not the only things I can
prepare; no, I know well how to butcher and
flay and carve that great and noble viand, man.
My dearest pleasure is to lay hold of his very
vitals and heart."
"You are perfectly right," I said; "for even
while I was at a distance, before I had come near
you, you not only burned me, by Heavens! but set
me all in a blaze. Through my eyes you flung
your
invisible fire into my vitals and are roasting
me, though I never did you any harm. So, heal
me, in the name of goodness, with those bittersweet remedies you speak of yourself. I am
butchered already; take me and flay me as you
will."
I
At this she burst into a peal of sweet laughter,
and after that she was a complete conquest.
said to her one day, "My dear, get me sight of
your mistress practising her mysteries or changing


<pb n="245"/>

LOUKIOS.
245
her shape. For a long time I have been eager to
see this curious thing. Or, better still, if you
know anything of the black art, exhibit it yourself, and show yourself to me in some other form
than your own. I have a notion that you are not
altogether ignorant of this science, and I know it
from my own heart, not from hearsay; for I used
to be adamantine, the women said, and I never
cast these eyes tenderly on any girl before; but
you laid hold of me by your arts and led me off,
after our loving contest, as the captive of your
spear."
"Stop making fun of me," said Palaistra.
"What incantation could charm Love, since he
is lord of all sorcery? No, sweetheart; I swear
by your head that I know nothing whatever of
these things. I have never learned so much as
my letters, and my mistress is very jealous of her
art. But if I should have a chance, I will try
to show her to you in the act of changing her
shape."
A few days later Palaistra informed me that
her mistress was intending to put on the guise of
a bird and fly off to her lover.
"Now is your time, Palaistra," said I, "to do
me a kindness; for it is in your power to satisfy
the long-cherished desire of your suppliant."
"Never fear," said she. And when it was evening she came for me, and brought me to the door


<pb n="246"/>



of the chamber in which her master and mistress
slept, and bade me stand by a narrow chink in
the door and watch what was going on within.
Well, I saw the lady stripping off her clothes.
When she was naked she advanced to the lamp,
took two grains of incense and cast them on the
flame, and, standing still, addressed a long speech
to it. Then she opened a strong little chest with
a great many boxes in it, lifted one of them and
took it out. I do not know the nature of the
contents, but from its appearance I judged it was
oil. From this box she anointed herself completely, beginning with her finger-nails, and suddenly feathers sprang out on her, her nose grew
horny and curved, and she displayed all the other
properties and traits of a bird. She was nothing
else than a night-hawk. When she was completely feathered she gave a harsh cry like a hawk's,
stood up, and took her flight out of the window.
I thought I must be dreaming such a sight as
this, and rubbed my eyelids with my fingers, not
believing that I had seen with my own waking
eyes. When I had at length with difficulty convinced myself that I was not asleep, I forthwith
begged Palaistra to anoint me, too, with that drug,
and feather me and let me fly; for I wanted to
learn by experiment whether if my human shape
was altered I should have the mind, too, of a bird.
She stealthily opened the bedroom door and


<pb n="247"/>

LOUKIOS.
247
brought the box. I had already made haste to
strip, and I anointed myself from head to toe.
But alas, alack! I did not become a bird! No;
a tail grew out on me behind, my fingers and toes
disappeared somehow, my nails reduced themselves to four and were nothing more nor less
than hoofs, my hands and feet became the feet
of a beast of burden, my ears grew long, and my
face enormous. When I surveyed myself all
over I saw that I was an ass, but I had no human voice left wherewith to blame Palaistra.
However, I stretched out my lower lip, and by
my shape itself and by my sidelong asinine glance
I reproached her as well as I could for having
made me an ass instead of a bird. She smote
her face with both hands. "Wretched girl that
I am," she cried, "what a dreadful thing I have
done! In my hurry I blundered, because the
boxes were so alike, and brought the wrong one,
not the one that makes feathers grow. But cheer
up, do, sweetheart! There is a very easy cure
for this. You have only to eat some roses, and
the beast will immediately fall from you and you
will give me back my lover. Only stay this one
night, dear, in the ass, and at daybreak I will run
and fetch you some roses, and you will eat them
and be cured."
While she spoke thus she stroked my ears and
the rest of my hide. I was an ass in all other


<pb n="248"/>



respects, but I had the heart and mind of a man
-the same Loukios, but not his voice. Well,
heaping silent reproaches on Palaistra for her
mistake, and chewing my lip, I went off to where
I knew my horse was stabled, together with another ass, a real one, belonging to Hipparchos.
When they saw me coming in to join them they
feared that I was going to share their feed, so
they put back their ears and made ready to defend their bellies with their heels. I grasped the
situation, and taking my stand at a distance from
the manger, burst into a laugh, but my laugh was
a bray. Then I said to myself: "Confound my
untimely curiosity! What if a wolf should come
in, too, or some other wild beast! The chances
are that I shall be killed, though I have done
nothing wrong." But though I reflected thus, I
had no idea, poor devil! of the evil that awaited
me.
When the night was already far advanced, with
its great silence and sweet sleep, there was a
noise from without as though the wall were being broken through, and so it was. There was a
hole already large enough to admit a man, and
one man after another made his way through it
promptly until a number were inside, swords in
hand. Then they tied up Hipparchos and Palaistra and my man in their rooms, and so stripped
the house fearlessly, carrying out the money and


<pb n="249"/>

LOUKIOS.
249
the clothes and the furniture. When there was
nothing more left in it, they took me and the other ass and the horse, saddled us, and strapped all
they had stolen onto us. Laden with these heavy
loads, they drove us up the mountain by an untrodden road, beating us with clubs, and bent on
escaping. I am not able to describe the feelings
of the other beasts, but I, for my part-barefoot,
inexperienced, treading on sharp stones, and bearing so much stuff-was ready to die. Every now
and then I stumbled, but I was not at liberty to fall
down, for some one from behind would instantly
give me a blow across the haunches with a club;
and when I frequently longed to cry, "O Caesar!"
I could do nothing but bray. I could bring out
the "O" full and loud, but the "Caesar" would
not follow. And even for this they clubbed me,
because they thought my braying would betray
them. So, when I found that my cries were in
vain, I resolved to go on in silence, with the gain,
at least, of not being beaten.
66
After this day came, and we had already climbed
many mountains. They muzzled us so that we
might not browse along the road for our breakfasts and thus be caught; so for that day, too, I
remained an ass. At high noon we halted at a
sort of farm-house belonging to people who were
friends of the robbers, to judge from what happened, for they greeted each other with kisses,


<pb n="250"/>



and the owners of the house bade the others halt,
and set breakfast before them and gave us animals barley. The others breakfasted, but I fasted in misery. Since I had never at that time
breakfasted on raw barley, I looked around to
see what I could eat. I saw a garden there behind the court-yard, full of fine vegetables, and
above these I saw roses. In the house they were
all occupied with their breakfast, and I managed
to give them the slip and get to the garden, partly to eat my fill of raw vegetables, and partly for
the sake of the roses, for I calculated that if I ate
those flowers I should certainly become a man
again. When I had made my way into the garden I stuffed myself with lettuces, and radishes,
and parsley, such vegetables as men are wont to
eat raw; but those roses were not real ones, they
were such as grow on the wild laurel. The plant
is called rose-laurel, and it makes a poor breakfast for any ass or horse, for it is said that if they
eat it they die on the spot.
In the mean time the gardener perceived me,
snatched up a club, and ran into the garden.
When he saw the enemy, the destroyer of his
vegetables, he seized me as a severe master seizes
a thieving slave and pounded me with his club,
sparing neither ribs nor thighs. He even crushed
my ears and mangled my face. When I could
stand it no longer I kicked with both feet,


<pb n="251"/>

LOUKIOS.
251
knocked him on his back on top of the vegetables, and ran for the mountain. Seeing me making off at a run he shouted that they were to loose
the dogs on my trail. The dogs were numerous
and large enough to fight with bears, and I knew
that if they caught me they would tear me to
pieces. So after I had made a short detour I
decided that the proverb is right, "better run
back than into trouble," and accordingly I started back and made my way to the farm again.
They captured the dogs who had been chasing
me, and tied them up, but me they beat and did
not stop until in my agony I had cast up all the
vegetables.
When it was time to take to the road again they
also heaped most of the booty and the heaviest
on me, and this having been arranged we set out.
I was soon exhausted, what with my beating and
with carrying my load, and my hoofs were crushed
by the road. At this point I made up my mind.
to fall down where I was and never get up again,
though they beat me to death, for I hoped great
gain from this if my plan should work. My idea
was that they would give up in despair, divide my
load between the horse and the mule, and leave
me to lie there for the wolves. But some jealous
divinity perceived my plans and made them work
just the other way. For the other ass followed the
same train of thought as mine and fell down in the


<pb n="252"/>



road. First they took to beating the poor wretch,
bidding him get up; but as he did not respond at
all to the blows, some of them took hold of his
ears and some of his tail and tried to rouse him.
When they were unsuccessful in this, and he lay
like a stone in the road, utterly worn out, they argued among themselves that their efforts were
useless, and that they were wasting their time for
escape sitting by a dead ass; so they took all the
gear he had been carrying and divided it between
me and the horse. As for the wretched partner
of my captivity and burdens, they laid hold of
him, cut the sinews of his legs with a sword, and
thrust him still quivering over the precipice, and
down he went, dancing the death-dance.
When I saw in the case of my fellow-traveller
the outcome of the plans I had formed I made
up my mind to bear my present plight bravely
and plod on with spirit, for I was in hopes that I
might chance on my roses at any turn, and by
their means be restored to myself. And I heard
the robbers saying our journey was almost done,
and that they would stay at their next haltingplace. Accordingly, we carried all that burden at
a quick pace, and before evening we came to their
house. An old woman was sitting inside, where
a great fire was burning. The robbers took all the
things we had been carrying and set them inside.
Then they asked the old woman, “Why in Heav-


<pb n="253"/>

LOUKIOS.
253
en's name are you sitting like this instead of getting our supper ready?"
"Why, everything is ready for you," said the
hag. "Plenty of bread, jars of old wine, and
some game that I have cooked for you.”
Then they fell to praising her, and, taking off
their clothes, anointed themselves before the fire.
There was a jar in the house full of warm water,
from which they drew and poured over themselves,
thus taking a hasty bath. A little later a number of young men arrived, bringing as much gold
and silver and clothing as they could carry, and a
great deal of jewelry, women's and men's. These
were accomplices of the others, and when they
had bestowed their booty within they, too, bathed
in the same manner. After this they had a bountiful supper, and there was a great deal of conversation among the cutthroats over their wine. The
old woman put barley before me and the horse,
and he set to and gulped it down in a hurry, fearing, probably, that I would share it.
But for my
part, whenever I saw the old woman go off I devoured the masters' bread.
The next day one young man was left behind
with the old woman, and all the others went off
on professional business. I bewailed my fate
and this strict guard, for I could despise the old
woman and run away under her very eyes, but the
young man was tall, and had a dangerous look,


<pb n="254"/>



moreover, and he always carried a sword and fastened the door every time he went out.
Three days after this, almost at midnight, the
robbers came back, bringing no gold or silver or
anything else except a very beautiful young girl.
She was in tears, and her clothes were torn and
her hair dishevelled. They deposited her in the
house on the mattresses, bade her cheer up, and
told the old woman to stay inside all the time,
and keep watch over her. The girl would neither eat nor drink; she did nothing but weep
and tear her hair, so that I myself, standing near
by at the manger, wept in sympathy with the beautiful maiden. In the mean time the robbers were
supping in the vestibule. Towards morning one
of the spies, who had been chosen by lot to watch
the roads, came and reported that a stranger was
going to pass that way carrying a great deal of
treasure. The robbers rose up just as they were,
armed themselves, saddled both me and the horse,
and drove us off. I, poor wretch, knew that we
were marching out to battle and murder, and I
advanced reluctantly, whereupon they beat me
with a stick to urge me on. When we came to
the road by which the stranger was to drive, the
robbers fell upon his carriages with one accord,
killed his servants, selected the most valuable articles, and placed them on the horse and me, and
hid the rest of the things there in the wood.


<pb n="255"/>

LOUKIOS.
255
Then they drove us homeward thus laden, and I,
being urged on and beaten with a stick, struck
my foot on a sharp stone, and received a painful
wound from the blow, which made me limp as I
paced the rest of the journey. The robbers said.
to each other, "Why do we keep this ass who
stumbles on everything? Let us throw him over
the precipice, he brings us bad luck." "Yes," said
another, "let us throw him over to be a scapegoat for the gang." And they formed to attack
me. But I, hearing their talk, walked the rest of
the way on my wounded foot as though it belonged to somebody else, for the fear of death
made me insensible to the pain of it.
When we came to our abiding place they took
the booty from our shoulders and put it carefully
away. Then they fell to and dined, and when
night came they went off to secure the rest of the
things. "Why do we take this wretched ass?"
said one of them. "He is useless with his
wounded hoof. We will carry some of the things
and the horse the rest." So they went off, leading the horse. It was a bright moonlit night.
Then I said to myself: "You poor wretch, why
do you stay here any longer? Vultures and the
children of vultures will dine off you. Don't you
hear what they are plotting against you? Do you
want to be thrown over a precipice? It is night
now and there is a bright moon. The robbers


<pb n="256"/>



are off on the road. Fly, and save yourself from
these cutthroat masters."
While I was thus thinking to myself I perceived
that I was not even tied to anything, but that the
halter by which they led me on the road was hanging alongside. This added circumstance spurred
me to the greatest eagerness for flight, and I
emerged at a run and was making off; but when
the old woman saw me on the point of escaping
she seized me by the tail and held on. However, I
said to myself that if I were caught by an old woman I should deserve the precipice and any other
death, and I dragged her. But she shrieked with
all her might to the captive maiden to come out.
She ran forward, and when she saw the old woman
hanging on to the ass like a second Dirke she
found courage for a brave deed and worthy of
desperate youth. She sprang onto my back, seated
herself there, and urged me on. I, fired with love
of freedom and the girl, fled with all my might and
ran like a horse, leaving the old woman behind.
The girl prayed to the gods to grant her a safe
escape, and to me she said: "If you bring me to
my father, my pretty ass, I will free you from all
labor, and you shall have a bushel of barley every
day for breakfast." I ran on, quite forgetting my
wound in my eagerness to escape my murderers,
and the hope of getting plenty of assistance and
attention if I should save the maiden.

But when we came to where the road split into
three the enemy met us on their homeward way.
They recognized their unhappy prisoners in the
moonlight while we were still at a distance, ran
up to us, and laid hold of me, saying: "Oho, my
fine madam, where are you going at this unseasonable hour, you poor, suffering thing? Aren't
you even afraid of ghosts? Come home with us
and we will hand you over to your friends." This
they said with a sardonic laugh, and they turned
me about and dragged me back. Then I remembered my lame foot and fell to limping. "What,"
said they, "are you lame now because you were
caught running away? When your mind was set
on flight you were sound and flew on wings,
swifter than a horse." These words were followed by the stick, and I got a wound on my
thigh at once as a warning.
When we turned into our lodging again we
found the old woman hanging from a stone by a
cord. Apparently she had been so afraid of her
masters when they should discover the girl's
flight that she had hanged herself. They spoke
admiringly of her courage, cut her down, and threw
her over the precipice with the cord round her
neck. The girl they tied up inside the house, and
then they supped and drank heavily. Meanwhile
they began at once to talk with each other about
the girl.

<pb n="258"/>



"What shall we do with the runaway?" asked
one of them.
"There is nothing to do," said another, "but
throw her down on top of our old woman.
She
has robbed us of as much treasure as she could,
and was on her way to betray our whole establishment. For be assured, my friends, that if she
had reached her kinsmen not one of us would
have been left alive, for our enemies would have
fallen on us with every preparation and captured
us all. So let us take our revenge on the foe,
but not by giving her such an easy death as falling onto the rock. Let us invent for her the
most painful and lingering death, and one that
will only kill her after keeping her a prisoner in
long torment."
Then they set themselves to think out a form
of death, and some one said, “I know you will
applaud my invention. We must kill the ass who
is a nuisance, and, moreover, pretends at present
to be lame, and helped and ministered to the girl's
flight into the bargain. Let us slaughter him,
then, early in the morning, cut open his belly,
take out all his vitals, and place this virtuous
maiden in the ass. We will let her head project
so that she may not be stifled at once, but all the
rest of her body shall be hidden inside. Then
we will stitch her securely in and throw them
both out to the vultures, preparing them a novel

breakfast. Note, my friends, the horror of the
torture: in the first place, to live in the dead body
of an ass, then to bake with the beast in the hottest sun of summer, and to die of lingering starvation, unable even to strangle herself. And,
finally, the vultures will make their way in through
the ass, and tear her flesh along with his while she
is yet alive."
A general shout of applause greeted this monstrous idea as though it were something delightful; but I bewailed my lot. I was destined to be
slaughtered, and not even after death to lie a
peaceful corpse, but to serve as the tomb of an
unhappy and innocent girl.
But before day had fairly come a crowd of soldiers suddenly appeared who had come to attack
these villians, and they forthwith clapped them
all in irons and carried them off to the governor
of the country. And it happened that the girl's
fiancé came with them, for it was he that had given information as to the whereabouts of the robbers' headquarters. So he took charge of the girl,
set her on my back, and led her thus to her home.
When the villagers caught sight of us still at a
distance they knew the expedition was successful, for I brayed the good tidings to them, and
they ran to meet us, embraced us, and led us in.
The young girl had a great deal to say about
me, doing justice to her partner in captivity, in


<pb n="260"/>



flight, and in the danger of that common death.
And by my mistress's orders a breakfast was set
before me, consisting of a bushel of barley and
hay enough for a camel. But it was then most
of all that I cursed Palaistra for having changed
me into an ass by her art and not into a dog, for
I saw the dogs sneaking into the kitchen and
gorging themselves with plenty of food, such as
is served at the wedding-banquet of a wealthy
pair. A few days after the marriage my mistress
declared in her father's presence that she was indebted to me, and longed to make me a just return; whereupon he gave orders to turn me out to
grass in the pasture with the mares. "For if he
is at liberty," said he, "he will enjoy life." And
this recompense would have seemed perfectly just
if the matter had come before an ass as judge.
So he called one of the grooms and handed me
over to him, and I was delighted at the prospect
of doing no more work.
When we arrived at the farm the herdsman put
me with the mares, and led the drove of us into
the pasture. But even here it was fated that I
should have the same experience as Kandaules;
for the man in charge of the mares left me in
the possession of his wife, Megapole, for domestic service, and she harnessed me in the mill, and
made me grind wheat and barley at her bidding.
It is true that it was no great evil to a grateful ass

261
to turn a mill for his own masters, but the worthy
woman hired out my wretched neck to the other
peasants of the district, who were numerous, taking her pay in flour. And she would also roast
the barley allowed me for my breakfast, put it before me for me to grind, make cakes of it, and eat
them whole, leaving me to breakfast on the bran.
So I grew thin and ugly in a short time, for I had
no.comfort in-doors at the mill, nor out-of-doors
in the pasture, because my fellow-grazers fought
with me. Moreover, I was often sent up into
the mountain to fetch wood on my shoulders, and
this was the crown of my sorrows. In the first
place, there was a high mountain to be climbed
by a terribly straight road, and in the second
place, I was barefoot on a steep and stony path.
Besides this they sent with me as driver a wretch
of a small boy, who found a new way to torture
me every time. First he used to flog me even
when I was trotting faster than I should, and not
with a trimmed stick, but one covered with sharp
knots. He always used to strike the same spot
on my haunch, so that he opened a wound there
with his club, and he always aimed at the sore
place. His next idea was to lay a burden on me
that would have been too heavy for an elephant.
The descent from the mountain was steep, but
even there he used to flog me. And if he saw
that my load had slipped and was hanging to one


<pb n="262"/>



side, so that some of the sticks ought to be taken
off and added to the lighter side to make it balance, he would by no means proceed in this way.
No; he would lift great stones from the mountainside and put them on the side of my fardel that
was lighter and slipping up, and I would go on,
poor wretch, carrying in addition to the wood an
equal weight of useless stones. Moreover, there
was a stream that crossed the road and was never dry, and the boy, to save wetting his shoes, used
to perch on my back behind the wood, and thus
cross the river.
If ever I fell down, worn out with carrying my
load, that would be the occasion of unendurable
suffering. He who ought to have dismounted
and given me the assistance of his hand by raising me from the earth, and, if need were, taking
off my load, would neither get down nor lift a finger to help me, but from his seat he would batter
me with his stick, beginning at my head and ears,
until the blows aroused me. And he played an
even more intolerable trick on me than this. He
collected a fagot of the sharpest thorns, tied
them with a cord, and hung them behind on my
tail. As may be imagined, they dangled and fell
forward against me as I descended the mountain
and pricked my hind-quarters till they were covered with wounds. I was helpless to protect myself, for the source of my pain followed me at


<pb n="263"/>

LOUKIOS.
263
each step, hanging from my own body. If I advanced gingerly to avoid the thorns I was halfkilled with the club; if I shunned the club then
that horror at my back attacked me sharply. In
fact, my
driver's one object in life was to kill me.
Once, when I could no longer bear my many
cruel sufferings, I let out at him with my heels,
and he never forgot that kick. He was ordered
one day to carry some tow from one village to
another, so he took me, collected a mass of tow,
tied it on my back, and made it fast with an additional and painful strap, brewing a fearful plot
against me as he adjusted the load. When it was
time to start he stole an ember still hot from the
hearth, and when we were at some distance from
the house he hid it in the tow. The tow immediately burst into flame-for what else would it
do?—and my load was nothing but a huge conflagration. I saw that I should be roasted in an
instant, and, coming upon a deep mud-hole in the
road, I flung myself into the wettest part of it.
There I rolled the tow, and twisted and turned
myself until I had sprinkled that hot and painful
burden with mud. Then I made the rest of the
journey with more safety, for the boy could not
set me on fire any more because the tow was
mixed with mud. And when he arrived he had
the impudence to tell this lie about me: that I
had plunged into the fireplace of my own accord


<pb n="264"/>



as I was passing it. Well, that time I survived
the tow, though I did not expect to; but the villain of a boy invented something much worse
than this for me. He took me up the mountain
and put a great load of wood on me, but this he
sold to a neighboring farmer, and drove me home
with no load and no wood, and accused me falsely
to his master. "I don't see the good, sir," said
he, "of supporting this ass, for he is terribly lazy
and slow." When the master heard this he said,
"Well, if he is willing neither to walk nor to carry a load, kill him and give his vitals to the dogs,
but save his flesh for the work-people, and if any
questions are asked as to the manner of his death
lay it to the wolf." The rascally boy, my driver,
was charmed, and was for killing me at once, but
in the dead of night a messenger came from the
village to the farm, saying that the bride, the one
who was stolen by the robbers, had been walking
with her bridegroom late in the evening on the
sea-shore, when suddenly the sea rose, caught
them, and carried them out of sight, and that this
was the end of their happiness and their agony.
This news, that the house was bereft of its young
master and mistress, determined the farm-people
to live in slavery no longer. They laid their
hands on everything in the house and fled. The
master of the horses took me, too, collected all
the goods he could, and packed them on me and


<pb n="265"/>

LOUKIOS.
265
the mares. I was put out at having to carry the
load of a real ass, but I was glad to accept this
trial in place of the knife.
We travelled all night over a painful road, and
in three days more we finished our journey and
came to Beroia, a large and populous town in
Macedonia. There our drivers determined to
settle us and themselves, and we beasts were sold
at auction by a loud-voiced crier in the middle
of the market-place. The by-standers wished to
open our mouths and look at them, and they saw
the age of each by his teeth. They bought the
others one by one, but I was left last of all, and
the auctioneer bade them take me home again.
See," he said, "this fellow only has found no
master."
66
But fickle Nemesis who whirls our fortunes
constantly about brought a master even to me,
such as I should not have prayed for. He was
an old rascal of the sort who carry the Syrian
goddess around among the villages and farms,
and make her beg. This man bought me at the
handsome price of six dollars! When we arrived
at Philebos's lodging—for this was my purchaser's name he shouted in a loud voice, just before the door, "Little girls, I have bought you a
slave, a handsome, stout Cappadocian." These
"little girls" were a crowd of abandoned men,
coadjutors of Philebos, and they all applauded in


<pb n="266"/>



answer to his shout, for they thought he had really made a human purchase. But when they saw
his slave was an ass they jeered Philebos and
burst out laughing.
The next day they got ready for work, as they
expressed it, prepared the goddess, and set her
on my back. Then we marched out of the city
and tramped about the country.
Whenever we
came into a village, I, the bearer of the goddess,
halted, the crowd of flute players blew a frenzied
strain, and the others, tearing off their Oriental
head-dresses, bending their heads and twisting
their necks, would cut their arms with their swords,
and each thrusting his tongue outside his teeth,
would cut that, too, so that in a moment they
would be covered with fresh blood. When I saw
these doings I at first stood trembling lest the
goddess might sometime have need of asses' blood,
too. But after they had mutilated themselves in
this way they collected coppers and small silver
coins from the surrounding spectators. Some one
might add figs and cheese and a jar of wine, or a
bushel of wheat or barley for the ass.
By these
means the company provided for their own maintenance and the service of the goddess whom I
carried.
Towards evening one day we halted at the
farm of a rich man. The master was at home,
received the goddess in his house with much


<pb n="267"/>

LOUKIOS.
267
pleasure, and offered sacrifices to her. I am still
mindful of the terrible danger I was in at that
house, for the proprietor had received as a present from one of his friends a haunch of wild ass.
The cook took possession of it to dress it, but by
his carelessness it was lost, for a crowd of dogs
contrived to steal in where it was. The man was
so terrified at the storm of blows and the torture
he would get for the loss of the haunch that he
determined to hang himself by the neck. But
his wife, who was my heavy curse, said, "Nay,
dearest, don't take your own life or give way to
such despair. Be guided by me and all will go
well. Take these rascals' ass out to a lonely spot,
then kill him, cut off this quarter, the haunch,
bring it here, dress it and serve it to your master,
throwing the rest of the creature down some
precipice. They will think he has run away
somewhere and got lost. You see how fat he is,
and how much better in every way than that wild
one."
66
The cook praised the woman's idea. A happy
thought, wife," said he. “It is my only way to
escape a flogging, and it shall be done immediately." Thus did the wretch who was to be my
cook plot with his wife, standing in my presence.
But when I saw what was going to happen, I
made a strong resolve to save myself from the
knife; so, breaking the halter they led me by, I


<pb n="268"/>



leaped out and entered at a run the room where
the rascals were seated at table with the proprietor of the farm. Running in thither, I pranced
about and overturned everything, lamp and tables
together. I thought I had invented in this a
clever means of safety, and that the proprietor
would forthwith order me to be locked up where
I could be guarded safely as an unruly ass. But
this piece of cleverness brought me into the extremest danger. They thought I was mad, armed
themselves with plenty of swords and lances and
thick sticks, and got ready to kill me. When I
saw what great peril I was in, I ran past them into
the room where my masters were to sleep, and,
seeing this, they closed the doors carefully from
the outside.
As soon as day dawned I received the goddess
on my back again, and set out in company with
the begging priests, and we came to another village, large and populous, where they announced
something even more striking than usual in the
way of hocus-pocus-namely, that the goddess
would not stay in the house of a man, but would
occupy the temple of the most highly honored
local goddess they had. The people received the
foreign goddess very gladly, and lodged her with
their own.
To us they assigned lodgings with a
poor family. When my masters had made a long
stay here they desired to go on to the neighbor-


<pb n="269"/>

LOUKIOS.
269
ing city, and asked their goddess back from the
villagers. They entered the sacred precincts
themselves, brought her away, set her on my
back, and drove me off. But, as luck would have
it, the profane wretches had used the occasion of
entering this temple to steal a votive vessel of
gold, which they carried off hidden under the goddess. As soon as the villagers discovered what
had happened they gave chase; when they came
near they leaped down from their horses, arrested
them in the road, accused them of sacrilege and
temple-robbing, and demanded the stolen offering. Searching everywhere they found it in the
lap of the goddess. So they bound the wretches,
led them back, and cast them into prison. The
goddess whom I carried they took and placed in
another temple, and the golden vessel they restored to the local goddess.
The next day they decided to sell the prisoners' goods and me, and they disposed of me to a
stranger from a neighboring village, a baker by
trade. He took possession of me, bought ten
bushels of wheat, which he placed on my back,
and drove me home to his own house over a hard
road. When we arrived he led me into the mill,
where I beheld a great crowd of beasts, my fellow-slaves, and a great number of mills, all turned by them, and everything was covered with
flour. They left me there in idleness that day,


<pb n="270"/>



seeing that I was a new slave, and had come
over a hard road carrying a heavy burden. But
on the morrow they covered my eyes with a bandage, harnessed me to the shaft of the mill, and
then started me up. Although I knew how to
work a mill from much experience, I feigned ignorance; but my hopes were vain, for a number
of the millers seized clubs and surrounded me;
and when I was not expecting it—for I could not
see-they pounded me with one accord, and such
was the effect of their blows that I suddenly began to whirl round like a top. And I learned by
experiment that it will not do for a slave to wait
for the master's hand before he does his work.
Well, I grew very thin and weak in body, till
my master decided to sell me, and he disposed
of me to a man who was a market-gardener by
trade, for he had rented a garden to cultivate.
This was our daily work: My master would load
me with vegetables early in the morning, and take
them to the market. Having disposed of them
to the dealers, he would drive me back to the
garden. Then he would fall to digging and planting and watering, while I stood idle. Still this
life was terribly hard for me. In the first place,
when winter came my master could not afford
coverings for himself, and still less for me; and
I trod barefoot through the slimy mud and over
the hard, rough, frozen roads; and the only food


<pb n="271"/>

LOUKIOS.
271
for man and beast alike was lettuces, hard and
bitter.
One day, when we were setting out for the
town, we happened upon a fine-looking man in a
soldier's uniform, who began to address us in the
Latin tongue, and asked the gardener whither he
was driving me, the ass. My master, not understanding the language, I suppose, made no reply.
The other grew angry at what he thought an insult, and struck with his whip at the gardener,
who thereupon closed with him, twirled him off
his legs, and stretched him in the road. As he
lay there he pounded him with hands and feet,
and a stone from the road. The soldier at first
resisted, and threatened that when he got on his
feet he would kill the gardener with his sword;
but my master, being thus instructed from the
very lips of his foe, chose the safer part, drew
the sword from him and hurled it to a distance.
Then he fell to pounding him again where he lay.
The soldier, seeing that his plight was already
past bearing, pretended to be killed by the blows.
This frightened the gardener, so that he left him
lying there just as he was, carried off the sword,
and rode away on me to the town.
When we were arrived there he confided the
charge of the garden to a partner of his, and,
fearing possible danger from the affair in the
road, he hid himself and me in the house of one


<pb n="272"/>



of his friends in the town. The next day they
laid their plans and acted as follows: my master
they concealed in a chest; me they hung by the
feet, and carried me up a ladder to the second
story, and shut me up there. The soldier, as we
heard afterwards, picked himself up out of the
road with difficulty when we were gone, and made
his way into the city, stunned with the beating he
had had. When he found the soldiers of his
company, he told them of the gardener's madness, and they, accompanying him, learned our
hiding-place. They brought the magistrates of
the city with them, who sent some of their people
into the house and bade all within come out.
When they appeared, the gardener was nowhere
to be seen. The soldiers, however, declared he
was in the house with me, his ass, but the people
of the house said no other creature was left inside, either man or ass. At this an uproar of vociferation rose in the narrow street, and I, in my
headstrong curiosity about everything, longed to
know who were shouting, so I peeped down from
above through the window. As soon as they saw
me they raised an outcry. The people of the
house were detected in their lie, and the magistrates, entering and ransacking everything, found
my master lying in the chest. Him they arrested
and packed off to prison, to give an account of
his desperate conduct, and me they brought down

into inextinguishable laughter at my having given.
information from the upper story and betrayed
my own master, and I was the origin, on this occasion, of the proverb about the "peeping ass."
I do not know what happened the next day to
my master the gardener, but the soldier determined to sell me, and parted with me for five dollars. The purchaser was a servant to a very rich
man of Thessalonika, the largest town in Macedonia. His trade was to cook meats for his master, and he had a brother, a fellow-slave, who
understood bread - baking and the flavoring of
honey - cakes. These brothers were messmates
always, lodged in the same house, held the tools
of their trade as common property, and finally installed me, too, in their lodging. After the master's dinner these two used to bring home a quantity of fragments, the one of meats and fish, the
other of bread and cakes. They would shut me
in with these, leaving me the delightful task of
guarding them while they went to bathe. And I,
bidding farewell with all my heart to my portion
of barley, would devote myself to the skill and
earnings of my masters, and so for a long time
I revelled in human food. At first, when they
returned, they used to take no notice of my carnivorous tendency, because there was such a multitude of dishes, and because I still stole my din-
18


<pb n="274"/>



ner with fear and discretion. But when at last
I perceived their unconsciousness, I used to eat
up the choicest morsels and a great deal beside.
Then they began to notice their loss, and each at
first looked suspiciously at the other, and called
him thief, robber of common goods, lost to all
sense of honor, and after that they both grew
careful, and counted the morsels.
The effect on me was that by living this pleasant and luxurious life I grew handsome again in
body from having my natural food, and my hide
shone with a fresh growth of hair. But my most
worthy masters, when they saw me growing fat
and sleek, although my barley was not consumed,
but remained of the same amount, began to suspect my audacity. So they went out as if going
to the bath, closed the doors, and applied their
eyes to a crack and watched what went on within. Innocent of the fraud, I forthwith advanced
and took my dinner. They first burst out laughing at sight of the incredible meal. Then they
called the other slaves to see me, and there was
a general laugh, so that the master himself heard
it, because it made such an uproar outside, and
asked what the joke was out there.
When he

ter as a thief and glutton in one, but he laughed
at me for a long time, and began by ordering me
to be led in to his supper-party. There he bade
them set a table for me, and put on it all sorts
of things, such as no other ass could eat-meats,
oysters, soup, fish—some dressed with caviare and
olive-oil, and some sprinkled with mustard. I,
when I saw fortune smiling sweetly on me, and
perceived that this foolery only could save me,
stood at the table and dined, though I had already made a hearty meal. The company shouted with laughter, and somebody said, "This ass
drinks wine, too, if any one will pour some out
for him." So the master ordered it, and I drank
what was offered me.
He perceived, as you may suppose, that I was
a remarkable creature, and ordered one of his
stewards to pay my price to the man who had
bought me, and as much again, and he handed
me over to a young freedman of his establishment, bidding him instruct me in whatever would
make me most diverting
him. The young
man found the task easy, for I obeyed instantly
every instruction. First he made me recline on
a couch, leaning on my elbow like a man. Then
he taught me to wrestle with him, and actually to
dance, standing upright on my hind-feet, and to
nod my head or shake it in answer to questions,
and a number of other things-all of which I


<pb n="276"/>



could have done even without teaching. And
the report spread far and wide that my master
had an ass who drank wine, wrestled, danced—
most surprising of all, nodded and shook his
head appropriately when spoken to, and, when he
was thirsty, summoned the butler by a movement
of his eyes. The spectators wondered at the
thing as a marvel, not knowing that a man was
shut up in the ass, and I made a fat living out
of their ignorance. I learned to amble and carry
my master on my back, galloping with a pace so
gentle that the rider hardly perceived the motion.
My harness was superb. I wore a purple saddlecloth, my bit was inlaid with gold and silver, and
I was hung with bells which made the sweetest
music.
As I have said, Menekles, our master, was from
Thessalonika, and had come to this place to
make arrangements for a spectacle he had promised his countrymen of men skilled to fight with
weapons in single combat. The gladiators were
by this time secured, and the party set out. We
started at early morning, and I carried my master
whenever a stretch of road was rough and hard
for the carriages to traverse. When we arrived
in Thessalonika every one was eager for the exhibition and for a sight of me, for my renown
had preceded me from afar, and the report of
my versatility and manlike gifts of dancing and


<pb n="277"/>

LOUKIOS.
277
wrestling. My master displayed me to the most
distinguished of his townsmen over their wine,
and made those amazing frolics of mine an accessary of the dinner. But the man in charge of
me made an income of a good many dollars out
of me.
He used to lock me up in a room, and
when people wished to see me and my incredible
performances he would open the door on payment
of a fee. They used to bring in all sorts of eatables, particularly such as were considered revolting to an ass's stomach, but I ate them all, so
that in a few days, by dining with my master and
the townsfolk, I had already grown large and
terribly fat.
Finally that day arrived which was to bring
such distinction to my master. They decided to
exhibit me in the theatre, and this was the manner of my appearance. A large couch was prepared, wrought of Indian tortoise-shell fastened
with bolts of gold. I was laid on it, and in this
posture placed on a machine of some sort, transported to the theatre, and deposited in the middle
amid shouts of applause and a universal clapping
of hands. A table was spread for me, and many
dishes were set on it such as human epicures
have for dinner. Slave boys stood in attendance,
handsome cup-bearers who served me with wine
in a golden cup. The man in charge of me, who
was standing behind, bade me eat my dinner,


<pb n="278"/>



But I was divided between shame at being exposed in the theatre and fear lest, perchance, a
bear or a lion should leap in.
At this moment some one passed by carrying
flowers, and among the others I saw the leaves
of freshly-gathered roses. Without an instant's
hesitation I sprang up and jumped from the
couch. The spectators thought I was getting up
to dance, but I fell upon the flowers, tore one
from another, selected the roses, and swallowed
them. And while the audience were still wondering at me, that beast's form fell from me and
vanished, the whilom ass disappeared, and to my
joy Loukios himself stood there naked. At this
incredible and most unexpected sight the company broke into great uproar in their terror, and
two opposing parties formed in the theatre. For
some thought I ought to be burned on the spot as
a master of unholy potions and a devil of many
shapes, but others said it was only fair to wait for
my account of myself and to hear the case first,
and then decide on it. For my part, I ran to the
governor of the province, who happened to be
present at the exhibition, and told him from below that the Thessalian serving-maid of a Thessalian woman had made an ass of me by anointing me with magic ointment, and I prayed him to
put me under guard until I should persuade him.
that I had told him my true history.

"Tell us your name," said the governor, “and
the names of your parents and relatives, if you
have any, and your city."

'Sire," said I, my name is Loukios, and my
brother's name is Gaios. As to our family names,
we have the same. I am a writer of histories
and other works, and my brother is an elegiac
poet and a skilful diviner. Our birthplace is
Patrai, in Achaia."
When the magistrate heard this he cried, "You
are the son of a family who are very dear to me,
and my guest-friends. They have entertained me
in their house and given me presents, and I know
you tell the truth, since you are a child of theirs."
And he sprang from his seat, embraced me,
kissed me again and again, and conducted me to
his home. At this juncture my brother also
arrived, bringing me money and many other
things. Thereupon the governor declared me
free officially in the presence of the people, and
we went down to the sea, looked out a ship, and
put our luggage aboard. Then we sailed away
from the city with a favorable wind, and a few
days later I arrived in my native land. There I
offered a sacrifice to the gods, my saviors, and
set up a votive offering, since I had been brought
home, and after long wanderings, and with great
difficulty, saved—not out of the lion's jaws, by
Heaven, but out of the curiosity of the ass.

Chairephon. What is the cry,
Sokrates, that comes to us from the distant breakers on the headland yonder? How sweet it sounds! What
creature has such a note as that?
Surely the water-fowl are voiceless.
Sokrates. Nay, it is a sea-bird, Chairephon,
called the halcyon, full of plaints and tears, and
a legend about her has long been current among
men. They say that she was once a woman, the
daughter of Aiolos, son of Hellen, and married
to Ceyx the Trachinian, who was the son of the
Morning-star, fair son of a fair father. And
when her young husband died she mourned for
him, longing for his love. Then by some god's
will (they say) she took on the feathery guise of
a bird, and flits about the seas seeking him; for
she could not find him on the land, though she
searched the world over.
Chairephon. Is this, then, the halcyon? I had
never heard the note before, and it fell upon my
ear like something quite new.
Certainly the

bird may it be, Sokrates?

Sokrates. Small, and yet her wifely love won
great honor from the gods; for in the nestingtime of these birds the world observes the "halcyon days," as they are called, which bring an
interval of fine weather in midwinter. To-day is
a perfect example of them. Do you not see how
clear the air is? and the expanse of sea, how
waveless and calm! Like a mirror, one might
say.
Chairephon. Yes; this certainly seems to be a
halcyon day, and yesterday was just such another.
But tell me, Sokrates, how in the name of the
gods can we possibly believe those old stories
that tell of birds changing into women or women
into birds? All those things seem to the last
degree impossible.
Sokrates. My dear Chairephon, I suspect that
we are altogether too dull of vision to judge of
the possible and the impossible; for we reason
according to our human ability, which cannot
know or see or be believed. And many things,
even easy ones, seem difficult to us, and accessible things seem out of reach, often because our
minds are inexperienced, and often, too, because
they are childish. For every man, even if he be
very old, seems like a child, since certainly our
life is a tiny thing, and short as childhood in
comparison with all time. And how, my friend,
can men, who are ignorant of the powers of the


<pb n="285"/>

THE HALCYON.
285
gods and other divine beings, affirm whether any
such thing is possible or impossible? You saw,
Chairephon, what a storm there was three days
ago. It actually terrifies one even to recall those
flashes of lightning and peals of thunder and the
extraordinary violence of the wind. One would
have thought the whole world was on the eve of
dissolution. But presently there was a marvellous change, and the fine weather set in which
has lasted ever since. Now, which do you think
the greater and more laborious task-to bring
such clear weather out of that irresistible whirlwind and chaos, or to remodel a woman's shape
and make it into a bird's? Why, even human
children who understand modelling will often
take a bit of clay or wax, and easily fashion different shapes in succession from the same lump.
To the godhead, then, whose great superiority
over our powers is beyond comparison, all these
things are perhaps easy and without effort. For
by how much do you think the whole sky surpasses you in size? Will you tell me that?
Chairephon. What mortal, Sokrates, could think
or tell such a thing as that? It is not in our
power so much as to name it.
Sokrates. And do we not see, even in comparing
men with one another, great differences in ability? Compare, for instance, a man grown with
a young child five or ten days old. It is amazing


<pb n="286"/>



how they differ in their powers, for almost all the
actions of life, both those that are performed by
means of our ingenious arts and those of the
body and soul; for it seems impossible for them
to enter even into the mind of a child as young
as that. And as for the strength of one adult
man, it surpasses that of a child immeasurably,
for one man could easily overpower any number
of children, since it seems that by nature we have
always in early life a time of perfect helplessness
and impotence.
Now, seeing that man apparently differs from
man to such a degree, how shall we suppose the
whole heaven compares with our powers in the
eyes of those that attain to such vision? It will
probably seem likely to many that the power and
understanding and reason of the universe are as
much in excess of what Sokrates or Chairephon
has as its size surpasses that of our bodies.
Moreover, many things that are impossible to
others are easy to you and me and hosts of men
like us, and even the arts of flute-playing and
reading and writing are more impossible to the
uninstructed, until they learn them, than making
birds into women or women into birds. Nature,
we may say, deposits a footless, wingless creature
in the honey-comb. Then she sets it upon feet,
and gives it wings, and makes it bright with the
bravery of many varying colors, and lo! it is a

bee, a clever maker of honey fit for the gods.
And from voiceless, lifeless eggs she forms all
sorts of flying and walking and swimming creatures, employing, as some hold, divine arts of the
boundless air. Seeing, then, that the powers of
the immortals are vast, and that we are mortal
and altogether tiny and unable to understand.
either great or small or even to cope with most of
those things that concern ourselves, we can give
no sure opinion about either halcyons or nightingales.
But the famous story of thy lays, melodious
mourner, I will hand down to my children as I
received it from my fathers, and I will often
chant thy dutiful, wifely love to my wives, Xanthippe and Myrto, and tell them all, but chiefly
what glory the gods gave thee.
You will do likewise, will you not, Chairephon?
Chairephon. Yes, Sokrates; and what you have
said may fitly be a double encouragement of love
between man and wife.
Sokrates. Then it is high time for us to say
farewell to Halkyone and set out from Phaleron
towards the town.
Chairephon. Very well; I am ready.
