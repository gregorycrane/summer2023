<head>A Chapter of AUTOBIOGRAPHY</head>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="1">
<p>

When my childhood was over, and I had just left school, my father called a council to decide upon my profession. Most of his friends considered that the life of culture was very exacting in toil, time, and money: a life only for fortune’s favourites; whereas our resources were quite narrow, and urgently called for relief. If I were to take up some ordinary handicraft, I should be making my own living straight off, instead of eating my father’s meat at my age; and before long my earnings would be a welcome contribution.

</p></div>


<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="2">
<p>So the next step was to select the most satisfactory of the handicrafts; it must be one quite easy to acquire, respectable, inexpensive as regards plant, and fairly profitable. Various suggestions were made, according to the taste and knowledge of the councillors; but my father turned to my mother’s brother, supposed to be an excellent statuary, and said to him:
‘With you here, it would be a sin to prefer any other craft; take the lad, regard him as your charge, teach him to handle, match, and grave your marble; he will do well enough; you know he has the ability.’ This he had inferred from certain tricks I used to play with wax. When I got out of school, I used to scrape off the wax from my tablets and work it into cows, horses, or even men and women, and he thought I did it creditably; my masters used to cane me for it, but on this occasion it was taken as evidence of a natural faculty, and my modelling gave them good hopes of my picking up the art quickly.

</p></div>


<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="3">
<p>As soon as it seemed convenient for me to begin, I was handed over to my uncle, and by no means reluctantly;
I thought I should find it amusing, and be in a position to impress my companions; they should see me chiselling gods and making little images for myself and my favourites. The usual first experience of beginners followed: my uncle gave me a chisel, and told me to give a gentle touch to a plaque lying on the bench: ‘Well begun is half done,’ said he, not very originally. In my inexperience I brought down the tool too hard, and the plaque broke; he flew into a rage, picked up a stick which lay handy, and gave me an introduction to art which might have been gentler and more encouraging; so I paid my footing with tears.

</p></div>


<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="4">
<p>I ran off, and reached home still howling and tearful, told the story of the stick, and showed my bruises. I said a great deal about his brutality, and added that it was all envy: he was afraid of my being a better sculptor than he. My mother was very angry, and abused her brother roundly; as for me, I fell asleep that night with my eyes still wet, and sorrow was with me till the morning.

</p></div>


<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="5">
<p>So much of my tale is ridiculous and childish. What you have now to hear, gentlemen, is not so contemptible, but deserves an attentive hearing; in the words of Homer,

<l>To me in slumber wrapt a dream divine</l>
<l>Ambrosial night conveyed,</l>

a dream so vivid as to be indistinguishable from reality; after all these years, I have still the figures of its persons in my eyes, the vibration of their words in my ears; so clear it all was.

</p></div>


<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="6">
<p>Two women had hold of my hands, and were trying vehemently and persistently to draw me each her way; I was nearly pulled in two with their contention; now one would prevail and all but get entire possession of me, now I would

fall to the other again. All the time they were exchanging loud protests: ‘He is mine, and I mean to keep him;’ ‘Not yours at all, and it is no use your saying he is.’ One of them seemed to be a working woman, masculine looking, with untidy hair, horny hands, and dress kilted up; she was all powdered with plaster, like my uncle when he was chipping marble. The other had a beautiful face, a comely figure, and neat attire. At last they invited me to decide which of them I would live with; the rough manly one made her speech first.

</p></div>


<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="7">
<p>‘Dear youth, I am Statuary—the art which you yesterday began to learn, and which has a natural and a family claim  upon you. Your grandfather’ (naming my mother’s father)
‘and both your uncles practised it, and it brought them credit. If you will turn a deaf ear to this person’s foolish cajolery, and come and live with me, I promise you wholesome food and good strong muscles; you shall never fear envy, never leave your country and your people to go wandering abroad, and you shall be commended not for your words, but for your works.

</p></div>


<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="8">
<p>‘Let not a slovenly person or dirty clothes repel you; such were the conditions of that Phidias who produced the Zeus of Polyclitus who created the Hera, of the muchlauded Myron, of the admired Praxiteles; and all these are worshipped with the Gods. If you should come to be counted among them, you will surely have fame enough for yourself through all the world, you will make your father the envy of all fathers, and bring your country to all men’s notice.’ This and more said Statuary, stumbling along in a strange jargon, stringing her arguments together in a very earnest manner, and quite intent on persuading me. But I can remember no more; the greater part of it has faded from my memory. When she stopped, the other’s turn came.

</p></div>


<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="9">
<p>‘And I, child, am Culture, no stranger to you even now, though you have yet to make my closer acquaintance. The

advantages that the profession of a sculptor will bring with it you have just been told; they amount to no more than being a worker with your hands, your whole prospects in life limited to that; you will be obscure, poorly and illiberally paid, meanspirited, of no account outside your doors; your influence will never help a friend, silence an enemy, nor impress your countrymen; you will be just a worker, one of the masses, cowering before the distinguished, truckling to the eloquent, living the life of a hare, a prey to your betters. You may turn out a Phidias or a Polyclitus, to be sure, and create a number of wonderful works; but even so, though your art will be generally commended, no sensible observer will be found to wish himself like you; whatever your real qualities, you” will always rank as a common craftsman who makes his living with his hands.

</p></div>


<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="10">
<p>'Be governed by me, on the other hand, and your first reward shall be a view of the many wondrous deeds and doings of the men of old; you shall hear their words and know them all, what manner of men they were; and your soul, which is your very self, I will adorn with many fair adornments, with self-mastery and justice and reverence and mildness, with consideration and understanding and fortitude, with love of what is beautiful, and yearning for what is great; these things it is that are the true and pure ornaments of the soul. Nought shall escape you either of ancient wisdom or of present avail; nay, the future too, with me to aid, you shall foresee; in a word, I will instil into you, and that in no long time, all knowledge human and divine.

<p>‘This penniless son of who knows whom, contemplating but now a vocation so ignoble, shall soon be admired and envied of all, with honour and praise and the fame of high achievement, respected by the high-born and the affluent, clothed as I am clothed’ (and here she pointed to her own bright

<p>‘And if some great moment come to try your friends or country, then shall all look to you. And to your lightest word the many shall listen open-mouthed, and marvel, and count you happy in your eloquence, and your father in his son. ’Tis said that some from mortal men become immortal; and I Will make it truth in you; for though you depart from life yourself, you shall; keep touch with the learned and hold communion with the best. Consider the mighty Demosthenes, whose son he was, and whither I exalted him; consider Aeschines; how came a Philip to pay court to the cymbal-woman’s brat? how but for my sake? Dame Statuary here had the breeding of Socrates himself; but no sooner could he discern the better part, than he deserted her and enlisted with me; since when, his name is on every tongue.

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="13">
<p>‘You may dismiss all these great men, and with them all glorious deeds, majestic words, and seemly looks, all honour, repute, praise, precedence, power, and office, all landed eloquence and envied wisdom; these you may put from you, to gird on a filthy apron and assume a servile guise; then will you handle crowbars and graving tools, mallets and chisels; you will be bowed over your work, with eyes and thoughts bent earthwards, abject as abject can be, with never a free and manly upward look or aspiration; all your care will be to proportion and fairly drape your works; to proportioning and adorning yourself you will give little heed enough, making yourself of less account than your marble.’

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="14">
<p>I waited not for her to bring her words to an end, but rose up and spoke my mind; I turned from that clumsy mechanic



<pb n="6"/>


woman, and went rejoicing to lady Culture, the more when I thought upon the stick, and all the blows my yesterday’s apprenticeship had brought me. For a time the deserted one was wroth, with clenched fists and grinding teeth; but at last she stiffened, like another Niobe, into marble. A strange fate, but I must request your belief; dreams are great magicians, are they not?

</p></div>


<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="15">
<p>Then the other looked upon me and spoke:—‘For this justice done me,’ said she, ‘you shall now be recompensed; come, mount this car’—and lo, one stood ready, drawn by winged steeds like Pegasus—, ‘that you may learn what fair sights another choice would have cost you.” We mounted, she took the reins and drove, and I was carried aloft and beheld towns and nations and peoples from the East to the West; and methought I was sowing like Triptolemus; but the nature of the seed I cannot call to mind—only this, that men on earth when they saw it gave praise, and all whom I reached in my flight sent me on my way with blessings.

</p></div>


<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="16">
<p>When she had presented these things to my eyes, and me to my admirers, she brought me back, no more clad as when my flight began; I returned, methought, in glorious raiment. And finding my father where he stood waiting, she showed him my raiment, and the guise in which I came, and said a word to him upon the lot which they had come so near appointing for me. All this I saw when scarce out of my childhood; the confusion and terror of the stick, it may be, stamped it on my memory.

</p></div>


<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="17">
<p>‘Good gracious,’ says some one, before I have done, ‘what a longwinded lawyer’s vision!’ ‘This,’ interrupts another,
‘must be a winter dream, to judge by the length of night required; or perhaps it took three nights, like the making of Heracles. What has come over him, that he babbles such puerilities? memorable things indeed, a child in bed, and a very

ancient, worn-out dream! what stale frigid stuff! does he take us for interpreters of dreams?’ Sir, I do not. When Xenophon related that vision of his which you all know, of his father’s house on fire and the rest, was it just by way of a riddle? was it in deliberate ineptitude that he reproduced it? a likely thing in their desperate military situation, with the enemy surrounding them! no, the relation was to serve a useful purpose.
</p></div>


<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="18">
<p>Similarly I have had an object in telling you my dream. It is that the young may be guided to the better way and set themselves to Culture, especially any among them who is recreant for fear of poverty, and minded to enter the wrong path, to the ruin of a nature not all ignoble. Such an one will be strengthened by my tale, I am well assured; in me he will find an apt example; let him only compare the boy of those days, who started in pursuit of the best and devoted himself to Culture regardless of immediate poverty, with the man who has now come back to you, as high in fame, to put it at the lowest, as any stonecutter of them all.

<head>A LITERARY PROMETHEUS</head>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="1">
<p>

So you will have me a Prometheus? If your meaning is, my good sir, that my works, like his, are of clay, I accept the comparison and hail my prototype; potter me to your heart’s content, though my clay is poor common stuff, trampled by common feet till it is little better than mud. But perhaps it is in exaggerated compliment to my ingenuity that you father my books upon the subtlest of the Titans; in that case I fear men will find a hidden meaning, and detect an Attic curl on your laudatory lips. Where do you find my ingenuity? in what consists the great subtlety, the Prometheanism, of my writings? enough for me if you have not found them sheer

earth, all unworthy of Caucasian clay-pits. How much better a claim to kinship with Prometheus have you gentlemen who win fame in the courts, engaged in real contests; your works have true life and breath, ay, and the warmth of fire. That is Promethean indeed, though with the difference, it may be, that you do not work in clay; your creations are oftenest of gold;</p></div>


<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="2">
<p> we on the other hand who come before popular audiences and offer mere lectures are exhibitors of imitations only. However, I have the general resemblance to Prometheus, as I said before—a resemblance which I share with the dollmakers—, that my modelling is in clay; but then there is no motion, as with him, not a sign of life; entertainment and pastime is the beginning and the end of my work. So I must look for light elsewhere; possibly the title is a sort of lucus a non lucendo, applied to me as to Cleon in the comedy: 

<l>Full well Prometheus-Cleon plans—the past.</l>

Or again, the Athenians used to call Prometheuses the makers of jars and stoves and other, clay-workers, with playful reference to the material, and perhaps to the use of fire in baking the ware. If that is all your ‘Prometheus’ means, you have aimed your shaft well enough, and flavoured your jest with the right Attic tartness; my productions are as brittle as their pottery; fling a stone, and you may smash them all to pieces.
</p></div>


<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="3">
<p>But here some one offers me a crumb of comfort: ‘That was not the likeness he found between you and Prometheus; he meant to commend your innovating originality: at a time when human beings did not exist, Prometheus conceived and fashioned them; he moulded and elaborated certain living things into agility and beauty; he was practically their creator, though Athene assisted by putting breath into the clay and bringing the models to life.” So says my some one, giving your remark its politest possible turn. Perhaps he has hit the true



<pb n="9"/>


meaning; not that I can rest content, however, with the mere credit of innovation, and the absence of any original to which my work can be referred; if it is not good as well as original, I assure you I shall be ashamed of it, bring down my foot and crush it out of existence; its novelty shall not avail (with me at least) to save its ugliness from annihilation. If I thought otherwise, I admit that a round dozen of vultures would be none too many for the liver of a dunce who could not see that ugliness was only aggravated by strangeness.

</p></div>


<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="4">
<p>Ptolemy, son of Lagus, imported two novelties into Egypt; one was a pure black Bactrian camel, the other a piebald man, half absolutely black and half unusually white, the two colours evenly distributed; he invited the Egyptians to the theatre, and concluded a varied show with these two, expecting to bring down the house. The audience, however, was terrified by the camel and almost stampeded; still, it was decked all over with gold, had purple housings and a richly jewelled bridle, the spoil of Darius’ or Cambyses’ treasury, if not of Cyrus’ own. As for the man, a few laughed at him, but most shrank as from a monster. Ptolemy realized that the show was a failure, and the Egyptians proof against mere novelty, preferring harmony and beauty. So he withdrew and ceased to prize them; the camel died forgotten, and the parti-coloured man became the reward of Thespis the fluteplayer for a successfal after-dinner performance.

</p></div>


<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="5">
<p>I am afraid my work is a camel in Egypt, and men’s admiration limited to the bridle and purple housings; as to combinations, though the components may be of the most beautiful
(as Comedy and Dialogue in the present case), that will not ensure a good effect, unless the mixture is harmonious and wellproportioned; it is possible that the resultant of two beauties may be bizarre. The readiest instance to hand is the centaur: not a lovely creature, you will admit, but a savage, if the 



<pb n="10"/>


paintings of its drunken bouts and murders go for anything. Well, but on the other hand is it not possible for two such components to result in beauty, as the combination of wine and honey in superlative sweetness? That is my belief; but I am not prepared to maintain that my components have that property; I fear the mixture may only have obscured their separate beauties.

</p></div>


<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="6">
<p>For one thing, there was no great original connexion or friendship between Dialogue and Comedy; the former was a stay-at-home, spending his time in solitude, or at most taking a stroll with a few intimates; whereas Comedy put herself in the hands of Dionysus, haunted the theatre, frolicked in company, laughed and mocked and tripped it to the flute when she saw good; nay, she would mount her anapaests, as likely as not, and pelt the friends of Dialogue with nicknames— doctrinaires, airy metaphysicians, and the like. The thing she loved of all else was to chaff them and drench them in holiday impertinence, exhibit them treading on air and arguing with the clouds, or measuring the jump of a flea, as a type of their ethereal refinements. But Dialogue continued his deep speculations upon Nature and Virtue, till, as the musicians say, the interval between them was two full octaves, from the highest to the lowest note. This ill-assorted pair it is that we have dared to unite and harmonize—reluctant and ill-disposed for reconciliation.

</p></div>


<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="7">
<p>And here comes in the apprehension of yet another Promethean analogy: have I confounded male and female, and incurred the penalty? Or no—when will resemblances end?— have I, rather, cheated my hearers by serving them up bones wrapped in fat, comic laughter in philosophic solemnity? As for stealing—for Prometheus is the thief’s patron too—I defy you there; that is the one fault you cannot find with me: from whom should I have stolen? if any one has dealt before

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="intro">
<p>Lucian to Nigrinus. Health.</p>

<p>There is a proverb about carrying ‘owls to Athens’—an absurd undertaking, considering the excellent supply already on the spot. Had it been my intention, in presenting Nigrinus with a volume of my composition, to indulge him of all people with a display of literary skill, I should indeed have been an arrant ‘owl-fancier in Athens.’ As however my object is merely to communicate to you my present sentiments, and the profound impression produced upon me by your eloquence, I may fairly plead Not Guilty, even to the charge of Thucydides, that ‘Men are bold from ignorance, where mature consideration would render them cautious.’ For I need not say that devotion to my subject is partly responsible for my present hardihood; it is not all the work of ignorance. Farewell.

<p></p>

<p><label>Friend</label> What a haughty and dignified Lucian returns to us from his journey! He will not vouchsafe us a glance; he stands aloof, and will hold no further communion with us. Altogether a supercilious Lucian! The change is sudden. Might one inquire the cause of this altered demeanour?</p>

<p><label>Lucian</label> ’Tis the work of Fortune.</p>

<p><label>Friend</label> Of Fortune!



<pb n="12"/></p>

<p><label>Lucian</label> As an incidental result of my journey, you see in me a happy man; ‘thrice-blest,’ as the tragedians have it.</p>

<p><label>Friend</label> Dear me. What, in this short time?</p>

<p><label>Lucian</label> Even so.</p>

<p><label>Friend</label> But what does it all mean? What is the secret of your elation? I decline to rejoice with you in this abridged fashion; I must have details. Tell me all about it.</p>

<p><label>Lucian</label> What should you think, if I told you that I had exchanged servitude for freedom; poverty for true wealth; folly and presumption for good sense?

</p></div>


<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="2">
<p><label>Friend</label> Extraordinary! But I am not quite clear of your meaning yet.</p>

<p><label>Lucian</label> Why, I went off to Rome to see an oculist—my eyes had been getting worse—</p>

<p><label>Friend</label> Yes, I know about that. I have been hoping that you would light on a good man.</p>

<p><label>Lucian</label> Well, I got up early one morning with the intention of paying a long-deferred visit to Nigrinus, the Platonic philosopher. On reaching his house, I knocked, and was duly announced and admitted to his presence. I found him with a book in his hand, surrounded by various statues of the ancient philosophers. Before him lay a tablet, with geometrical figures described on it, and a globe of reeds, designed apparently to represent the universe.</p></div>


<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="3">
<p>He greeted me cordially, and asked after my welfare. I satisfied his inquiries, and demanded, in my turn, how he did, and whether he had decided on another trip to Greece. Once on that subject, he gave free expression to his sentiments; and, I assure you, ’twas a veritable feast of ambrosia to me. The spells of the Sirens (if ever there were Sirens), of the Pindaric ‘Charmers,’ of the Homeric lotus, are things to be forgotten, after his truly divine eloquence.</p></div>


<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="4">
<p>Led on by his theme, he spoke the praises of philosophy, and of the freedom which philosophy confers; and expressed his contempt



<pb n="13"/>


for the vulgar error which sets a value upon wealth and renown and dominion and power, upon gold and purple, and all that dazzles the eyes of the world,—and once attracted my own!
I listened with rapt attention, and with a swelling heart. At the time, I knew not what had come over me; my feelings were indescribable. My dearest idols, riches and renown, lay shattered; one moment I was ready to shed bitter tears over the disillusionment, the next, I could have laughed for scorn of these very things, and was exulting in my escape from the murky atmosphere of my past life into the brightness of the upper air. The result was curious: I forgot all about my ophthalmic troubles, in the gradual improvement of my spiritual vision; for till that day I had grovelled in spiritual blindness.

</p></div>


<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="5">
<p>Little by little I came into the condition with which you were twitting me just now. Nigrinus’s words have raised in me a joyous exaltation of spirit which precludes every meaner thought. Philosophy seems to have produced the same effect on me as wine is said to have produced on the Indians the first time they drank it. The mere taste of such potent liquor threw them into a state of absolute frenzy, the intoxicating power of the wine being doubled in men so warm-blooded by nature. This is my case. I go about like one possessed; I am drunk with the words of wisdom.

</p></div>


<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="6">
<p><label>Friend</label> This is not drunkenness, but sobriety and temperance. But I should like to hear what Nigrinus actually said, if that may be. It is only right that you should take that trouble for me; I am your friend, and share your interests.</p>

<p><label>Lucian</label> Enough! You urge a willing steed. I was about to bespeak your attention. You must be my witness to the world, that there is reason in my madness. Indeed, apart from this, the work of recollection is a pleasure, and has become a constant practice with me; twice, thrice in a day I repeat over his words, though there is none to hear.</p></div>

of his mistress, remembers some word, some act of hers, dwells on it, and beguiles hours of sickness with her feigned presence. Sometimes he thinks he is face to face with her; words, heard long since, come again from her lips; he rejoices; his soul cleaves to the memory of the past, and has no time for present vexations. It is so with me. Philosophy is far away, but I have heard a philosopher’s words. I piece them together, and revolve them in my heart, and am comforted. Nigrinus is the beacon-fire on which, far out in mid-ocean, in the darkness of night, I fix my gaze; I fancy him present with me in all my doings; I hear ever the same words. At times, in moments of concentration, I see his very face, his voice rings in my ears. Of him it may truly be said, as of Pericles,

<l>In every heart he left his sting.</l></p>

<p><label>Friend</label> Stay, gentle enthusiast. Take a good breath, and start again; I am waiting to hear what Nigrinus said.</p></div>


<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="8">
<p>You beat about the bush in a manner truly exasperating.</p>

<p><label>Lucian</label> True, I must make a start, as you say. And yet... Tell me, did you never see a tragedy (nay, the comedies fare no better) murdered by bad acting, and the culprits finally hissed off the stage for their pains? As often as not the play is a perfectly good one, and has scored a success,</p>

<p><label>Friend</label> I know the sort of thing; and what about it?</p>

<p><label>Lucian</label> I am afraid that before I have done you will find that I make as sad work of it as they do,—jumbling things together pell-mell, spoiling the whole point sometimes by inadequate expression; and you will end by damning the play instead of the actor. I could put up with my own share of the disgrace; but it would vex me indeed, that my subject should be involved in my downfall; I cannot have it discredited for my shortcomings.</p></div>


<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="9">
<p>Remember, then: whatever the imperfections in my speech, the author is not to be called to account; he sits



<pb n="15"/>


far aloof from the stage, and knows nothing of what is going forward. The memory of the actor is all that you are invited to criticize; I am neither more nor less than the ‘Messenger’ in a tragedy. At each flaw in the argument, be this your first thought, that the author probably said something quite different, and much more to the point;—and then you may hiss me off if you will.

<p><label>Friend</label> Bless me; here is quite a professional exordium! You are about to add, I think, that ‘your consultation with your client has been but brief’; that you ‘come into court imperfectly instructed’; that ‘it were to be desired that your client were here to plead his own cause; as it is, you are reduced to such a meagre and inadequate statement of the case, as memory will supply” Am I right? Well then, spare yourself the trouble, as far as I am concerned. Imagine all these preliminaries settled.

<p><label>Lucian</label> I should, indeed, have been glad to avail myself of the arguments you mention, and of others too. I might have said, that mine would be no set speech, no orderly statement such as that I heard; that is wholly beyond me. Nor can I speak in the person of Nigrinus. There again I should be like a bad actor, taking the part of Agamemnon, or Creon, or Heracles’ self; he is arrayed in cloth of gold, and looks very formidable, and his mouth opens tremendously wide; and what comes out of it?
A little, shrill, womanish pipe of a voice that would disgrace Polyxena or Hecuba! I for my part have no intention of exposing myself in a mask several sizes too large for me, or of wearing a robe to which I cannot do credit. Rather than play the hero’s part, and involve him in my discomfiture, I will speak in my own person.

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="12">
<p><label>Friend</label> Will the man never have done with his masks and his stages?



<pb n="16"/></p>

<p><label>Lucian</label> Nay, that is all. And now to my subject. Nigrinus’s first words were in praise of Greece, and in particular of the Athenians. They are brought up, he said, to poverty and to philosophy. The endeavours, whether of foreigners or of their own countrymen, to introduce luxury into their midst, find no favour with them. When a man comes among them with this view, they quietly set about to correct his tendency, and by gentle degrees to bring him to a better course of life.</p></div>


<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="13">
<p>He mentioned the case of a wealthy man who arrived at Athens in all the vulgar pomp of retinue and gold and gorgeous raiment, expecting that every eye would be turned upon him in envy of his lot; instead of which, they heartily pitied the poor worm, and proceeded to take his education in hand. Not an ill-natured word, not an attempt at direct interference: it was a free city; he was at liberty to live in it as he thought fit. But when he made a public nuisance of himself in the baths or gymnasiums, crowding in with his attendants, and taking up all the room, some one would whisper, in a sly aside, as if the words were not meant to reach his ears: ‘He is afraid he will never come out from here alive; yet all is peace; there is no need of such an army.’ The remark would be overheard, and would have its educational effect. They soon eased him of his embroidery and purple, by playful allusions to flower and colour. ‘Spring is early.’ — ‘How did that peacock get here?’ — ‘His mother must have lent him that shawl,’—and so on. The same with the rest, his rings, his elaborate coiffure, and his table excesses. Little by little he came to his senses, and left Athens very much the better for the public education he had received.

</p></div>


<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="14">
<p>Nor do they scruple to confess their poverty. He mentioned a sentence which he heard pronounced unanimously by the assembled people at the Panathenaic festival. A citizen had been arrested and brought before the Steward for making his appearance in coloured clothes. The onlookers felt for him,





<pb n="17"/>


and took his part; and when the herald declared that he had violated the law by attending the festival in that attire, they all exclaimed with one voice, as if they had been in consultation,
‘that he must be pardoned for wearing those clothes, as he had no others.’

He further commended the Athenian liberty, and unpretentious style of living; the peace and learned leisure which they so abundantly enjoy. To dwell among such men, he declared, is to dwell with philosophy; a single-hearted man, who has been taught to despise wealth, may here preserve a pure morality; no life could be more in harmony with the determined pursuit of all that is truly beautiful.</p></div>


<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="15">
<p>But the man over whom gold has cast its spell, who is in love with riches, and measures happiness by purple raiment and dominion, who, living his life among flatterers and slaves, knows not the sweets of freedom, the blessings of candour, the beauty of truth; he who has given up his soul to Pleasure, and will serve no other mistress, whose heart is set on gluttony and wine and women, on whose tongue are deceit and hypocrisy; he again whose ears must be tickled with lascivious songs, and the voluptuous notes of flute and lyre;— let all such (he cried) dwell here in Rome; the life will suit them.</p></div>


<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="16">
<p>Our streets and market-places are filled with the things they love best. They may take in pleasure through every aperture, through eye and ear, nostril and palate; nor are the claims of Aphrodite forgotten. The turbid stream surges everlastingly through our streets; avarice, perjury, adultery,—all tastes are represented. Under that rush of waters, modesty, virtue, uprightness, are torn from the soul; and in their stead grows the tree of perpetual thirst, whose flowers are many strange desires.

Such was Rome; such were the blessings she taught men to enjoy.</p></div>

<p>‘As for me,’ he continued, ‘on returning from my first voyage to Greece, I stopped short a little way from the city,

<l>Ah, wretch! and leav’st thou then the light of day—the joyous freedom of Greece,</l>
<l>And wouldst behold—</l>

the turmoil of Rome? slander and insolence and gluttony, flatterers and false friends, legacy-hunters and murderers? And what wilt thou do here? thou canst not endure these things, neither canst thou escape them!</p></div>


<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="18">
<p>Thus reasoning, I withdrew myself out of range, as Zeus did Hector,

<l>Far from the scene of slaughter, blood and strife,</l>

and resolved henceforth to keep my house. I lead the life you see—a spiritless, womanish life, most men would account it— holding converse with Philosophy, with Plato, with Truth. From my high seat in this vast theatre, I look down on the scene beneath me; a scene calculated to afford much entertainment; calculated also to try a man’s resolution to the utmost.
</p></div>


<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="19">
<p>For, to give evil its due, believe me, there is no better school
for virtue, no truer test of moral strength, than life in this same city of Rome. It is no easy thing, to withstand so many temptations, so many allurements and distractions of sight and sound. There is no help for it: like Odysseus, we must sail past them all; and there must be no binding of hands, no stopping of our ears with wax; that would be but sorry courage: our ears must hear, our hands must be free,—and our contempt must be genuine.</p></div>

<p>Well may that man conceive an admiration of philosophy, who is a spectator of so much folly; well may he despise the gifts of Fortune, who views this stage, and its multitudinous actors. The slave grows to be master, the rich man is poor, the pauper becomes a prince, a king; and one is His Majesty’s friend, and another is his enemy, and a third he banishes. And here is the strangest thing of all: the affairs of mankind are



<pb n="19"/>


confessedly the playthings of Fortune, they have no pretence to security; yet, with instances of this daily before their eyes, men will reach after wealth and power;—not one of them but carries his load of hopes unrealized.

<p>‘But I said that there was entertainment also to be derived from the scene; and I will maintain it. Our rich men are an entertainment in themselves, with their purple and theis rings always in evidence, and their thousand vulgarities. The latest development is the salutation by proxy<note n="19.1">The spoken salutation being performed by a servant.</note>; they favour us with a glance, and that must be happiness enough. By the more ambitious spirits, an obeisance is expected; this is not performed at a distance, after the Persian fashion—you go right up, and make a profound bow, testifying with the angle of your body to the self-abasement of your soul; you then kiss his hand or breast—and happy and tnviable is he who may do so muchrlp And there stands the great man, protracting the illusion as leng as may be. (I heartily acquiesce, by the way, in the churlish sentence which excludes us from a nearer acquaintance with their lips.)

<p>‘But if these men a¥e amusing their courtiers and flatterers are doubly so. They rise in the small hours of the night, to go their round of the city, to have doors slammed in their faces by slaves, to swallow as best they may the compliments of “Dog,” “Toadeater,” and the like. And the guerdon of their painful circumambulations? A vulgarly magnificent dinner, the source of many woes! They eat too much, they drink more than they want, they talk more than they should; and then they go away, angry and disappointed, grumbling at their fare, and protesting against the scant courtesy shown them by their insolent patron. You may see them vomiting in every alley, squabbling at every brothel. The daylight most of them spend in bed, furnishing employment for the doctors. Most of them, I say; for with




<pb n="20"/>


some it has come to this, that they actually have no time to be ill.</p></div>


<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="23">
<p>My own opinion is that, of the two parties, the toadies are more to blame, and have only themselves to thank for their patron’s insolence. What can they expect him to think, after their commendations of his wealth, their panegyrics on money, their early attendance at his doors, their servile salutations?
If by common consent they would abstain, were it only for a few days, from this voluntary servitude, the tables must surely be turned, and the rich come to the doors of the paupers, imploring them not to leave such blessedness as theirs without a witness, their fine houses and elegant furniture lying idle for want of some one to use them. Not wealth, but the envy that waits on wealth, is the object of their desire. The truth is, gold and ivory and noble mansions are of little avail to their owner, if there is no one to admire them. If we would break the power of the rich, and bring down their pretensions, we must raise up within their borders a stronghold of Indifference.
</p></div>


<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="24">
<p>As it is, their vanity is fostered by the court that is paid to them. In ordinary men, who have no pretence to education, this conduct, no doubt, is less to be blamed. But that men who call themselves philosophers should actually outdo the rest in degradation,—this, indeed, is the climax. Imagine my feelings, when I see a brother philosopher, an old man, perhaps, mingling in the herd of sycophants; dancing attendance on some great man; adapting himself to the conversational level of a possible host! One thing, indeed, serves to distinguish him from his company, and to accentuate his disgrace;—he wears the garb of philosophy. It is much to be regretted that actors of uniform excellence in other respects will not dress conformably to their part.</p></div>


<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="25">
<p>For in the achievements of the table, what toadeater besides can be compared with them?
There is an artlessness in their manner of stuffing themselves, a frankness in their tippling, which defy competition; they

sponge with more spirit than other men, and sit on with greater persistency. It is not an uncommon thing for the more courtly sages to oblige the company with a song.’

All this he treated as a jest. But he had much to say on the subject of those paid philosophers, who hawk about virtue like any other marketable commodity. ‘Hucksters’ and ‘petty traders’ were his words for them. A man who proposes to teach the contempt of wealth, should begin (he maintained) by showing a soul above fees.</p></div>


<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="26">
<p>And certainly he has always acted on this principle himself. He is not content with giving his services gratis to all comers, but lends a helping hand to all who are in difficulties, and shows an absolute disregard for riches. So far is he from grasping at other men’s goods, that he could anticipate without concern the deterioration of his own property. He possessed an estate at no great distance from the city, on whfch for many years he had never even set foot. Nay, he disclaimed all right of property in it; meaning, I suppose, that we have no natural claim to such things; law, and the rights of inheritance, give us the use of them for an indefinite period, and for that time we are styled ‘owners’; presently our term lapses, and another succeeds to the enjoyment of a name.

There are other points in which he sets an admirable example to the serious followers of philosophy: his frugal life, his systematic habits of bodily exercise, his modest bearing, his simplicity of dress, but above all, gentle manners and a constant mind.</p></div>


<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="27">
<p>He urges his followers not to postpone the pursuit of good, as so many do, who allow themselves a period of grace till the next great festival, after which they propose to eschew deceit and lead a righteous life; there must be no shillyshallying, when virtue is the goal for which we start. On the other hand, there are philosophers whose idea of inculcating virtue in their youthful disciples is to subject them to various tests of physical endurance; whose favourite prescription is the

strait waistcoat, varied with flagellations, or the enlightened process of scarification.</p></div>


<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="28">
<p>Of these Nigrinus evidently had no opinion. According to him, our first care should be to inure the soul to pain and hardship; he who aspired to educate men aright must reckon with soul as well as body, with the age of his pupils, and with their previous training; he would then escape the palpable blunder of overtasking them. Many a one
(he affirmed) had succumbed under the unreasonable strain put upon him; and I met with an instance myself, of a man who had tasted the hardships of those schools, but no sooner heard the words of true wisdom, than he fled incontinently to Nigrinus, and was manifestly the better for the change.

</p></div>


<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="29">
<p>Leaving the philosophers to themselves, he reverted to more general subjects: the din and bustle of the city, the theatres, the race-course, the statues of charioteers, the nomenclature of horses, the horse-talk in every side-street. The rage for horses has become a positive epidemic; many persons are infected with it whom one would have credited with more sense.

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="30">
<p>Then the scene changed to the pomp and circumstance attendant upon funerals and testamentary dispositions. ‘Only once in his life’ (he observed) ‘does your thoroughbred Roman say what he means; and then,’ meaning, in his will, ‘it comes too late for him to enjoy the credit of it.’ I could not help laughing when he told me how they thought it necessary to carry their follies with them to the grave, and to leave the record of their inanity behind them in black and white; some stipulating that their clothes or other treasures should be burnt with them, others that their graves should be watched by particular servants, or their monuments crowned with flowers;—sapient end to a life of sapience!</p></div>


<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="31">
<p>‘Of their doings in this world,’ said he, ‘you may form some idea from their injunctions with reference to the next. These are they who will pay a long price for an entrée; whose floors are sprinkled with wine and saffron and



<pb n="23"/>


spices; who in midwinter smother themselves in roses, ay, for roses are scarce, and out of season, and altogether desirable; but let a thing come in its due course, and oh, ’tis vile, ’tis contemptible. These are they whose drink is of costly essences.’
He had no mercy on them here. ‘Very bunglers in sensuality, who know not her laws, and confound her ordinances, flinging down their souls to be trampled beneath the heels of luxury! As the play has it, door or window, all is one to them.</p></div>


<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="32">
<p>Such pleasures are rank solecism.’ One observation of his in the same spirit fairly caps the famous censure of Momus. Momus found fault with the divine artificer for not putting his bull’s horns in front of the eyes. Similarly, Nigrinus complained that when these men crown themselves in their banquets, they put the garlands in the wrong place; if they are so fond of the smell of violets and roses, they should tie on their garlands as close as may be under their nostrils; they could then snuff up the smell to their hearts’ content.

</p></div>


<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="33">
<p>Proceeding to the gentlemen who make such a serious work of their dinner, he was exceedingly merry over their painful elaborations of sauce and seasoning. ‘Here again,’ he cried,
‘these men are sore put to it, to procure the most fleeting of enjoyments. Grant them four inches of palate apiece—’tis the utmost we can allow any man—and I will prove to you that they have four inches of gratification for their trouble. Thus: there is no satisfaction to be got out of the costliest viands before consumption; and after it a full stomach is none the betteg for the price it has cost to fill it. Ergo, the money is paid for the pleasure snatched in transitu. But what are we to expect? These men are too grossly ignorant to discern those truer pleasures with which Philosophy rewards our resolute endeavours.’

</p></div>


<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="34">
<p>The Baths proved a fertile topic, what with the insolence of the masters and the jostlings of their men;—‘they will not



<pb n="24"/>


stand without the support of a slave; it is much that they retain enough vitality to get away on their own legs at all.’ One practice which obtains in the streets and Baths of Rome seemed to arouse his particular resentment. Slaves have to walk on ahead of their masters, and call out to them to ‘look to their feet,’ whenever there is a hole or a lump in their way; it has come to this, that men must be reminded that they are walking. ‘It is too much,’ he cried; ‘these men can get through their dinner with the help of their own teeth and fingers; they can hear with their own ears: yet they must have other men’s eyes to see for them! They are in possession of all their faculties: yet they are content to be spoken to in language which should only be addressed to poor maimed wretches! And this goes on in broad daylight, in our public places; and among the sufferers are men who are responsible for the welfare of cities!’

</p></div>


<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="35">
<p>This he said, and much more to the same effect. At length he was silent. All the time I had listened in awestruck attention, dreading the moment when he should cease. And when it was all over, my condition was like that of the Phaeacians. For a long time I gazed upon him, spellbound; then I was seized with a violent attack of giddiness; I was bathed in perspiration, and when I attempted to speak, I broke down; my voice failed, my tongue stammered, and at last I was reduced to tears. Mine was no surface wound from a random shaft. The words had sunk deep into a vital part; had come with true aim, and cleft my soul asunder. For (if I may venture to philosophize on my own account) I conceive the case thus:—
</p></div>


<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="36">
<p>A well-conditioned human soul is like a target of some soft material. As life goes on, many archers take aim thereat; and every man’s quiver is full of subtle and varied arguments, but not every man shoots aright. Some draw the bow too tight, and let fly with undue violence. These hit the true direction, but their shafts do not lodge in the mark; their impetus carries



<pb n="25"/>


them right through the soul, and they pass on their way, leaving only a gaping wound behind them. Others make the contrary mistake: their bows are too slack, and their shafts never reach their destination; as often as not their force is spent at half distance, and they drop to earth. Or if they reach the mark, they do but graze its surface; there can be no deep wound, where the archer lacks strength.</p></div>


<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="37">
<p>But a good marksman, a Nigrinus, begins with a careful examination of the mark, in case it should be particularly soft,—or again too hard; for there are marks which will take no impression from an arrow. Satisfied on this point, he dips his shaft, not in the poisons of Scythia or Crete, but in a certain ointment of his own, which is sweet in flavour and gentle in operation; then, without more ado, he lets fly. The shaft speeds with well-judged swiftness, cleaves the mark right through, and remains lodged in it; and the drug works its way through every part. Thus it is that men hear his words with mingled joy and grief; and this was my own case, while the drug was gently diffusing itself through my soul. Hence I was moved to apostrophize him in the words of Homer:

So aim; and thou shalt bring (to some) salvation.

For as it is not every man that is maddened by the sound of the Phrygian flute, but only those who are inspired of Cybele, and by those strains are recalled to their frenzy,—so too not every man who hears the words of the philosophers will go away possessed, and stricken at heart, but only those in whose nature is something akin to philosophy.

<p>Vowels of the jury.—For some time this Mr. Tau’s trespasses and encroachments on my property were of minor importance;
I made no claim for damages, and affected unconsciousness of what I heard; my conciliatory temper both you and the other letters have reason to know. His covetousness and folly, however, have now so puffed him up, that he is no longer content with my habitual concessions, but insists on more; I accordingly find myself compelled to get the matter settled by you who know both sides of it. The fact is, I am in bodily fear, owing to the crushing to which I am subjected. This evergrowing aggression will end by ousting me completely from

<p>Justice requires then that not merely you, the jury in this case, but the other letters also, should be on your guard against such attempts. If any one who chooses is to be licensed to leave his own place and usurp that of others, with no objection on your part (whose concurrence is an indispensable condition of all writing), I fail to see how combinations are to have their ancient constitutional rights secured to them. But my first reliance is upon you, who will surely never be guilty of the negligence and indifference which permits injustice; and even if you decline the contest, I have no intention of sitting down under that injustice myself.

It was while with him that I first detected Tau’s depredations. For some earlier occasional attempts (as when he took to τετταράκοντα for τεσσαράκοντα, τήμερον for

<p>But his wrongs are not even limited to us, his own species; he has now extended his operations to mankind, as I shall show. He does not permit their tongues to work straight. (But that mention of mankind calls me back for a moment, reminding me how he turns γλῶσσα into γλῶττα, half robbing me of the tongue itself. Ay, you are a disease of the tongue in every sense, Tau.) But I return from that digression, to plead the cause of mankind and its wrongs. The prisoner’s designs include the constraint, racking, and mutilation of their utterance. A man sees a beautiful thing, and wishes to describe it as καλόν, but in comes Tau, and forces the man to say ταλόν: he must have precedence everywhere, of course. Another man has something to say about a vine, and lo, before it is out, it is metamorphosed by this miserable creature into misery; he has changed κλῆμα to τλῆμα, with a suggestive hint of τλήμων. And, not content with middle-class victims, he aims at the Persian king himself, the one for whom land and sea are said to have made way and changed their nature: Cyrus comes out at his bidding as Tyrus.

Men weep, and bewail their lot, and curse Cadmus with many curses for introducing Tau into the family of letters; they say it was his body that tyrants took for a model, his shape that they imitated, when they set up the erections on which men are crucified. Σταυρός the vile engine is called, and it derives its vile name from him. Now, with all these crimes upon him, does he not deserve death, nay, many deaths? For my part I know none bad enough but that supplied by his own shape—that shape which he gave to the gibbet named σταυρός after him by men.  H.

So they gnawed his bones perfectly clean, sucked oyt with great precision any marrow there might be in them, and went off, leaving him as dry as a tree whose roots have been severed; and now they do not know him or vouchsafe him a nod—no such fools—, nor ever think of showing him charity or repaying his gifts.

Yesterday it was another story: you were imprisoned by rich men under bolts and locks and seals, and never allowed a glimpse of sunlight. That was the burden of your complaint—you were stifled in-deep darkness. We saw you pale and careworn, your fingers hooked with coin-counting, and heard how you would like to run away, if only you could get the chance.

Yes, and then how absurd it was that they should scrape and hoard, and end by being jealous of their own selves!

As for the other sort, who keep me shut up in the obscurity of strong-boxes, intent on making me heavy and fat and unwieldy, never touching me themselves, and never letting me see the light, lest some one else should catch sight of me, I always thought of them as fools and tyrants; what harm had I done that they should let me rot in close confinement? and did not they know that in a little while they would pass away and have to resign me to some other lucky man?

When I am to flit from one house to another, they lay me on parchment, seal me up carefully, make a parcel of me and take me round. The dead man lies in some dark corner, shrouded from the knees upward in an old sheet, with the cats fighting for possession of him, while those who have expectations wait for me in the public place, gaping as wide as young swallows that scream for their mother’s return.

But whoever it is, he snatches me up, parchment included, and is off with me in a flash; he used to be called Pyrrhias or Dromo or Tibius, but now he is Megacles, Megabyzus, or Protarchus; off he goes, leaving the disappointed ones staring at each other in very genuine mourning—over the fine fish which has jumped out of the landing-net after swallowing their good bait.

He ends by finding a mistress, or taking to the turf, or being cajoled by parasites; these have only to swear he is handsomer than Nireus, nobler than Cecrops or Codrus, wiser than Odysseus, richer than a dozen Croesuses rolled into one; and so the poor wretch disperses in a moment what cost so many perjuries, robberies, and swindles to amass.</p>

<p><label>Hermes</label> Well, but what do you do when he sends you?</p>

<p><label>Plutus</label> I just wander up and down till I come across some one; the first comer takes me off home with him, and thanks—whom but the God of windfalls, yourself?

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="25">
<p><label>Hermes</label> So Zeus is in error, and you do not enrich deserving pevsais according to his pleasure?</p>

So you see, as the good are few, and cities are crowded with multitudes of the bad, I am much more likely to come upon me latter in my rambles, and they keep me in their nets.</p>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="26">
<p><label>Hermes</label> Yet another question. You are not only blind (excuse my frankness), but pallid and decrepit; how comes it, then, that you have so many lovers? All men’s looks are for you; if they get possession of you, they count themselves happy men; if they miss you, life is not worth living. Why, I have known not a few so sick for love of you that they have scaled some skypointing crag, and thence hurled themselves to unplumbed ocean depths,<note n="41.1">See Apology for ‘The Dependent Scholar,’ 10.</note> when they thought they were scorned by you, because you would not acknowledge their first salute. I am sure you know yourself well enough to confess that they must be lunatics, to rave about such charms as yours.

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="27">
<p><label>Plutus</label> Why, you do not suppose they see me in my true shape, lame, blind, and so forth?</p>

<p><label>Hermes</label> How else, unless they are all as blind themselves?</p>

<p><label>Plutus</label> They are not blind, my dear boy; but the ignorant misconceptions now so prevalent obscure their vision. And then I contribute; not to be an absolute fright when they see me, I put on a charming mask, all gilt and jewels, and dress myself up. They take the mask for my face, fall in love with its beauty, and are dying to possess it. If any one were to strip and show me to them naked, they would doubtless reproach themselves for their blindness in being captivated by such an vely misshapen creature.

</p></div>


<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="28">
<p><label>Hermes</label> How about fruition, then? When they are rich, and have put the mask on themselves, they are still deluded; if any one tries to take it off, they would sooner part with their heads than with it; and it is not likely they do not know by that time that the beautyis adventitious, now that they have aninside view.</p>

<p><label>Plutus</label> There too I have powerful allies.</p>

<p><label>Hermes</label> Namely—?</p>

<p><label>Plutus</label> When a man makes my acquaintance, and opens the door to let me in, there enter unseen by my side Arrogance, Folly,

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="29">
<p><label>Hermes</label> What a smooth, slippery, unstable, evasive fellow you are, Plutus! there is no getting a firm hold of you; you wriggle through one’s fingers somehow, like an eel or a snake.

<p><label>Hermes</label> My dear sir—so unsociable?

<l>So stiff and stubborn a reply to Zeus?</l>

A misanthrope you may well be, after the way men have treated you; but with the Gods so thoughtful for you, you need not be a misotheist.

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="36">
<p><label>Timon</label> Very well, Hermes; I am extremely obliged to you and Zeus for your thoughtfulness—there; but I will not have Plutus.</p>

<p><label>Hermes</label> Why, pray?</p>

<p><label>Timon</label> He brought me countless troubles long ago—put me in the power of flatterers, set designing persons on me, stirred up ill-feeling, corrupted me with indulgence, exposed me to envy, and wound up with treacherously deserting me at a moment’s notice. Then the excellent Poverty gave mea drilling in manly labour, conversed with me in all frankness and sincerity, rewarded my exertions with a sufficiency, and taught me to despise superfluities; all hopes of a livelihood were to depend on myself, and I was to know my true “wealth, unassailable by parasites’ flattery or informers’ threats, hasty legislatures or decree-mongering legislators, and which even the tyrant’s machinations cannot touch.

</p></div>


<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="37">
<p>So, toil-hardened, working with a will at this bit of ground, my eyes rid of city offences, I get bread enough and to spare out of my spade. Go your ways, then, Hermes, and take Plutus back to Zeus. I am quite content to let every man of them go hang.





<pb n="45"/></p>

<p><label>Hermes</label> Oh, that would be a pity; they are not all hangingripe. Don’t make a passionate child of yourself, but admit Plutus. Zeus’s gifts are too good to be thrown away.</p>

<p><label>Plutus</label> Will you condescend to argue with me, Timon? or does my voice provoke you?</p>

<p><label>Timon</label> Oh, talk away; but be brief; no rascally lawyer’s ‘opening the case.’ I can put up with a few words from you, for Hermes’ sake.

</p></div>


<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="38">
<p><label>Plutus</label> A speech of some length might seem to be needed, considering the number of your charges; however, just examine your imputations of injustice. It was I that gave you those great objects of desire—consideration, precedence, honours, and every delight; all eyes and tongues and attentions were yours— my gifts; and if flatterers abused you, I am not responsible for that. It is I who should rather complain; you prostituted me vilely to scoundrels, whose laudations and cajolery of you were only samples of their designs upon me. As to your saying that I wound up by betraying you, you have things topsy-turvy again; I may complain; you took every method to estrange me, and finally kicked me out neck and crop. That is why your revered Dame Poverty has supplied you with a smockfrock to replace your soft raiment. Why, I begged and prayed Zeus (and Hermes heard me) that I might be excused from revisiting a person who had been so unfriendly to me as you.

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="39">
<p><label>Hermes</label> But you see how he is changed, Plutus; you need not be afraid to live with him now. Just go on digging, Timon; and you, Plutus, put Thesaurus in position; he will come at your call.</p>

<p><label>Timon</label> I must obey, and be a rich man again, Hermes; what can one do, when Gods insist? But reflect what troubles you are bringing on my luckless head; I have had a blissful life of late, and now for no fault of my own I am to have my hands full of gold and care again.

Next the wine disagrees with him, and at last he is carried out of the room, holding on with all his might to the flute-girl. Take him sober, for that matter, and you will hardly find his match at lying, effrontery or avarice.

For my part—and I do not ask for myself, only to divide it among my needy friends—I should be quite content with as much as my scrip would hold; it is something short of two standard bushels; if one professes philosophy, one must be moderate and have few needs—none that go beyond the capacity of a scrip.</p>

I have no patience with your long memories; this nursing of grievances, this raking up of last night’s squabbles, is unworthy of a king, let alone a king of Gods. Once take away from our feasts the little elegancies of quip and crank and wile, and what is left?. Muzziness; repletion; silence;—cheerful accompaniments these to the wine-bowl!

These things tell a sad tale, do they not, of the puny soul, the little mind, the touchy temper of the aggrieved party?.

a hideous shapeless mass, a tangle of rude vegetation. The Godshad no altars then, nor temples (for who should raise them?), no images of wood or stone, such as now abound in every corner of the earth, and are honoured with all observance. It was to me that the idea occurred—amid my ceaseless meditations on the common welfare, on the aggrandizement of the Gods and the promotion of order and beauty in the universe—of setting all to rights with a handful of clay; of creating living things, and moulding them after our own likeness. I saw what was lacking to our godhead: some counterpart, some foil wherein to set off its blessedness. And that counterpart must be mortal; but in all else exquisitely contrived, perfect in intelligence, keen to appreciate our superiority.

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="13">
<p>Thereupon, I moulded my material,


<l>With water mingling clay,</l> and created man, calling in Athene to aid me in the task. And this is my rank offence against the Gods.. Destructive work,— to reduce inanimate clay to life and motion! The Gods, it seems, are Gods no longer, now that there are mortal creatures on the earth. To judge at least by Zeus’s indignation, one would suppose that the Gods suffered some loss of prestige -from the creation of mankind; unless it is that he is afraid of another revolt, of their waging war with heaven, like the Giants.

<p>That the cause of the Gods suffered nothing at my hands is evident; show me the slightest instance to the contrary, and I will-say no more; I have but my deserts. But for the positive benefits I have conferred, use: the evidence of your eyes. The earth, no longer barren and untilled, is decked with cities and farms and the fruits of cultivation; the sea has its ships, theislands their inhabitants. Everywhere are altars and temples, everywhere festivals and sacrifices:

<l>Zeus with his presence fills their hr enherngs</l>
<l>He fills their streets.</l>

Had I created mankind for my own private convenience, it might perhaps have denoted a grasping spirit: but I made them common property; they are at the service of every God of you. Nay more: temples of Zeus, and Apollo, and Hera, temples of Hermes, are everywhere to be seen; but who ever saw a temple of Prometheus? You may judge from this, how far I have sacrificed the common cause ta my private ambition.

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="15">
<p>And further. Consider, Hermes: can any good thing whatsoever, be it gift of Nature or work of our hands, give the full measure of enjoyment to its possessor, when there is none to see, none to admire? You see whither my question tends? But for mankind, the glories of the universe must have been without a witness; and there was little satisfaction to be derived from a wealth which was doomed to excite no envy in others. We should have lacked a standard for comparison; and should never have known the extent of our happiness, while all were as happy as ourselves. The great is not great, till it is compared with the small. Yet instead of honouring me for my political insight, you crucify me; such are the wages of wisdom!

<p>Ah, but (you will say) there is so much wickedness among them; adultery, war, incest, parricide. Well, I fancy these are not unknown among ourselves? And I am sure no one would think that a reason for saying that Uranus and Ge made a mistake in creating us. Or again, you will complain that we have so much trouble in looking after them. At that rate, a shepherd ought to object to the possession of a flock, because he has to look after it. Besides, a certain show of occupation is rather gratifying than otherwise; the responsibility is not unwelcome,
—it helps to pass the time. What should we do, if we had not mankind to think of? There would be nothing to live for; we should sit about drinking nectar and gorging ourselves with ambrosia.</p></div>

assurance in finding fault with my women in particular, when all the time you are in love with them: our bulls and satyrs and swans are never tired of making descents upon the Earth; women, they find, are good enough to be made the mothers of Gods! Yes, yes (you will say), it was quite right that men should be created, but they should not have been made in our likeness. And what better model could I have taken than this, whose perfection I knew? Was I to make them brute beasts without understanding? Had they been other than they are, how should they have paid you due honour and sacrifice? When the hecatombs are getting ready, you think nothing of a journey to the ends of the earth to see the ‘blameless Ethiopians’; and my reward for procuring you these advantages is—crucifixion! But on this subject I have said enough.

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="18">
<p>And now, with your permission, I will approach the subject of that stolen fire, of which we hear so much, I have a question to ask, which I beg you will answer frankly. Has there been one spark less fire in Heaven, since men shared it with us? Of course not. It is the nature of fire, that it does not become less by being imparted to others. A fire is not put out by kindling another from it. No, this is sheer envy: you cannot bear that men should have a share of this necessary, though you have suffered no harm thereby. For shame! Gods should be beneficent, 'givers of good’; they should be above all envy. Had I taken away fire altogether, and left not a spark behind, it would have been no great loss. You have no use for it. You are never cold; you need no artificial light; nor is ambrosia improved by boiling.</p></div>

Your present complaint, you see, is sadly at variance with this taste. I wonder you do not forbid the Sun to shine on mankind. He too is of fire, and fire of a purer and diviner quality. Has anything been said to Sim about his lavish expenditure of your property?

You bad old man! Just because you have no beard, and no white hairs, are you going to pass yourself off for a child?</p>

<p><label>Eros</label> Well, and what such mighty harm has the old man ever done you, that you should talk of chains?</p>

<p><label>Zeus</label> Ask your own guilty conscience, what harm. The pranks you have played me!

<p><label>Hera</label>  Zeus! What is your opinion of this man Ixion?</p>

<p><label>Zeus</label> Why, my dear, I think he is a very good sort of man; and the best of company. Indeed, if he were unworthy of our company, he would not be here.</p>

<p><label>Hera</label>  He is unworthy! He is a villain! Discard him!</p>

<p><label>Zeus</label> Eh? What has he been after? I must know about this.</p>

<p><label>Hera</label>  Certainly you must; though I scarce know how to tell you. The wretch!</p>

<p><label>Zeus</label> Oh, oh; if he is a ‘wretch,’ you must certainly tell me all about it. I know what ‘wretch’ means, on your discreet tongue. What, he has been making love?
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="2"><p><label>Hera</label>  And to me! to me of all people! It has been going on for a long time. At first, when he would keep looking at me, I had no idea—. And then he would sigh and groan; and when I handed my cup to Ganymede after drinking, he would insist on having it, and would stop drinking to kiss it, and lift it up to his eyes; and then he would look at me again. And then of course I knew. For a long time I didn’t like to say anything to you; I thought his mad fit would pass. But when he actually dared to speak to me, I left him weeping and grovelling about, and stopped my ears, so that I might not hear his impertinences, and came to tell you. It is for you to consider what steps you will take.

When they drink of our nectar, and behold the beauties of Heaven (so different from those of Earth!), ’tis no

wonder if they fall in love, and form ambitious schemes! Yes, Love is all-powerful; and not with mortals only: we Gods have sometimes fallen beneath his sway.</p>

<p><label>Hera</label>  He has made himself master of you; no doubt of that. He does what he likes with you;—leads you by the nose. You follow him whither he chooses, and assume every shape at his command; you are his chattel, his toy. I know how it will be: you are going to let Ixion off, because you have had relations with his wife; she is the mother of Pirithous.
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="4"><p></p>

<p><label>Zeus</label> Why, what a memory you have for these little outings of mine!—Now, my idea about Ixion is this. It would never do to punish him, or to exclude him from our table; that would not look well. No; as he is so fond of you, so hard hit—even to weeping point, you tell me,—</p>

<p><label>Hera</label>  Zeus! What are you going to say?</p>

<p><label>Zeus</label> Don’t be alarmed. Let us make a cloud-phantom in your likeness, and after dinner, as he lies awake (which of course he will do, being in love), let us take it and lay it by his side. Twill put him out of his pain: he will fancy he has attained his desire.</p>

<p><label>Hera</label>  Never! The presumptuous villain!</p>

<p><label>Zeus</label> Yes, I know. But what harm can it do to you, if Ixion makes a conquest of a cloud?

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="5"><p><label>Hera</label>  But he will think that I am the cloud; he will be working his wicked will upon me for all he can tell.</p>

<p><label>Zeus</label> Now you are talking nonsense. The cloud is not Hera, and Hera is not the cloud. Ixion will be deceived; that is all.</p>

<p><label>Hera</label>  Yes, but these men are all alike—they have no delicacy.
I suppose, when he goes home, he will boast to every one of how he has enjoyed the embraces of Hera, the wife of Zeus! Why, he may tell them that I am in love with him! And they will believe it; they will know nothing about the cloud.

I am quite uneasy about it; yes, you wicked boy, your poor mother is quite uneasy: some day when Rhea is in one of her mad fits (or when she is in her senses, more likely), she will send the Corybantes after you, with orders to tear you to pieces, or throw you to the lions.

<p><label>Heracles</label> Is this druggist fellow to have a place above me, Zeus?</p>

<p><label>Asclepius</label> Of course I am; I am your better.</p>

<p><label>Heracles</label> Why, you numskull? because it was Zeus’s bolt that

cracked your skull, for your unholy doings, and now you have been allowed your immortality again out of sheer pity?</p>

<p><label>Asclepius</label> You twit me with my fiery end; you seem to have forgotten that you too were burnt to death, on Oeta.</p>

<p><label>Heracles</label> Was there no difference between your life and mine, then? I am Zeus’s son, and it is well known how I toiled, cleansing the earth, conquering monsters, and chastising men of violence. Whereas you are a root-grubber and a quack;
I dare say you have your use for doctoring sick men, but you never did a bold deed in your life.

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="2"><p><label>Asclepius</label> That comes well from you, whose burns I healed, when you came up all singed not so long ago; between the tunic and the flames, your body was half consumed. Anyhow, it would be enough to mention that I was never a slave like you, never combed wool in Lydia, masquerading in a purple shawl and being slippered by an Omphale, never killed my wife and children in a fit of the spleen.</p>

<p><label>Heracles</label> If you don’t stop being rude, I shall soon show you that immortality is not much good. I will take you up and pitch you head over heels out of Heaven, and Apollo himself shall never mend your broken crown.</p>

<p><label>Zeus</label> Cease, I say, and let us hear ourselves speak, or I will send you both away from table. Heracles, Asclepius died before you, and has the right to a better place. H.

<p><label>Hermes</label> Why so sad, Apollo?</p>

<p><label>Apollo</label> Alas, Hermes,—my love!</p>

<p><label>Hermes</label> Oh; that’s bad. What, are you still brooding over that affair of Daphne?

<p><label>Apollo</label> No. I grieve for my beloved; the Laconian, the son of Oebalus.</p>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="2"><p><label>Apollo</label> He was learning to throw the quoit, and I was throwing with him. I had just sent my quoit up into the air as usual, when jealous Zephyr (damned be he above all winds! he had long been in love with Hyacinth, though Hyacinth would have nothing to say to him)—Zephyr came blustering down from Taygetus, and dashed the quoit upon the child’s head; blood flowed from the wound in streams, and in one moment all was over. My first thought was of revenge; I lodged an arrow in Zephyr, and pursued his flight to the mountain, As for the child, I buried him at Amyclae, on the fatal spot; and from his blood I have caused a flower to spring up, sweetest, fairest of flowers, inscribed with letters of woe.—Is my grief unreasonable?</p>

<p><label>Hermes</label> Yes, it makes me angry too; how I envy him! Ah, Apollo, you may let your locks grow, and play your harp, and be proud of your looks; I am a healthy fellow, and can touch the lyre; but, when it comes to bedtime, we lie alone.</p>

<p><label>Apollo</label> Well, my loves never prosper; Daphne and Hyacinth were my great passions; she so detested me that being turned toa tree was more attractive than I; and him I killed with a quoit. Nothing is left me of them but wreaths of their leaves and flowers,</p>

But those two of yours!—that girl is wild and mannish to a degree; and now she has gone off to Scythia, and her doings there are no secret; she is as bad as any Scythian herself,—butchering strangers and eating them! Apollo, too, who pretends to be so clever, with his bow and his lyre and his medicine and his prophecies; those oracle-shops that he has opened at Delphi, and Clarus, and Dindyma, are a cheat; he takes good care to be on the safe side by giving ambiguous answers that no one can understand, and makes money out of it, for there are plenty of fools who like being imposed upon,—but sensible people know well enough that most of it is clap-trap. The prophet did not know that he was to kill his favourite with a quoit; he never foresaw that Daphne would run away from him, so handsome as he is, too, such beautiful hair!

<head><label>Hera</label>. <label>Zeus</label></head>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="1">
<p><label>Hera</label>  Well, Zeus, I should be ashamed if I had such a son; so effeminate, and so given to drinking; tying up his hair in a ribbon, indeed! and spending most of his time among mad women, himself as much a woman as any of them; dancing to flute and drum and cymbal! He resembles any one rather than his father.</p>

<p><label>Zeus</label> Anyhow, my dear, this wearer of ribbons, this woman among women, not content with conquering Lydia, subduing Thrace, and enthralling the people of Tmolus, has been on an expedition all the way to India with his womanish host, captured elephants, taken possession of the country, and led their king captive after a brief resistance. And he never stopped dancing all the time, never relinquished the thyrsus and the ivy; always drunk (as you say) and always inspired! If any scoffer presumes to make light of his ceremonial, he does not go unpunished; he is bound with vine-twigs; or his own mother mistakes him for a fawn, and tears him limb from limb. Are not these manful doings, worthy of a son of Zeus? No doubt he is fond of his comforts, too, and his amusements; we need not complain of that: you may judge from his drunken achievements, what a handful the fellow would be if he were sober.

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="2"><p></p>

<p><label>Hera</label>  I suppose you will tell me next, that the invention of wine is very much to his credit; though you see for yourself how drunken men stagger about and misbehave themselves; one would think the liquor had made them mad. Look at Icarius, the first to whom he gave the vine: beaten to death with mattocks by his own boon companions!</p>

<p><label>Zeus</label> Pooh, nonsense. That is not Dionysus’s fault, nor the wine’s fault; it comes of the immoderate use of it. Men will

drink their wine neat, and drink too much of it. Taken in moderation, it engenders cheerfulness and benevolence. Dionysus is not likely to treat any of his guests as Icarius was treated.

<p><label>Aphrodite</label> Eros, dear, you have had your victories over most of the Gods—Zeus, Posidon, Rhea, Apollo, nay, your own mother; how is it you make an exception for Athene? against her your torch has no fire, your quiver no arrows, your right hand no cunning.</p>

<p><label>Eros</label> I am afraid of her, mother; those awful flashing eyes! she is like a man, only worse. When I go against her with my arrow on the string, a toss of her plume frightens me; my hand shakes so that it drops the bow.</p>

<p><label>Aphrodite</label> I should have thought Ares was more terrible still; but you disarmed and conquered him.</p>

<p><label>Eros</label> Ah, he is only too glad to have me; he calls me to him. Athene always eyes me so! once when I flew close past her, quite by accident, with my torch, ‘If you come near me,’ she called out, ‘I swear by my father, I will run you through with my spear, or take you by the foot and drop you into Tartarus, or tear you in pieces with my own hands’—and more such dreadful things. And she has such a sour look; and then on her breast she wears that horrid face with the snaky hair; that frightens me worst of all; the nasty bogy—I run away directly I see it.

<head>The Judgment of Paris</head>





<head><label>Zeus</label>. <label>Hermes</label>. <label>Hera</label>. <label>Athene</label>. <label>Aphrodite</label>. <label>Paris</label>.</head>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="1">
<p></p>

<p><label>Zeus</label> Hermes, take this apple, and go with it to Phrygia; on the Gargaran peak of Ida you will find Priam’s son, the herdsman. Give him this message: ‘Paris, because you are handsome, and wise in the things of love, Zeus commands you to judge between the Goddesses, and say which is the most beautiful. And the prize shall be this apple.’—Now, you three, there is no time to be lost: away with you to your judge. I will have nothing to do with the matter: I love you all exactly alike, and I only wish you could all three win. If I were to give the prize to one of you, the other two would hate me, of course. In these circumstances, I am ill qualified to be your judge. But



<pb n="79"/>


this young Phrygian to whom you are going is of the royal blood
—a relation of Ganymede’s,—and at the same time a simple countryman; so that we need have no hesitation in trusting his eyes.

</p></div>


<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="2">
<p><label>Aphrodite</label> As far as I am concerned, Zeus, Momus himself might be our judge; I should not be afraid to show myself. What fault could he find with me? But the others must agree too.</p>

<p><label>Hera</label>  Oh, we are under no alarm, thank you,—though your admirer Ares should be appointed. But Paris will do; whoever Paris is.</p>

<p><label>Zeus</label> And my little Athene; have we her approval? Nay, never blush, nor hide your face. Well, well, maidens will be coy; ’tis a delicate subject. But there, she nods consent. Now, off with you; and mind, the beaten ones must not be cross with the judge; I will not have the poor lad harmed. The prize of beauty can be but one.

</p></div>


<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="3">
<p><label>Hermes</label> Now for Phrygia. I will show the way; keep close behind me, ladies, and don’t be nervous. I know Paris well: he is a charming young man; a great gallant, and an admirable judge of beauty. Depend on it, he will make a good award.</p>

<p><label>Aphrodite</label> I am glad to hear that; I ask for nothing better than, a just judge.—Has he a wife, Hermes, or is he a bachelor?</p>

<p><label>Hermes</label> Not exactly a bachelor.</p>

<p><label>Aphrodite</label> What do you mean?</p>

<p><label>Hermes</label> I believe there is a wife, as it were; a good enough sort of girl—a native of those parts—but sadly countrified! I fancy he does not care very much about her.—Why do you ask?</p>

<p><label>Aphrodite</label> I just wanted to know.

</p></div>


<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="4">
<p><label>Athene</label> Now, Hermes, that is not fair. No whispering with Aphrodite.</p>

<p><label>Hermes</label> It was nothing, Athene; nothing about you. She only asked me whether Paris was a bachelor.</p>

<p><label>Athene</label> What business is that of hers?



<pb n="80"/></p>

<p><label>Hermes</label> None that I know of. She meant nothing by the question; she just wanted to know.</p>

<p><label>Athene</label> Well, and is he?</p>

<p><label>Hermes</label> Why, no.</p>

<p><label>Athene</label> And does he care for military glory? has he ambition? or is he a mere neatherd?;</p>

<p><label>Hermes</label> I couldn’t say for certain. But he is a young man, so it is to be presumed that distinction on the field of battle is among his desires.</p>

<p><label>Aphrodite</label> There, you see; I don’t complain; I say nothing when you whisper with her. Aphrodite is not so particular as some people.</p>

<p><label>Hermes</label> Athene asked me almost exactly the same as you did; so don’t be cross. It will do you no harm, my answering a plain question.—</p></div>


<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="5">
<p>Meanwhile, we have left the stars far behind us, and are almost over Phrygia. There is Ida: I can make out the peak of Gargarum quite plainly; and if I am not mistaken, there is Paris himself.</p>

<p><label>Hera</label>  Where is he? I don’t see him.</p>

<p><label>Hermes</label> Look over there to the left, Hera: not on the top, but down the side, by that cave where you see the herd.</p>

<p><label>Hera</label>  But I don’t see the herd.</p>

<p><label>Hermes</label> What, don’t you see them coming out from between the rocks,—where I am pointing, look—and the man running down from the crag, and keeping them together with his staff?</p>

<p><label>Hera</label>  I see him now; if he it is.</p>

<p><label>Hermes</label> Oh, that is Paris. But we are getting near; it is time to alight and walk. He might be frightened, if we were to descend upon him so suddenly.</p>

<p><label>Hera</label>  Yes; very well. And now that we are on the earth, you might go on ahead, Aphrodite, and show us the way. You know the country, of course, having been here so often to see Anchises; or so I have heard.



<pb n="81"/></p>

<p><label>Aphrodite</label> Your sneers are thrown away on me, Hera.

</p></div>


<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="6">
<p><label>Hermes</label> Come; I'll lead the way myself. I spent some time on Ida, while Zeus was courting Ganymede. Many is the time that I have been sent here to keep watch over the boy; and when at last the eagle came, I flew by his side, and helped him with his lovely burden. This is the very rock, if I remember; yes, Ganymede was piping to his sheep, when down swooped the eagle behind him, and tenderly, oh, so tenderly, caught him up in those talons, and with the turban in his beak bore him off, the frightened boy straining his neck the while to see his captor.
I picked up his pipes—he had dropped them in his fright— and—ah! here is our umpire, close at hand. Let us accost him.—</p></div>


<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="7">
<p>Good-morrow, herdsman!</p>

<p><label>Paris</label> Good-morrow, youngster. And who may you be, who come thus far afield? And these dames? They are over comely, to be wandering on the mountain-side.</p>

<p><label>Hermes</label> ‘These dames,’ good Paris, are Hera, Athene, and Aphrodite; and I am Hermes, with a message from Zeus. Why so pale and tremulous? Compose yourself; there is nothing the matter. Zeus appoints you the judge of their beauty. ‘Because you are handsome, and wise in the things of love’ (so runs the message), ‘I leave the decision to you; and for the prize,—read the inscription on the apple.’

</p>
<p><label>Paris</label> Let me see what it is about. For THE FAIR, it says. But, my lord Hermes, how shall a mortal and a rustic like myself be judge of such unparalleled beauty? This is no sight for a herdsman’s eyes; let the fine city folk decide on such matters. As for me, I can tell you which of two goats is the fairer beast; or I can judge betwixt heifer and heifer;—’tis my trade.</p></div>


<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="8">
<p>But here, where all are beautiful alike, I know not how a man may leave looking at one, to look upon another. Where my eyes fall, there they fasten,—for there is beauty: I move them, and whaf do I find? more loveliness! I am fixed again,





<pb n="82"/>


yet distracted by neighbouring charms, I bathe in beauty:
I am enthralled: ah, why am I not all eyes like Argus? Methinks it were a fair award, to give the apple to all three. Then again: one is the wife and sister of Zeus; the others are his daughters. Take it where you will, ’tis a hard matter to judge.</p>

<p><label>Hermes</label> So it is, Paris. At the same time—Zeus’s orders!
There is no way out of it.

</p></div>


<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="9">
<p><label>Paris</label> Well, please point out to them, Hermes, that the losers must not be angry with me; the fault will be in my eyes only.</p>

<p><label>Hermes</label> That is quite understood. And now to work.</p>

<p><label>Paris</label> I must do what I can; there is no help for it. But first let me ask,—am I just to look at them as they are, or must I go into the matter thoroughly?</p>

<p><label>Hermes</label> That is for you to decide, in virtue of your office. You have only to give your orders; it is as you think best.</p>

<p><label>Paris</label> As I think best? Then I will be thorough.</p>

<p><label>Hermes</label> Get ready, ladies. Now, Mr. Umpire.—I will look the other way.

</p></div>


<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="10">
<p><label>Hera</label> I approve your decision, Paris. I will be the first to submit myself to your inspection. You shall see that I have more to boast of than white arms and large eyes: nought of me but is beautiful.</p>

<p><label>Paris</label> Aphrodite, will you also prepare?</p>

<p><label>Athene</label> Oh, Paris,—make her take off that girdle, first; there is magic in it; she will bewitch you. For that matter, she has no right to come thus tricked out and painted,—just like a courtesan! She ought to show herself unadorned.</p>

<p><label>Paris</label> They are right about the girdle, madam; it must go.</p>

<p><label>Aphrodite</label> Oh, very well, Athene: then take off that helmet, and show your head bare, instead of trying to intimidate the judge with that waving plume. I suppose you are afraid the colour of your eyes may be noticed, without their formidable surroundings.



<pb n="83"/></p>

<p><label>Athene</label> Oh, here is my helmet.</p>

<p><label>Aphrodite</label> And here is my girdle,</p>

<p><label>Hera</label>  Now then.

</p></div>


<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="11">
<p><label>Paris</label> God of wonders! What loveliness is here! Oh, rapture! How exquisite these maiden charms! How dazzling the majesty of Heaven’s true queen! And oh, how sweet, how enthralling is Aphrodite’s smile! 'Tis too much, too much of happiness.—But perhaps it would be well for me to view each in detail; for as yet I doubt, and know not where to look; my eyes are drawn all ways at once.</p>

<p><label>Aphrodite</label> Yes, that will be best.</p>

<p><label>Paris</label> Withdraw then, you and Athene; and let Hera remain,</p>

<p><label>Hera</label>  So be it; and when you have finished your scrutiny, you have next to consider, how you would like the present which I offer you. Paris, give me the prize of beauty, and you shall be lord of all Asia.</p>

<p><label>Paris</label> I will take no presents. Withdraw, I shall judge as I think right.</p></div>


<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="12">
<p>Approach, Athene.</p>

<p><label>Athene</label> Behold. And, Paris, if you will say that I am the fairest, I will make you a great warrior and conqueror, and you shall always win, in every one of your battles.</p>

<p><label>Paris</label> But I have nothing to do with fighting, Athene. As you see, there is peace throughout all Lydia and Phrygia, and my father’s dominion is uncontested. But never mind: I am not going to take your present, but you shall have fair play. You can robe again and put on your helmet; Thaveseen. And now for Aphrodite.

</p></div>


<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="13">
<p><label>Aphrodite</label> Here I am; take your time, and examine carefully; let nothing escape your vigilance. And I have something else to say to you, handsome Paris. Yes, you handsome boy, I have long had an eye on you; I think you must be the handsomest young fellowin all Phrygia. But it is such a pity that you don’t leave these rocks and crags, and live in a town: you will lose all

your beauty in this desert. What have you to do with mountains? What satisfaction can your beauty give to a lot of cows?
You ought to have been married long ago; not to any of these dowdy women hereabouts, but to some Greek girl; an Argive, perhaps, or a Corinthian, or a Spartan; Helen, now, is a Spartan, and such a pretty girl—quite as pretty as -I am—and so susceptible! Why, if she once caught sight of you, she would give up everything, I am sure, to go with you, and a most devoted wife she would be. But you have heard of Helen, of course?</p>

<p><label>Paris</label> No, ma’am; but I should like to hear all about her now.

</p></div>


<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="14">
<p><label>Aphrodite</label> Well, she is the daughter of Leda, the beautiful woman, you know, whom Zeus visited in the disguise of a swan.</p>

<p><label>Paris</label> And what is she like?</p>

<p><label>Aphrodite</label> She is fair, as might be expected from the swan, soft as down (she was hatched from an egg, you know), and such a lithe, graceful figure; and only think, she is so much admired, that there was a war because Theseus ran away with her; and she was a mere child then. And when she grew up, the very first men in Greece were suitors for her hand, and she was given to Menelaus, who is descended from Pelops.—Now, if you like, she shall be your wife.</p>

<p><label>Paris</label> What, when she is married already?</p>

<p><label>Aphrodite</label> Tut, child, you are a simpleton: I understand these things.</p>

<p><label>Paris</label> I should like to understand them too,</p>

Love and Desire. They shall be your guides. Love will assail her in all his might, and compel her to love you: Desire will encompass you about, and make you desirable and lovely as himself; and I will be there to help. I can get the Graces to come too, and between us we shall prevail.</p>

<p><label>Paris</label> How this will end, I know not. All I do know is, that I am in love with Helen already. I see her before me—I sail for Greece—I am in Sparta—I am on my homeward journey, with her at my side! Ah, why is none of it true?

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="16">

You have utterly done for the earth, trusting your car to a silly boy like that; he has got too near and scorched it in one place, and in another killed everything with frost by withdrawing the heat too far; there is not a single thing he has not turned upside down; if I had not seen what was happening and upset him with the thunderbolt, there would not have been a remnant of mankind left.

<p><label>Zeus</label> Oh, of course you didn’t know what a delicate business it is, and how the slightest divergence ruins everything! it never occurred to you that the horses are spirited, and want a tight hand! oh no! why, give them their heads a moment, and they are out of control; just what happened: they carried him now left, now right, now clean round backwards, and up or down, just at their own sweet will; he was utterly helpless.

I showed him how to stand, and how far he was to mount upwards, and where to begin descending, and how to hold the reins, and keep the spirited beasts under control; and I told him how dangerous it was, if he did not keep the track.. But, poor boy, when he found himself in charge of all that fire, and looking down into yawning space, he was frightened, and no wonder; and the horses soon knew I was not behind them, took the child’s measure, left the track, and wrought all this havoc; he let go the reins—I suppose he was afraid of being thrown out—and held on to the rail.

<p><label>Apollo</label> Hermes, have you any idea which of those two is Castor, and which is Pollux? I never can make out.</p>

<p><label>Hermes</label> It was Castor yesterday, and Pollux to-day.</p>

<p><label>Apollo</label> How do you tell? They are exactly alike.</p>

<p><label>Hermes</label> Why, Pollux’s face is scarred with the wounds he got in boxing; those that Amycus, the Bebrycian, gave him, when he was on that expedition with Jason, are particularly noticeable. Castor has no marks; his face is all right.</p>

<p><label>Apollo</label> Good; I am glad I know that. Everything else is the same for both. Each has his half egg-shell, with the star on top, each his javelin and his white horse.

Then again: all the other gods practise some useful profession, either here or on earth; for instance, I am a prophet, Asclepius is a doctor, you are a first-rate gymnast and trainer, Artemis ushers children into the world; now what are these two going to do? surely two such great fellows are not to have a lazy time of it?</p>

<head>I</head>

<head><label>Doris</label>. <label>Galatea</label></head>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="1">

<p><label>Doris</label> A handsome lover, Galatea, this Sicilian shepherd who they say is so mad for you!</p>

<p><label>Galatea</label> Don’t be sarcastic, Doris; he is Posidon’s son, after all.</p>

<p><label>Doris</label> Well, and if he were Zeus’s, and still such a wild shaggy creature, with only one eye (there is nothing uglier than to have only one eye), do you think his birth would improve his beauty?</p>

<p><label>Galatea</label> Shagginess and wildness, as you call them, are not ugly in a man; and his eye looks very well in the middle of his forehead, and sees just as well as if it were two.</p>

<p><label>Doris</label> Why, my dear, from your raptures about him one would think it was you that were in love, not he.

</p></div>


<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="2">
<p><label>Galatea</label> Oh no, I am not in love; but it is too bad, your all running him down as you do. It is my belief you are jealous. Do you remember? we were playing on the shore at the foot of Etna, where the long strip of beach comes between the mountain and the sea; he was feeding his sheep, and spied us from above; yes, but he never so much as glanced at the rest of you; I was the pretty one; he was all eyes—eye, I mean— for me. That is what makes you spiteful, because it showed I was better than you, good enough to be loved, while you were taken no notice of.</p>

<p><label>Doris</label> Hoity-toity! jealous indeed! because a one-eyed shepherd thinks you pretty! Why, what could he see in you but your white skin? and he only cared for that because it reminded him of cheese and milk; he thinks everything pretty that is like them. </p></div>


<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="3">
<p>If you want to know any more than that about your

looks, sit on a rock when it is calm, and lean over the water; just a bit of white skin, that is all; and who cares for that, if it is not picked out with some red?</p>

<p><label>Galatea</label> Well, if I am all white, I have got a lover of some sort; there is not a-shepherd or a sailor or a boatman to care for any of you. Besides, Polyphemus is very musical.

</p></div>


<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="4">
<p><label>Doris</label> Take care, dear; we heard him singing the other day when he serenaded you. Heavens! one would have taken him for an ass braying. And his lyre! what a thing! A stag’s skull, with its horns for the uprights; he put a bar across, and fastened on the strings without any tuning-pegs! then came the performance, all harsh and out of tune; he shouted something himself, and the lyre played something else, and the love ditty sent us into fits of laughter. Why, Echo, chatterbox that she is, would not answer him; she was ashamed to be caught mimicking such a rough ridiculous song. </p></div>


<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="5">
<p>Oh, and the pet that your beau brought you in his arms!—a bear cub nearly as shaggy as himself. Now then, Galatea, do you still think we envy you your lover?</p>

<p><label>Galatea</label> Well, Doris, only show us your own; no doubt he is much handsomer, and sings and plays far better.</p>

<p><label>Doris</label> Oh, I have not got one; I do not set up to be lovely. But one like the Cyclops—faugh, he might be one of his own goats!—he eats raw meat, they say, and feeds on travellers— one like him, dear, you may keep; I wish you nothing worse than to return his love. H.

<p><label>Cyclops</label> Only look, father, what that cursed stranger has been doing to me! He made me drunk, and set upon me whilst I was asleep, and blinded me.



<pb n="92"/></p>

<p><label>Posidon</label> Who has dared to do this?</p>

<p><label>Cyclops</label> He called himself ‘Noman’ at first: but when he had got safely out of range, he said his name was Odysseus.</p>

<p><label>Posidon</label> I know—the Ithacan; on his way back from Troy. But how did he come to dosuch a thing? He is not distinguished for courage.

</p></div>


<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="2">
<p><label>Cyclops</label> When I got back from the pasture, I caught a lot of the fellows in my cave. Evidently they had designs upon the sheep: because when I had blocked up my doorway (I have a great big stone for that), and kindled a fire, with a tree that I had brought home from the mountain,—there they were trying to hide themselves. I saw they were robbers, so I caught a few of them, and ate them of course, and then that scoundrel of a Noman, or Odysseus, whichever it is, gave me something to drink, with a drug in it; it tasted and smelt very good, but it was villanously heady stuff; it made everything spin round; even the cave seemed to be turning upside down, and I simply didn’t know where I was; and finally I fell off to sleep. And then he sharpened that stake, and made it hot in the fire, and blinded me in my sleep; and blind I have been ever since, father.
</p></div>


<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="3">
<p><label>Posidon</label> You must have slept pretty soundly, my boy, or you would have jumped up in the middle of it. Well, and how did Odysseus get off? He couldn’t move that stone away, I know.</p>

<p><label>Cyclops</label> I took that away myself, so as to catch him as he went out. I sat down in the doorway, and felt about for him with my hands. I just let the sheep go out to pasture, and told the ram everything I wanted done.
</p></div>


<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="4">
<p><label>Posidon</label> Ah! and they slipped out under the sheep? But you should have set the other Cyclopes on to him.</p>

<p><label>Cyclops</label> I did call them, and they came: but when they asked me who it was that was playing tricks with me, I said ‘Noman’; and then they thought I was mad, and went off home again.

The villain! that name of his was just a trick! And what I minded most was the way in which he made game of my misfortune: ‘Not even Papa can put this right,’ he said.</p>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="1">

<p><label>Posidon</label> What is the meaning of this, Alpheus? unlike others, when you take your plunge you do not mingle with the brine as a river should; you do not put an end to your labours by dispersing; you hold together through the sea, keep your current fresh, and hurry along in all your original purity; you dive down to strange depths like a gull or a heron; I suppose you will come to the top again and show yourself somewhere or other.</p>

<p><label>Alpheus</label> Do not press me, Posidon; a love affair; and many is the time you have been in love yourself.</p>

<p><label>Posidon</label> Woman, nymph, or Nereid?</p>

<p><label>Alpheus</label> All wrong; she is a fountain.</p>

<p><label>Posidon</label> A fountain? and where does she flow?</p>

<p><label>Posidon</label> Go, then; and may the course of love run smooth!

<p><label>Menelaus</label> I can understand your turning into water, you know, Proteus, because you are a sea-god. I can even pass the tree; and the lion is not wholly beyond the bounds of belief. But the idea of your being able to turn into fire, living under water as you do,—this excites my surprise, not to say my incredulity.</p>

<p><label>Proteus</label> Don’t let it; because I can.</p>

<p><label>Menelaus</label> I have seen you do it. But (to be frank with you)
I think there must be some deception; you play tricks with one’s eyes; you don’t really turn into anything of the kind?

</p></div>


<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="2">
<p><label>Proteus</label> Deception? What deception can there possibly be?
Everything is above-board. Your eyes were open, I suppose, and you saw me change into all these things? If that is not enough for you, if you think it is a fraud, an optical illusion, I will turn into fire again, and you can touch me with your hand, my sagacious friend. You will then be able to conclude whether I am only visible fire, or have the addseional Property of burning.</p>

<p><label>Menelaus</label> That would be rash.</p>

<p><label>Proteus</label> I suppose you have never seen such a thing as a polypus, nor observed the proceedings of that fish?</p>

<p><label>Menelaus</label> I have seen them; as to their proceedings, I shall be glad of your information.

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="3">
<p><label>Proteus</label> The polypus, having selected his rock, and attached himself by means of his suckers, assimilates himself to it, changing his colour to match that of the rock. By this means he

<p><label>Menelaus</label> So I have heard. But yours is quite another matter, Proteus.</p>

<p><label>Proteus</label> I don’t know what evidence would satisfy you, if you reject that of your own eyes.</p>

<p><label>Galene</label> No, I was not with you; Posidon had told me to keep the sea quiet for the occasion. What did Eris do, then, if she was not there?

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="2">
<p><label>Panope</label> Thetis and Peleus had just gone off to the bridal chamber, conducted by Amphitrite and Posidon, when Eris came in unnoticed—which was easy enough; some were drinking, some dancing, or attending to Apollo’s lyre or the Muses’ songs—well, she threw down a lovely apple, solid gold, my dear; and there was written on it, FOR THE FAIR. It rolled along as if it knew what it was about, till it came in front of Hera, Aphrodite, and Athene. Hermes picked it up and read out the inscription; of course we Nereids kept quiet; what should we do in such company? But they all made for it, each insisting that it was hers; and if Zeus had not parted them, there would have been a battle. He would not decide the matter himself, though they asked him to. ‘Go, all of you, to Ida,’ he said, ‘to the son of Priam; he is a man of taste, quite capable of picking out the beauty; he will be no bad judge.’</p>

<p><label>Galene</label> Yes, and the Goddesses, Panope?

<p><label>Triton</label> Oh no; she is one of the fifty daughters of that Egyptian king. Her name is Amymone; I asked about that and her family. Danaus understands discipline; he is bringing them up to do everything for themselves; they have to fetch water, and make themselves generally useful.

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="2">
<p><label>Posidon</label> And does she come all that way by herself, from Argos to Lerna?</p>

<p><label>Posidon</label> Triton, this is most exciting. We must go and see her.</p>

<p><label>Triton</label> Very well. It is just her time now; I reckon she will be about half-way to Lerna.</p>

<p><label>Posidon</label> Bring out the chariot, then. Or no; it takes such a time getting it ready, and putting the horses to. Just fetch me out a good fast dolphin; that will be quickest.</p>

<p><label>Triton</label> Here is a racer for you.</p>

<p><label>Dolphins</label> From what I can gather, Periander was very fond of him, and was always sending for him to perform; till Arion grew quite rich at his expense, and thought he would take a trip to Methymna, and show off his wealth at home. He took ship accordingly; but it was with a crew of rogues. He had made no secret of the gold and silver he had with him; and

when they were in mid Aegean, the sailors rose against him. As I was swimming alongside, I heard all that went on. ‘Since your minds are made up,’ says Arion, ‘at least let me get my mantle on, and sing my own dirge; and then I will throw myself into the sea of my own accord.’—The sailors agreed. He threw his minstrel’s cloak about him, and sang a most sweet melody; and then he let himself drop into the water, never doubting but that his last moment had come. But I caught him up on my back, and swam to shore with him at Taenarum.</p>

<p><label>Amphitrite</label> Oh no, Posidon. Let her grave be the sea which bears her name. We are so sorry for her; that step-mother’s treatment of her was shocking.</p>

<p><label>Posidon</label> No, my dear, that may not be. And indeed it is not desirable that she should lie here under the sand; her grave shall be in the Troad, as I said, or in the Chersonese. It will be no small consolation to her that Ino will have the same fate before long. She will be chased by Athamas from the top of Cithaeron down the ridge which runs into the sea, and there plunge in with her son in her arms. But her we must rescue, to please Dionysus; Ino was his nurse and suckled him, you know.

<p><label>Sea</label> What made him use his fire upon you?</p>

<p><label>Xanthus</label> Why, it was all that son of your Thetis. He was slaughtering the Phrygians; I tried entreaties, but he went raging on, damming my stream with their bodies; I was so sorry for the poor wretches, I poured down to see if I could make a flood and frighten him off them. But Hephaestus happened to be about, and he must have collected every particle of fire he had in Etna or anywhere else; on he came at me, scorched my elms and tamarisks, baked the poor fishes and eels, made me boil over, and very nearly dried me up altogether. You see what a state I am in with the burns.</p>

<p><label>Thetis</label> Oh, Doris, I have just seen a lovely girl thrown into a chest by her father, and her little baby with her; and he gave the chest to some sailors, and told them, as soon as they were far enough from the shore, to drop it into the water; he meant them to be drowned, poor things.</p>

<p><label>Doris</label> Oh, sister, but why? What was it all about? Did you hear?</p>

<p><label>Thetis</label> Her father, Acrisius, wanted to keep her from marrying. And, as she was so pretty, he shut her up in anironroom. And I don’t know whether it’s true—but they say that Zeus turned himself into gold, and came showering down through the roof, and she caught the gold in her lap,—and it was Zeus all the time. And then her father found out about it—he is a horrid, jealous old man—and he was furious, and thought she had been receiving a lover; and he put her into the chest, the moment the child was born.

I am beginning again, at the mere remembrance of it.</p>

<p><label>Doris</label> You make me cry, too. And is it all over?</p>

<p><label>Thetis</label> No; the chest has carried them safely so far; it is by Seriphus.</p>

<p><label>Triton</label> Well, ladies: so the monster you sent against the daughter of Cepheus has got killed himself, and never done Andromeda any harm at all!”</p>

<p><label>Nereid</label> Who did it? I suppose Cepheus was just using his daughter as a bait, and had a whole army waiting in ambush to kill him?</p>

<p><label>Triton</label> No, no.—Iphianassa, you remember Perseus, Danae’s boy?—they were both thrown into the sea by the boy’s grandfather, in that chest, you know, and you took pity on them.</p>

<p><label>Iphianassa</label> I know; why, I suppose he is a fine handsome young fellow by now?</p>

<p><label>Triton</label> It was he who killed your monster.</p>

<p><label>Iphianassa</label> But why? This was not the way to show his gratitude.

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="2">
<p><label>Triton</label> I'll tell you all about it. The king had sent him on this expedition against the Gorgons, and when he got to Libya—</p>

<p><label>Iphianassa</label> How did he get there? all by himself? he must have had some one to help him?—it is a dangerous journey otherwise.</p>

<p><label>Triton</label> He flew,—Athene gave him wings.—Well, so when he got to where the Gorgons were living, he caught them napping,

I suppose, cut off Medusa’s head, and flew away.</p>

<p><label>Iphianassa</label> How could he see them? The Gorgons are a forbidden sight. Whoever looks at them will never look at any one else again.</p>

<p><label>Triton</label> Athene held up her shield—I heard him telling Andromeda



<pb n="104"/>


 and Cepheus about it afterwards—Athene showed him the reflection of the Gorgon in her shield, which is as bright as any mirror; so he took hold of her hair in his left hand, grasped his scimetar with the right, still looking at the reflection, cut off her head, and was off before her sisters woke up. </p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="3">
<p>
Lowering his flight as he reached the Ethiopian coast yonder, he caught sight of Andromeda, fettered to a jutting rock, her hair hanging loose about her shoulders; ye Gods, what loveliness was there exposed to view! And first pity of her hard fate prompted him to ask the cause of her doom: but Fate had decreed the maiden’s deliverance, and presently Love stole upon him, and he resolved to save her. The hideous monster now drew near, and would have swallowed her: but the youth, hovering above, smote him with the drawn scimetar in his right hand, and with his left uncovered the petrifying Gorgon’s head: in one moment the monster was lifeless; all of him that had met that gaze was turned to stone. Then Perseus released the maiden from her fetters, and supported her, as with timid steps she descended from the slippery rock.—And now he is to marry her in Cepheus’s palace, and take her home to Argos; so that where she looked for death, she has found an uncommonly good match.</p>

<p><label>Iphianassa</label> I am not sorry to hear it. It is no fault of hers, if her mother has the vanity to set up for our rival.</p>

<p><label>Doris</label> Still, she is Andromeda’s mother; and we should have had our revenge on her through the daughter.

<p><label>West Wind</label> Such a splendid pageant I never saw on the waves, since the day I first blew. You were not there, Notus?</p>

<p><label>South Wind</label> Pageant, Zephyr? what pageant? and whose?</p>

<p><label>West Wind</label> You missed a most ravishing spectacle; such another chance you are not likely to have.</p>

<p><label>South Wind</label> I was busy with the Red Sea; and I gave the Indian coasts a little airing too. So I don’t know what you are talking about.</p>

<p><label>West Wind</label> Well, you know Agenor the Sidonian?</p>

<p><label>South Wind</label> Europa’s father? what of him?</p>

<p><label>West Wind</label> Europa it is that I am going to tell you about.</p>

<p><label>South Wind</label> You need not tell me that Zeus has been in love with her this long while; that is stale news.</p>

<p><label>West Wind</label> We can pass the love, then, and get on to the sequel.
</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="2">
<p>Europa had come down for a frolic on the beach with her playfellows. Zeus transformed himself into a bull, and joined the game. A fine sight he was—spotless white skin, crumpled horns, and gentle eyes. He gambolled on the shore with them, bellowing most musically, till Europa took heart of grace and mounted him. No sooner had she done it than, with her on his back, Zeus made off at a run for the sea, plunged in, and began swimming; she was dreadfully frightened, but kept her seat by clinging to one of his horns with her left hand, while the right held her skirt down against the puffs of wind.

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="3">

<p><label>South Wind</label> A lovely sight indeed, Zephyr, in every sense—Zeus swimming with his darling on his back.</p>

<p><label>West Wind</label> Ay, but what followed was lovelier far.

Every wave fell; the sea donned her robe of peace to speed them on their way; we winds made holiday and joined the

train, all eyes; fluttering Loves skimmed the waves, just dipping now and again a heedless toe—in their hands lighted torches, on their lips the nuptial song; up floated Nereids—few but were prodigal of naked charms—and clapped their hands, and kept pace on dolphin steeds; the Triton company, with every seacreature that frights not the eye, tripped it around the maid; for Posidon on his car, with Amphitrite by him, led them in festal mood, ushering his brother through the waves. But, crowning all, a Triton pair bore Aphrodite, reclined on a shell, heaping the bride with all flowers that blow.

<p>So went it from Phoenice even to Crete. But, when he set foot on the isle, behold, the bull was no more; ’twas Zeus that took Europa’s hand and led her to the Dictaean Cave—blushing and downward-eyed; for she knew now the end of her bringing.

But we plunged this way and that, and roused the still seas anew.</p>

<p><label>Diogenes</label> Pollux, I have a commission for you; next time you go up—and I think it is your turn for earth to-morrow—if you come across Menippus the Cynic—you will find him about the Craneum at Corinth, or in the Lyceum, laughing at the philosophers’ disputes—well, give him this message:—Menippus, Diogenes advises you, if mortal subjects for laughter begin to pall, to come down below, and find much richer material; where you are now, there is always a dash of uncertainty in it; the question will always intrude—who can be quite sure about the hereafter? Here, you can have your laugh out in security, like me; it is the best of sport to see millionaires, governors, despots, now mean and insignificant; you can only tell them by their lamentations, and the spiritless despondency which is the legacy of better days. Tell him this, and mention that he had better stuff his wallet with plenty of lupines, and any unconsidered trifles he can snap up in the way of pauper doles<note n="107.1"> In the Greek, 'a Hecate’s repast lying at a street corner.'

and ventilation, and is patched all colours of the rainbow; always laughing, and usually gibing at pretentious philosophers,</p>

<p><label>Pollux</label> Ah, I cannot mistake him now.</p>

<p><label>Diogenes</label> May I give you another message to those same philosophers?</p>

<p><label>Pollux</label> Oh, I don’t mind; go on.</p>

<p><label>Diogenes</label> Charge them generally to give up playing the fool, quarrelling over metaphysics, tricking each other with horn and crocodile puzzles,<note n="108.1">See Puzzles in Notes.</note> and teaching people to waste wit on such absurdities.</p>

<p><label>Pollux</label> Oh, but if I say anything against their wisdom, they will call me an ignorant blockhead.</p>

<p><label>Pollux</label> Very well; rely upon me.

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="3">

<p><label>Diogenes</label> And then, my most obliging of Polluxes, there is this for the rich:—O vain fools, why hoard gold? why all these pains over interest sums and the adding of hundred to hundred, when you must shortly come to us with nothing beyond the dead-penny?</p>

<p><label>Pollux</label> They shall have their message too.</p>

<p><label>Diogenes</label> Ah, and a word to the handsome and strong; Megillus of Corinth, and Damoxenus the wrestler will do. Inform them that auburn locks, eyes bright or black, rosy cheeks, are as little in fashion here as tense muscles or mighty shoulders; man and man are as like as two peas, tell them, when it comes to bare skull and no beauty.</p>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="1">

<p></p>

<p><label>Terpsion</label> Now is this fair, Pluto,—that I should die at the age of thirty, and that old Thucritus go on living past ninety?</p>

<p><label>Pluto</label> Nothing could be fairer. Thucritus lives and is in no hurry for his neighbours to die; whereas you always had some design against him; you were waiting to step into his shoes.</p>

<p><label>Terpsion</label> Well, an old man like that is past getting any enjoyment out of his money; he ought to die, and make room for younger men.</p>

<p><label>Pluto</label> This is a novel principle: the man who can no longer derive pleasure from his money is to die!—Fate and Nature have ordered it otherwise.

</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="2">

teeth in his head, half blind, tottering about with a pair of slaves on each side to hold him up, drivelling and rheumy-eyed, having no joy of life, a living tomb, the derision of his juniors,— and young men are to die in the prime of their strength and beauty. ’Tis contrary to nature. At any rate the young men have a right to know when the old are going to die, so that they may not throw away their attentions on them for nothing, as is sometimes the case. The present arrangement is a putting of the cart before the horse.:

</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="3">
<p></p>

<p><label>Pluto</label> There is a great deal more sound sense in it than you suppose, Terpsion. Besides, what right have you young fellows got to be prying after other men’s goods, and thrusting yourselves upon your childless elders? You look rather foolish, when you get buried first; it tickles people immensely; the more fervent your prayers for the death of your aged friend, the greater is the general exultation when you precede him. It has become quite a profession lately, this amorous devotion to old men and women,—childless, of course; children destroy the illusion. By the way though, some of the beloved objects see through your dirty motives well enough by now; they have children, but they pretend to hate them, and so have lovers all the same. When their wills come to be read, their faithful bodyguard is not included: nature asserts itself, the children get their rights, and the lovers realize, with gnashings of teeth, that they have been taken in.

<p><label>Terpsion</label> Too true! The luxuries that Thucritus has enjoyed at my expense! He always looked as if he were at the point of death. I never went to see him, but he would groan and squeak like a chicken barely out of the shell: I considered that he might step into his coffin at any moment, and heaped gift upon gift, for fear of being outdone in generosity by my rivals;
I passed anxious, sleepless nights, reckoning and arranging all;
’twas this, the sleeplessness and the anxiety, that brought me

As for me, I was free of Dinias’s table, and there died of a surfeit; but that is stale news; you were there, of course.</p>

<p><label>Callidemides</label> Yes, I was. Now there was an element of surprise about my fate. I suppose you know that old Ptoeodorus?</p>

<p><label>Zenophantus</label> The rich man with no children, to whom you gave most of your company?</p>

<p><label>Callidemides</label> That is the man; he had promised to leave me his heir, and I used to show my appreciation. However, it went on such a time; Tithonus was a juvenile to him; so I found a short cut to my property. I bought a potion, and agreed with the butler that next time his master called for wine (he is a pretty stiff drinker) he should have this ready in a cup and present it; and I was pledged to reward the man with his freedom.</p>

<p><label>Damasias</label> How was that?</p>

<p><label>Cnemon</label> I had been speculating on the death of Hermolaus, the millionaire. He had no children, and my attentions had been well received by him. I thought it would be a good idea to let him know that I had made my will in his favour, on the chance of its exciting his emulation.</p>

<p><label>Damasias</label> Yes; and Hermolaus?</p>

<p></p>

<p><label>Simylus</label> So here you are at last, Polystratus; you must be something very like a centenarian.</p>

<p><label>Polystratus</label> Ninety-eight.</p>

<p><label>Simylus</label> And what sort of a life have you had of it, these thirty years? you were about seventy when I died.</p>

<p><label>Polystratus</label> Delightful, though you may find it hard to believe.</p>

<p><label>Simylus</label> It ¢s surprising that you could have any joy of your life— old, weak, and childless, moreover.

</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="2">
<p></p>

<p><label>Polystratus</label> In the first place, I could do just what I liked; there were still plenty of handsome boys and dainty women; perfumes were sweet, wine kept its bouquet, Sicilian feasts were nothing to mine,</p>

<p><label>Simylus</label> This is a change, to be sure; you were very economical in my day.</p>

<p><label>Polystratus</label> Ah, but, my simple friend, these good things were presents—came in streams. From dawn my doors were thronged with visitors, and in the day it was a procession of the fairest gifts of earth.</p>

<p><label>Simylus</label> Why, you must have seized the crown after my death.</p>

<p><label>Polystratus</label> Oh no, it was only that I inspired a number of tender passions,</p>

<p><label>Simylus</label> Tender passions, indeed! what, you, an old man with hardly a tooth left in your head!</p>

<p><label>Polystratus</label> Certainly; the first of our townsmen were in love with me. Such as you see me, old, bald, blear-eyed, rheumy, they



<pb n="118"/>


delighted to do me honour; happy was the man on whom my glance rested a moment.</p>

<p><label>Simylus</label> Well, then, you had some adventure like Phaon’s, when he rowed Aphrodite across from Chios; your God granted your prayer and made you young and fair and lovely again.</p>

<p><label>Polystratus</label> No, no; I was as you see me, and I was the object of all desire.</p>

<p><label>Simylus</label> Oh, I give it up.

<p><label>Polystratus</label> Why, I should have thought you knew the violent passion for old men who have plenty of money and no children.</p>

<p><label>Simylus</label> Ah, now I comprehend your beauty, old fellow; it was the Golden Aphrodite bestowed it.</p>

<p><label>Polystratus</label> I assure you, Simylus, I had a good deal of satisfaction out of my lovers; they idolized me, almost. Often I would be coy and shut some of them out. Such rivalries! such jealous emulations!

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="4">
<p></p>

<p><label>Simylus</label> And how did you dispose of your fortune in the end?</p>

<p><label>Polystratus</label> I gave each an express promise to make him my heir; he believed, and treated me to more attentions than ever; meanwhile I had another genuine will, which was the one I left, with a message to them all to go hang.</p>

<p><label>Simylus</label> Who was the heir by this one? one of your relations, I suppose.</p>

<p><label>Polystratus</label> Not likely; it was a handsome young Phrygian I had lately bought.</p>

<p><label>Simylus</label> Age?</p>

<p><label>Polystratus</label> About twenty.</p>

<p><label>Simylus</label> Ah, I can guess his office.</p>

<p><label>Polystratus</label> Well, you know, he deserved the inheritance much better than they did; he was a barbarian and a rascal; but by this time he has the best of society at his beck. So he inherited; and now he is one of the aristocracy; his smooth chin and his

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="1">

<p></p>

<p><label>Crato</label> Did you know Moerichus of Corinth, Diogenes? A shipowner, rolling in money, with a cousin called Aristeas, nearly as rich. He had a Homeric quotation Wilt thou heave me? shall I heave thee?<note n="123.1">Homer, Il. xxiii. 724. When Ajax and Odysseus have wrestled for some time without either’s producing any impression, and the spectators are getting tired of it, the former proposes a change in tactics, '"Let us hoist—try you with me or I with you." The idea evidently is that each in turn is to offer only a passive resistance, and let his adversary try to fling him thus.’ Leaf.</note>






<pb n="124"/></p>

<p><label>Diogenes</label> What was the point of it?</p>

<p><label>Crato</label> Why, the cousins were of equal age, expected to succeed to each other’s wealth, and behaved accordingly. They published their wills, each naming the other sole heir in case of his own prior decease. So it stood in black and white, and they vied with each other in showing that deference which the relation demands. Ali the prophets, astrologers, and Chaldean dream-interpreters alike, and Apollo himself for that matter, held different views at different times about the winner; the thousands seemed to incline now to Aristeas’s side, now to Moerichus’s.

</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="2">
<p></p>

<p><label>Diogenes</label> And how did it end? I am quite curious.</p>

<p><label>Crato</label> They both died on the same day, and the properties passed to Eunomius and Thrasycles, two relations who had never had a presentiment of it. They had been crossing from Sicyon to Cirrha, when they were taken aback by a squall from the north-west, and capsized in mid-channel.

</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="3">
<p></p>

<p><label>Diogenes</label> Cleverly done. Now, when we were alive, we never had such designs on one another. I never prayed for Antisthenes’s death, with a view to inheriting his staff—though it was an extremely serviceable one, which he had cut himself from a wild olive; and I do not credit you, Crates, with ever having had an eye to my succession; it included the tub, and a wallet with two pints of lupines in it.</p>

<p><label>Crato</label> Why, no; these things were superfluities to me—and to yourself, indeed. The real necessities you inherited from Antisthenes, and I from you; and in those necessities was more grandeur and majesty than in the Persian Empire.</p>

<p><label>Diogenes</label> You allude to—.</p>

<p><label>Crato</label> Wisdom, independence, truth, frankness, freedom.




<pb n="125"/></p>

<p><label>Diogenes</label> To be sure; now I think of it, I did inherit all this from Antisthenes, and left it to you with some addition.

</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="4">
<p></p>

<p><label>Crato</label> Others, however, were not interested in such property; no one paid us the attentions of an expectant heir; they all had their eyes on gold, instead.</p>

<p><label>Diogenes</label> Of course; they had no receptacle for such things as we could give; luxury had made them so leaky—as full of holes as a worn-out purse. Put wisdom, frankness, or truth into them, and it would have dropped out; the bottom of the bag would have let them through, like the perforated cask into which those poor Danaids are always pouring. Gold, on the other hand, they could grip with tooth or nail or somehow.</p>

<p><label>Crato</label> Result: our wealth will still be ours down here; while they will arrive with no more than one penny, and even that must be left with the ferryman. H.

<p><label>Hannibal</label> Fortunately for me, Minos, I have mastered Greek since I have been here; so that my adversary will not have even that advantage of me. Now I hold that the highest praise is due to those who have won their way to greatness from obscurity; who have clothed themselves in power, and shown themselves fit for dominion. I myself entered Spain with a handful of men, took service under my brother, and was found worthy of the supreme command. I conquered the Celtiberians, subdued Western Gaul, crossed the Alps, overran the valley of the Po, sacked town after town, made myself master of the plains, approached the bulwarks of the capital, and in one day slew such a host, that their finger-rings were measured by bushels, and the rivers were bridged by their bodies. And this I did, though I had never been called a son of Ammon; I never pretended to be a god, never related visions of my mother; I made no secret of the fact that I was mere flesh and blood. My rivals were the ablest generals in the world, commanding the best soldiers in the world; I warred not with Medes or Assyrians, who fly before they are pursued, and yield the victory to him that dares take it.

And this conqueror had no sooner crushed his puny adversary by the victories of Issus and Arbela, than he forsook the traditions of his country, and lived the life of a Persian; accepting the prostrations of his subjects, assassinating his friends at his own table, or handing them over to the executioner. I in my command respected the freedom of my country, delayed not to obey her summons, when the enemy with their huge armament invaded Libya, laid aside the privileges of my office, and

submitted to my sentence withouta murmur. Yet I wasa barbarian all unskilled in Greek culture; I could not recite Homer, nor had I enjoyed the advantages of Aristotle’s instruction; I had to make a shift with such qualities as were mine by nature.—
It is on these grounds that I claim the pre-eminence. My rival has indeed all the lustre that attaches to the wearing of a diadem, and—I know not—for Macedonians such things may have charms: but I cannot think that this circumstance constitutes a higher claim than the courage and genius of one who owed nothing to Fortune, and everything to his own resolution.</p>

<p><label>Minos</label> Not bad, for a Libyan.—Well, Alexander, what do you say to that?

<p><label>Alexander</label> Silence, Minos, would be the best answer to such confident self-assertion. The tongue of Fame will suffice of itself to convince you that I was a great prince, and my opponent a petty adventurer. But I would have you consider the distance between us. Called to the throne while I was yet a boy, I quelled the disorders of my kingdom, and avenged my father’s murder. By the destruction of Thebes, I inspired the Greeks with such awe, that they appointed me their commander-inchief; and from that moment, scorning to confine myself to the kingdom that I inherited from my father, I extended my gaze over the entire face of the earth, and thought it shame if I should govern less than the whole. With a small force I invaded Asia, gained a great victory on the Granicus, took Lydia, Tonia, Phrygia,—in short, subdued all that was within my reach, before I commenced my march for Issus, where Darius was waiting for me at the head of his myriads.

I conquered Porus; I crossed the Tanais, and worsted the Scythians—no mean enemies—in a tremendous cavalry engagement. I heaped benefits upon my friends: I made my enemie’, taste my resentment.

He taunts me with selfindulgence: my illustrious friend has surely forgotten the pleasant time he spent in Capua among the ladies, while the precious moments fleeted by. Had I not scorned the Western world, and turned my attention to the East, what would it have cost me to make the bloodless conquest of Italy, and Libya, and all, as far West as Gades?

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="1">

<p><label>Diogenes</label> Dear me, Alexander, you dead like the rest of us?</p>

<p><label>Alexander</label> As you see, sir; is there anything extraordinary in a mortal’s dying?</p>

<p><label>Diogenes</label> So Ammon lied when he said you were his son; you were Philip’s after all.</p>

<p><label>Alexander</label> Apparently; if I had been Ammon’s, I should not have died.</p>

<p><label>Diogenes</label> Strange! there were tales of the same order about Olympias too. A serpent visited her, and was seen in her bed; we were given to understand that that was how you came into the world, and Philip made a mistake when he took you for his.</p>

<p><label>Alexander</label> Yes, I was told all that myself; however, I know now that my mother’s and the Ammon stories were all moonshine.</p>

<p><label>Diogenes</label> Their lies were of some practical value to you, though; your divinity brought a good many people to their knees.
</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="2">
<p>But now, whom did you leave your great empire to?</p>

<p><label>Alexander</label> Diogenes, I cannot tell you. I had no time to leave any directions about it, beyond just giving Perdiccas my ring as I died, Why are you laughing?</p>

<p><label>Diogenes</label> Oh, I was only thinking of the Greeks’ behaviour; directly you succeeded, how they flattered you! their elected patron, generalissimo against the barbarian; one of the twelve Gods according to some; temples built and sacrifices offered to the Serpent’s son!

</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="3">
<p>If I may ask, where did your Macedonians bury you?</p>

<p><label>Alexander</label> I have lain in Babylon a full month to-day; and Ptolemy of the Guards is pledged, as soon as he can get a moment’s respite from present disturbances, to take and bury me in Egypt, there to be reckoned among the Gods.





<pb n="130"/></p>

<p><label>Diogenes</label> I have some reason to laugh, you see; still nursing vain hopes of developing into an Osiris or Anubis! Pray, your Godhead, put these expectations from you; none may reascend who has once sailed the lake and penetrated our entrance;
Aeacus is watchful, and Cerberus an awkward customer.

</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="4">
<p>
But there is one thing I wish you would tell me: how do you like thinking over all the earthly bliss you left to come here—your guards and armour-bearers and lieutenant-governors, your heaps of gold and adoring peoples, Babylon and Bactria, your huge elephants, your honour and glory, those conspicuous drives with white-cinctured locks and clasped purple cloak? does the thought of them hurt? What, crying? silly fellow! did not your wise Aristotle include in his instructions any hint of the insecurity of fortune’s favours?

</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="5">
<p><label>Alexander</label> Wise? call him the craftiest of all flatterers. Allow me to know a little more than other people about Aristotle; his requests and his letters came to my address; I know how he profited by my passion for culture; how he would toady and compliment me, to be sure! now it was my beauty—that too is included under The Good; now it was my deeds and my money; for money too he called a Good—he meant that he was not going to be ashamed of taking it. Ah, Diogenes, an impostor; and a past master at it too. For me, the result of his wisdom is that I am distressed for the things you catalogued just now, as if I had lost in them the chief Goods.

<p></p>

<p><label>Philip</label> You cannot deny that you are my son this time, Alexander; you would not have died if you had been Ammon’s.</p>

<p><label>Alexander</label> I knew all the time that you, Philip, son of Amyntas, were my father. I only accepted the statement of the oracle because I thought it was good policy.</p>

<p><label>Philip</label> What, to suffer yourself to be fooled by lying priests?</p>

<p><label>Alexander</label> No, but it had an awe-inspiring effect upon the barbarians. When they thought they had a God to deal with, they gave up the struggle; which made their conquest a simple matter.

</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="2">
<p></p>

<p><label>Philip</label> And whom did you ever conquer that was worth conquering? Your adversaries were ever timid creatures, with their bows and their targets and their wicker shields. It was other work conquering the Greeks: Boeotians, Phocians, Athenians; Arcadian hoplites, Thessalian cavalry, javelin-men from Elis, peltasts of Mantinea; Thracians, Illyrians, Paeonians; to subdue these was something. But for gold-laced womanish Medes and Persians and Chaldaeans,—why, it had been done before: did you never hear of the expedition of the Ten Thousand under Clearchus? and how the enemy would not even come to blows with them, but ran away before they were within bow-shot?

</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="3">
<p></p>

<p><label>Alexander</label> Still, there were the Scythians, father, and the Indian elephants; they were no joke. And my conquests were not gained by dissension or treachery; I broke no oath, no promise, nor ever purchased victory at the expense of honour. As to the Greeks, most of them joined me without a struggle; and I dare say you have heard how I handled Thebes.</p>

<p><label>Philip</label> I know all about that; I had it from Clitus, whom you

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="4">
<p>They tell me too that you took to aping the manners of your conquered Medes; abandoned the Macedonian cloak in favour of the candys, assumed the upright tiara, and exacted oriental prostrations from Macedonian freemen! This is delicious. As to your brilliant matches, and your beloved Hephaestion, and your scholars in lions’ cages,—the less said the better. I have only heard one thing to your credit: you respected the person of Darius’s beautiful wife, and you provided for his mother and daughters; there you acted like a king.

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="5">
<p></p>

<p><label>Alexander</label> And have you nothing to say of my adventurous spirit, father, when I was the first to leap down within the ramparts of Oxydracae, and was covered with wounds?</p>

<p><label>Philip</label> Not a word. Not that it is a bad thing, in my opinion, for a king to get wounded occasionally, and to face danger at the head of his troops: but this was the last thing that you were called upon to do. You were passing for a God; and your being wounded, and carried off the field on a litter, bleeding and, groaning, could only excite the ridicule of the spectators:
Ammon stood convicted of quackery, his oracle of falsehood, his priests of flattery. The son of Zeus in a swoon, requiring medical assistance! who could help laughing at the sight?
And now that you have died, can you doubt that many a jest is being cracked on the subject of your divinity, as men contemplate the God’s corpse laid out for burial, and already going the way of all flesh? Besides, your achievements lose half their credit from this very circumstance which you say was so useful in facilitating your conquests: nothing you did could come up to your divine reputation.

<p><label>Antilochus</label> Achilles, what you were saying to Odysseus the other day about death was very poor-spirited; I should have expected better things from a pupil of Chiron and Phoenix. I was listening; you said you would rather be a servant on earth to some poor hind ‘of scanty livelihood possessed,’ than king of all the dead. Such sentiments might have been very well in the mouth of a poor-spirited cowardly Phrygian, dishonourably in love with life: for the son of Peleus, boldest of all Heroes, so to vilify himself, is a disgrace; it gives the lie to all your life; you might have had a long inglorious reign in Phthia, and your own choice was death and glory.

<p><label>Achilles</label> In those days, son of Nestor, I knew not this place; ignorant whether of those two was the better, I esteemed that flicker of fame more than life; now I see that it is worthless, let folk up there make what verses of it they will. 'Tis dead level among the dead, Antilochus; strength and beauty are no more; we welter all in the same gloom, one no better than another; the shades of Trojans fear me not, Achaeans pay me no reverence; each may say what he will; a man is a ghost, ‘or be he churl, or be he peer.’ It irks me; I would fain be a servant, and alive.

Perhaps you were one individual during your lives, the separation taking place only at your deaths, when he, the God, soared heavenwards, and you, the phantom, very properly made your appearance here?</p>

<p><label>Heracles</label> Thy ribald questions were best unanswered. Yet thus much thou shalt know.—All that was Amphitryon in Heracles, is dead; I am that mortal part. The Zeus in him lives, and is with the Gods in Heaven.

<p><label>Heracles</label> Fool! not so. We twain were one Heracles.</p>

<p><label>Diogenes</label> It’s a little difficult to grasp, the two Heracleses packed into one. I suppose you must have been like a sort of Centaur, man and God all mixed together?</p>

<p><label>Menippus</label> Yes, and you are the gate-keeper; I know all that; and I have seen the King and the Furies. But show me the men of ancient days, especially the celebrities.</p>

<p><label>Aeacus</label> This is Agamemnon; this is Achilles; near him, Idomeneus; next comes Odysseus; then Ajax, Diomede, and all the great Greeks.

<p><label>Aeacus</label> That is Cyrus; and here is Croesus; beyond him Sardanapalus, and beyond him again Midas, And yonder is Xerxes.</p>

<p><label>Menippus</label> Ha! and it was before this creature that Greece trembled? this is our yoker of Hellesponts, our designer of Athoscanals?—Croesus too! a sad spectacle! As to Sardanapalus, I will lend him a box on the ear, with your permission.</p>

<p><label>Aeacus</label> And crack his skull, poor dear! Certainly not.</p>

<p><label>Menippus</label> Then I must content myself with spitting in his ladyship’s face.

</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="3">
<p><label>Aeacus</label> Would you like to see the philosophers?</p>

<p><label>Menippus</label> I should like it of all things.</p>

<p><label>Aeacus</label> First comes Pythagoras.</p>

<p><label>Menippus</label> Good-day, Euphorbus, alias Apollo, alias what you will.</p>

<p><label>Pythagoras</label> Good-day, Menippus.</p>

<p><label>Menippus</label> What, no golden thigh nowadays?</p>

<p><label>Pythagoras</label> Why, no. I wonder if there is anything to eat in that wallet of yours?</p>

<p><label>Menippus</label> Beans, friend; you don’t like beans,</p>

<p><label>Pythagoras</label> Try me. My principles have changed with my quarters.
I find that down here our parents’ heads are in no way connected with beans.

<p><label>Menippus</label> Tell me, my brazen-slippered friend, what induced you to jump into the crater?</p>

<p><label>Empedocles</label> I did it in a fit of melancholy.</p>

<p><label>Menippus</label> Not you. Vanity, pride, folly; these were what burnt you up, slippers and all; and serve you right. All that ingenuity was thrown away, too: your death was detected.—</p>

<p><label>Aeacus</label> where is Socrates?</p>

<p><label>Aeacus</label> He is generally talking nonsense with Nestor and Palamedes.</p>

<p><label>Menippus</label> But I should like to see him, if he is anywhere about.</p>

<p><label>Aeacus</label> You see the bald one?</p>

<p><label>Menippus</label> They are all bald; that is a distinction without a difference,</p>

<p><label>Aeacus</label> The snub-nosed one.</p>

<p><label>Menippus</label> The very man I am looking for.</p>

<p><label>Socrates</label> How goes it in Athens?</p>

<p><label>Menippus</label> There are a great many young men there professing philosophy; and to judge from their dress and their walk, they should be perfect in it.</p>

<p><label>Socrates</label> I have seen many such.</p>

<p><label>Menippus</label> For that matter, I suppose you saw Aristippus arrive, reeking with scent; and Plato, the polished flatterer from Sicilian courts?</p>

<p><label>Socrates</label> And what do they think about me in Athens?</p>

<p><label>Menippus</label> Ah, you are fortunate in that respect. You pass for a most remarkable man, omniscient in fact. And all the time— if the truth must out—you know absolutely nothing.</p>

<p><label>Socrates</label> I told them that myself: but they would have it that that was my irony.

</p></div>

<p><label>Cerberus</label> Well, while he was some way off, he seemed quite unshaken; and I thought he was bent on letting the people outside realize the fact too. Then he passed into the opening and saw the gloom; I at the same time gave him a touch of the hemlock, and a pull by the leg, as he was rather slow. Then he squalled like a baby, whimpered about his children, and, oh, I don’t know what he didn’t do.

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="2">
<p><label>Menippus</label> So he was one of the theorists, was he? his indifference was a sham?</p>

<p><label>Protesilaus</label> Nay, dread lord, ’tis not life I love, but the bride that I left new wedded in my chamber that day I sailed away—ah me, to be slain by Hector as my foot touched land! My lord, that yearning gives me no peace. I return content, if she might look on me but for an hour.

<p><label>Diogenes</label> Why so proud, Carian? How are you better than the rest of us?</p>

<p><label>Mausolus</label> Sinopean, to begin with, I was a king; king of all Caria, ruler of many Lydians, subduer of islands, conqueror of well-nigh the whole of Ionia, even to the borders of Miletus. 





<pb n="146"/>




Further, I was comely, and of noble stature, and a mighty warrior. Finally, a vast tomb lies over me in Halicarnassus, of such dimensions, of such exquisite beauty as no other shade can boast. Thereon are the perfect semblances of man and horse, carved in the fairest marble; scarcely may a temple be found to match it. These are the grounds of my pride: are they inadequate?

</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="2">
<p><label>Diogenes</label> Kingship—beauty—heavy tomb; is that it?</p>

<p><label>Mausolus</label> It is as you say.</p>

<p><label>Diogenes</label> But, my handsome Mausolus, the power and the beauty are no longer there. If we were to appoint an umpire now on the question of comeliness, I see no reason why he should prefer your skull to mine. Both are bald, and bare of flesh; our teeth are equally in evidence; each of us has lost his eyes, and each is snub-nosed. Then as to the tomb and the costly marbles, I dare say such a fine erection gives the Halicarnassians something to brag about and show off to strangers: but I don’t see, friend, that you are the better for it, unless it is that you claim to carry more weight than the rest of us, with all that marble on the top of you.

While Mausolus boasts of the tomb raised to him by Artemisia, his wife and sister, Diogenes knows not whether he has a tomb or no—the question never having occurred to him; he knows only that his name is on the tongues of the wise, as one who lived the life of a man; a higher monument than yours, vile Carian slave, and set on firmer foundations, F.

<p><label>Menippus</label> And what should possess you, to be in love with Death?
He has no charm for most people.</p>

<p><label>Chiron</label> You are a sensible fellow; I will tell you. There was no further satisfaction to be had from immortality.</p>

<p><label>Menippus</label> Was it not a pleasure merely to live and see the light?</p>

<p><label>Chiron</label> No; it is variety, as I take it, and not monotony, that constitutes pleasure. Living on and on, everything always the same; sun, light, food, spring, summer, autumn, winter, one thing following another in unending sequence,—I sickened of it all. I found that enjoyment lay not in continual possession; that deprivation had its share therein.</p>

<p><label>Menippus</label> Very true, Chiron. And how have you got on since you made Hades your home?

</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="2">

<p><label>Menippus</label> Take care, Chiron! You may be caught in the snare of your own reasonings.</p>

<p><label>Chiron</label> How should that be?</p>

<p><label>Menippus</label> Why, if the monotony of the other world brought on satiety, the monotony here may do the same. You will have to look about for a further change, and I fancy there is no third life procurable.

<p></p>

<p><label>Crato</label> We were a large party, of which the most distinguished were Ismenodorus, a rich townsman of ours, Arsaces, ruler of Media, and Oroetes the Armenian. Ismenodorus had been murdered by robbers going to Eleusis over Cithaeron, I believe. He was moaning, nursing his wound, apostrophizing the young children he had left, and cursing his foolhardiness. He knew Cithaeron and the Eleutherae district were all devastated by the wars, and yet he must take only two servants with him— with five bowls and four cups of solid gold in his baggage, too.

<p>Arsaces was an old man of rather imposing aspect; he expressed his feelings in true barbaric fashion, was exceedingly angry at being expected to walk, and kept calling for his horse. In point of factit had died with him, it and he having been simultaneously transfixed by a Thracian pikeman in the fight with the Cappadocians on the Araxes, Arsaces described to us how he had

charged far in advance of his men, and the Thracian, standing his ground and sheltering himself with his buckler, warded off the lance, and then, planting his pike, transfixed man and horse together.

</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="4">
<p><label>Antisthenes</label> How could it possibly be done simultaneously?</p>

<p><label>Crato</label> Oh, quite simple, The Median was charging with his thirty-foot lance in front of him; the Thracian knocked it aside with his buckler; the point glanced by; then he knelt, received the charge on his pike, pierced the horse’s chest—the spirited beast impaling itself by its own impetus—, and finally ran Arsaces through groin and buttock. You see what happened; it was the horse’s doing rather than the man’s. However, Arsaces did not at all appreciate equality, and wanted to come down on horseback.

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="5">
<p>As for Oroetes, he was so tender-footed that he could not stand, far less walk. That is the way with all the Medes—once they are off their horses, they go delicately on tiptoe as if they were treading on thorns. He threw himself down, and there he lay; nothing would induce him to get up; so the excellent Hermes had to pick him up and carry him to the ferry; how I laughed!

<p><label>Antisthenes</label> When I came down, I did not keep with the crowd;

I inquired into the manner of their deaths, though I knew very

well. When Damis exclaimed upon his son, ‘You only have your deserts,’ I remarked,—‘an old man of ninety living in luxury yourself with your million of money, and fobbing off your eighteen-year son with a few pence! As for you, sir Acarnanian’—he was groaning and cursing Myrtium—, ‘why put the blame on Love? it belongs to yourself; you were never afraid of an enemy—took all sorts of risks in other people’s service—and then let yourself be caught, my hero, by the artificial tears and sighs of the first wench you came across.’ Blepsias uttered his own condemnation, without giving me time to do it for him: he had hoarded his money for heirs who were nothing to him, and been fool enough to reckon on immortality. I assure you it was no common satisfaction I derived from their whinings.

<p><label>Tiresias</label> The woman’s, by a long way; it was much less trouble. Women have the mastery of men; and there is no fighting for them, no manning of walls, no squabbling in the assembly, no eross-examination in the law-courts.

</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="2">
<p></p>

<p><label>Menippus</label> Well, but you have heard how Medea, in Euripides, compassionates her sex on their hard lot—on the intolerable pangs they endure in travail? And by the way—Medea’s words remind me—did you ever have a child, when you were a woman, or were you barren?</p>

<p><label>Tiresias</label> What do you mean by that question, Menippus?</p>

<p><label>Menippus</label> Oh, nothing; but I should like to know, if it is no trouble to you.</p>

<p><label>Tiresias</label> I was not barren: but I did not have a child, exactly.</p>

<p><label>Menippus</label> No; but you might have had. That’s all I wanted to know.



<pb n="153"/></p>

<p><label>Tiresias</label> Certainly.</p>

<p><label>Menippus</label> And your feminine characteristics gradually vanished, and you developed a beard, and became a man? Or did the change take place in a moment?</p>

<p><label>Tiresias</label> Whither does your question tend? One would think you doubted the fact.</p>

<p><label>Menippus</label> And what should I do but doubt such a story? AmI to take it in, like a nincompoop, without asking myself whether it is possible or not?

</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="3">
<p></p>

<p><label>Tiresias</label> At that rate, I suppose you are equally incredulous when you hear of women being turned into birds or trees or beasts,— Aëdon for instance, or Daphne, or Callisto?</p>

<p><label>Menippus</label> If I fall in with any of these ladies, I will see what they have to say about it. But to return, friend, to your own case: were you a prophet even in the days of your femininity? or did manhood and prophecy come together?</p>

<p><label>Tiresias</label> Pooh, you know nothing of the matter. I once settled a dispute among the Gods, and was blinded by Hera for my pains; whereupon Zeus consoled me with the gift of prophecy.</p>

<p><label>Menippus</label> Ah, you love a lie still, Tiresias. But there, ’tis your trade. You prophets! There is no truth in you. F.

<p></p>

<p><label>Agamemnon</label> If you went mad and wrought your own destruction, Ajax, in default of that you designed for us all, why put the blame on Odysseus? Why would you not vouchsafe him a look or a word, when he came to consult Tiresias that day? you stalked past your old comrade in arms as if he was beneath your notice.</p>

<p><label>Ajax</label> Had I not good reason? My madness lies at the door of my solitary rival for the arms.



<pb n="154"/></p>

<p><label>Agamemnon</label> Did you expect to be unopposed, and carry it over us all without a contest?</p>

<p><label>Ajax</label> Surely, in such a matter. The armour was mine by natural right, seeing I was Achilles’s cousin. The rest of you, his undoubted superiors, refused to compete, recognizing my claim. It was the son of Laertes, he that I had rescued scores of times when he would have been cut to pieces by the Phrygians, who set up for a better man and a stronger claimant than I.

</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="2">
<p></p>

<p><label>Agamemnon</label> Blame Thetis, then, my good sir; it was she who, instead of delivering the inheritance to the next of kin, brought the arms and left the ownership an open question.</p>

<p><label>Ajax</label> No, no; the guilt was in claiming them—alone, I mean.</p>

<p><label>Agamemnon</label> Surely, Ajax, a mere man may be forgiven the sin of coveting honour—that sweetest bait for which each one of us adventured; nay, and he outdid you there, if a Trojan verdict counts.</p>

<p><label>Ajax</label> Who inspired that verdict<note n="154.1">Athene is meant. The allusion is to Homer, Od. xi. 547, a passage upon the contest for the arms of Achilles, in which Odysseus states that ‘The judges were the sons of the Trojans, and Pallas Athene.’</note>? I know, but about the Gods we may not speak. Let that pass; but cease to hate Odysseus? ’tis not in my power, Agamemnon, though Athene’s self should require it of me. H.

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="1">

<p><label>Minos</label> Sostratus, the pirate here, can be dropped into Pyriphlegethon, Hermes; the temple-robber shall be clawed by the Chimera; and lay out the tyrant alongside of Tityus, there to have his liver torn by the vultures. And you honest fellows can make the best of your way to Elysium and the Isles of the Blest; this it is to lead righteous lives.




<pb n="155"/></p>

<p><label>Sostratus</label> A word with you, Minos. See if there is not some justice in my plea.</p>

<p><label>Minos</label> What, more pleadings? Have you not been convicted of villany and murder without end?</p>

<p><label>Sostratus</label> I have. Yet consider whether my sentence is just.</p>

<p><label>Minos</label> Is it just that you should have your deserts? If so, the sentence is just.</p>

<p><label>Sostratus</label> Well, answer my questions; I will not detain you long.</p>

<p><label>Minos</label> Say on, but be brief; I have other cases waiting for me.

</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="2">
<p></p>

<p><label>Sostratus</label> The deeds of my life—were they in my own choice, or were they decreed by Fate?</p>

<p><label>Minos</label> Decreed, of course.</p>

<p><label>Sostratus</label> Then all of us, whether we passed for honest men or rogues, were the instruments of Fate in all that we did?</p>

<p><label>Minos</label> Certainly; Clotho prescribes the conduct of every man at his birth.</p>

<p><label>Sostratus</label> Now suppose a man commits a murder under compulsion of a power which he cannot resist, an executioner, for instance, at the bidding of a judge, or a bodyguard at that of a tyrant. Who is the murderer, according to you?</p>

<p><label>Minos</label> The judge, of course, or the tyrant. As well ask whether the sword is guilty, which is but the tool of his anger who is prime mover in the affair.</p>

<p><label>Sostratus</label> I am indebted to you for a further illustration of my argument. Again: a slave, sent by his master, brings me gold or silver; to whom am I to be grateful? who goes down on my tablets as a benefactor?</p>

<p><label>Minos</label> The sender; the bringer is but his minister.

</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="3">
<p></p>

<p><label>Sostratus</label> Observe then your injustice! You punish us who are but the slaves of Clotho’s bidding, and reward these, who do but minister to another’s beneficence. For it will never be said that it was in our power to gainsay the irresistible ordinances of Fate?



<pb n="156"/></p>

<p><label>Minos</label> Ah, Sostratus; look closely enough, and you will find plenty of inconsistencies besides these. However, I see you are no common pirate, but a philosopher in your way; so much you have gained by your questions. Let him go, Hermes; he shall not be punished after that. But mind, Sostratus, you must not put it into other people’s heads to ask questions of this kind. F.</p></div>

<head>A Necromantic Experiment</head>

<head><label>Menippus</label>. <label>Philonides</label></head>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="1">
<p></p>

<p><label>Menippus</label> All hail, my roof, my doors, my hearth and home!
<l>How sweet again to see the light and thee!</l></p>

<p><label>Philonides</label> Menippus the cynic, surely; even so, or there are visions about. Menippus, every inch of him. What has he been getting himself up like that for? sailor’s cap, lyre, and lion-skin? However, here goes.—How are you, Menippus? where do you spring from? you have disappeared this long time.</p>

<p><label>Menippus</label> Death’s lurking-place I leave, and those dark gates

<l>Where Hades dwells, a God apart from Gods.</l></p>

<p><label>Philonides</label> Good gracious! has Menippus died, all on the quiet, and come to life for a second spell?</p>

<p><label>Menippus</label> Not so; a living guest in Hades I.</p>

<p><label>Philonides</label> But what induced you to take this queer original journey?</p>

<p><label>Menippus</label> Youth drew me on—too bold, too little wise.</p>

<p><label>Philonides</label> My good man, truce to your heroics; get off those iambic stilts, and tell me in plain prose what this get-up means; what did you want with the lower regions? It is a journey that needs a motive to make it attractive.</p>

<p><label>Menippus</label> Dear friend, to Hades’ realms I needs must go,

<l>To counsel with Tiresias of Thebes.</l>



<pb n="157"/></p>

<p><label>Philonides</label> Man, you must be mad; or why string verses instead of talking like one friend with another?</p>

<p><label>Menippus</label> My dear fellow, you need not be so surprised. I have just been in Euripides’s and Homer’s company; I suppose I am full to the throat with verse, and the numbers come as soon as I open my mouth.</p></div>


<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="2">
<p>But how are things going up here? what is Athens about?</p>

<p><label>Philonides</label> Oh, nothing new; extortion, perjury, forty per cent., face-grinding.</p>

<p><label>Menippus</label> Poor misguided fools! they are not posted up in alts latest lower-world legislation; the recent decrees against the rich will be too much for all their evasive ingenuity.</p>

<p><label>Philonides</label> Do you mean to say the lower world has been making new regulations for us?</p>

<p><label>Menippus</label> Plenty of them, I assure you. But I may not publish them, nor reveal secrets; the result might be a suit for impiety in the court of Rhadamanthus.</p>

<p><label>Philonides</label> Oh now, Menippus, in Heaven’s name, no secrets between friends! you know I am no blabber; and I am initiated, if you come to that.</p>

<p><label>Menippus</label> Tis a hard thing you ask, and a perilous; yet for you I must venture it. It was resolved, then, that these rich who roll in money and keep their gold under lock and key like a Danae——</p>

<p><label>Philonides</label> Oh, don’t come to the decrees yet; begin at the beginning. I am particularly curious about your object in going, who showed you the way, and the whole story of what you saw and heard down there; you are a man of taste, and sure not to have missed anything worth looking at or listening to.

</p></div>


<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="3">
<p><label>Menippus</label> I can refuse you nothing, you see; what is one to do, when a friend insists? Well, I will show you first the state of mind which put me on the venture. When I was a boy, and listened to Homer’s and Hesiod’s tales of war and civil strife—



<pb n="158"/>


and they do not confine themselves to the Heroes, but include the Gods in their descriptions, adulterous Gods, rapacious Gods, violent, litigious, usurping, incestuous Gods—, well, I found it all quite proper, and indeed was intensely interested in it. But as I came to man’s estate, I observed that the laws flatly contradicted the poets, forbidding adultery, sedition, and rapacity. So I was in a very hazy state of mind, and could not tell what to make of it. The Gods would surely never have been guilty of such behaviour if they had not considered it good; and yet law-givers would never have recommended avoiding it, if avoidance had not seemed desirable.

</p></div>


<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="4">
<p>In this perplexity, I determined to go to the people they call philosophers, put myself in their hands, and ask them to make what they would of me and give me a plain reliable map of life. This was my idea in going to them; but the effort only shifted me from the frying-pan into the fire; it was just among these that my inquiry brought the greatest ignorance and bewilderment to light; they very soon convinced me that the real golden life is that of the man in the street. One of them would have me do nothing but seek pleasure and ensue it; according to him, Happiness was pleasure, Another recommended the exact contrary—toil and moil, bring the body under, be filthy and squalid, disgusting and abusive—concluding always with the tags from Hesiod about Virtue, or something about indefatigable pursuit of the ideal, Another bade me despise money, and reckon the acquisition of it as a thing indifferent; he too had his contrary, who declared wealth a good in itself. I will spare you their metaphysics; I was sickened with daily doses of Ideas, Incorporeal Things, Atoms, Vacua, and a multitude more. The extraordinary thing was that people maintaining the most opposite views would each of them produce convincing plausible arguments; when the same thing was called hot and cold by different persons, there was no 



<pb n="159"/>


refuting one more than the other, however well one knew that it could not be hot and cold at once. I was just like a man dropping off to sleep, with his head first nodding forward, and then jerking back.

</p></div>


<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="5">
<p>Yet that absurdity is surpassed by another. I found by observation that the practice of these same people was diametrically opposed to their precepts. Those who preached contempt of wealth would hold on to it like grim death, dispute about interest, teach for pay, and sacrifice everything to the main chance, while the depreciators of fame directed all their words and deeds to nothing else but fame; pleasure, which had all their private devotions, they were almost unanimous in condemning.

</p></div>


<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="6">
<p>Thus again disappointed of my hope, I was in yet worse case than before; it was slight consolation to reflect that I was in numerous and wise and eminently sensible company, if I was a fool still, all astray in my quest of Truth, One night, while these thoughts kept me sleepless, I resolved to go to Babylon and ask help from one of the Magi, Zoroaster’s disciples and successors; I had been told that by incantations and other rites they could open the gates of Hades, take down any one they chose in safety, and bring him up again. I thought the best thing would be to secure the services of one of these, visit Tiresias the Boeotian, and learn from that wise seer what is the best life and the right choice for a man of sense. I got up with all speed and started straight for Babylon. When I arrived, I found a wise and wonderful Chaldean; he was white-haired, with a long imposing beard, and called Mithrobarzanes, My ptayers'and supplications at last induced him to name a price for conducting me down.

sun in a long formula, of which I never caught much; he gabbled indistinctly, like bad heralds at the Games; but he appeared to be invoking spirits. This charm completed, he spat thrice upon my face, and I went home, not letting my eyes meet those of any one we passed. Our food was nuts and acorns, our drink’ milk and hydromel and water from the Choaspes, and we slept out of doors on the grass. When he thought me sufficiently prepared, he took me at midnight to the Tigris, purified and rubbed me over, sanctified me with torches and squills and other things, muttering the charm aforesaid, then made a magic circle round me to protect me from ghosts, and finally led me home backwards just as I was; it was now time to arrange our voyage.

</p></div>


<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="8">
<p>He himself put on a magic robe, Median in character, and fetched and gave me the cap, lion’s skin, and lyre which you see, telling me if I were asked my name not to say Menippus, but Heracles, Odysseus, or Orpheus.</p>

<p><label>Philonides</label> What was that for? I see no reason either for the getup or for the choice of names,</p>

<p><label>Menippus</label> Oh, obvious enough; there is no mystery in that. He thought that as these three had gone down alive to Hades before us, I might easily elude Aeacus’s guard by borrowing their appearance, and be passed as an habitué; there is good warrant in the theatre for the efficiency of disguise.

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="9">
<p>Dawn was approaching when we went down to the river to embark; he had provided a boat, victims, hydromel, and all necessaries for our mystic enterprise. We put all aboard, and then,

<l>Troubled at heart, with welling tears, we went.</l>

For some distance we floated down stream, until we entered the marshy lake in which the Euphrates disappears. Beyond this we came toa desolate, wooded, sunless spot; there we landed, Mithrobarzanes leading the way, and proceeded to dig a pit,

slay our sheep, and sprinkle their blood round thé edge. Meanwhile the Mage, with a lighted torch in his hand, abandoning his customary whisper, shouted at the top of his voice an invocation to all spirits, particularly the Poenae and Erinyes,

<p>As he ended, theré was a great commotion, earth was burst open by the incantation, the barking of Cerberus was heard far off, and all was overcast and lowering;

<l>Quaked in his dark abyss the King of Shades;</l> for almost all was now unveiled to us, the lake, and Phlegethon, and the abode of Pluto. Undeterred, we made our way down the chasm, and came upon Rhadamanthus half dead with fear. Cerberus barked and looked like getting up; but I quickly touched my lyre, and the first note sufficed to lull him. Reaching the lake, we nearly missed our passage for that time, the ferry-boat being already full; there was incessant lamentation, and all the passengers had wounds upon them; mangled legs, mangled heads, mangled everything; no doubt there was a war going on. Nevertheless, when good Charon saw the lion’s skin, taking me for Heracles, he made room, was delighted to give me a passage, and showed us our direction when we got off.

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="11">
<p>We were now in darkness; so Mithrobarzanes led the way, and I followed holding on to him, until we reached a great meadow of asphodel, where the shades of the dead, with their thin voices, came flitting round us. Working gradually on, we reached the court of Minos; he was sitting on a high throne, with the Poenae, Avengers, and Erinyes standing at the sides. From another direction was being brought a long row of persons chained together; I heard that they were adulterers, procurers, publicans, sycophants, informers, and all the filth

that pollutes the stream of life. Separate from them came the rich and usurers, pale, pot-bellied, and gouty, each with a hundredweight of spiked collar upon him. There we stood looking at the proceedings and listening to the pleas they put in; their accusers were orators of a strange and novel species.</p>

<p><label>Philonides</label> Who, in God’s name? shrink not; let me know all.</p>

<p><label>Menippus</label> It has not escaped your observation that the sun projects certain shadows of our bodies on the ground.</p>

<p><label>Philonides</label> How should it have?</p>

<p><label>Menippus</label> These, when we die, are the prosecutors and witnesses who bring home to us our conduct on earth; their constant attendance and absolute attachment to our persons secures them high credit in the witness-box.

</p></div>


<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="12">
<p>Well, Minos carefully examined each prisoner, and sent him off to the place of the wicked to receive punishment proportionate to his transgressions, He was especially severe upon those who, puffed up with wealth and authority, were expecting an almost reverential treatment; he could not away with their ephemeral presumption and superciliousness, their failure to realize the mortality of themselves and their fortunes. Stripped of all that made them glorious, of wealth and birth and power, there they stood naked and downcast, reconstructing their worldly blessedness in their minds like a dream that is gone; the spectacle was meat and drink to me; any that I knew by sight I would come quietly up to, and remind him of his state up here; what a spirit had his been, when morning crowds lined his hall, expectant of his coming, being jostled or thrust out by lacqueys! at last my lord Sun would dawn upon them, in purple or gold or rainbow hues, not unconscious of the bliss he shed upon those who approached, if he let them kiss his breast or his hand, These reminders seemed to annoy them.

<p>Minos, however, did allow his decision to be influenced in one

case. Dionysius of Syracuse was accused by Dion of many unholy deeds, and damning evidence was produced by his shadow; he was on the point of being chained to the Chimera, when Aristippus of Cyrene, whose name and influence are great below, got him off on the ground of his constant generosity as a patron of literature.

</p></div>


<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="14">
<p>We left the court at last, and came to the place of punishment. Many a piteous sight and sound was there—cracking of whips, shrieks of the burning, rack and gibbet and wheel; Chimera tearing, Cerberus devouring; all tortured together, kings and slaves, governors and paupers, rich and beggars, and all repenting their sins. A few of them, the lately dead, we recognized. These would turn away and shrink from observation; or if they met our eyes, it would be with a slavish cringing glance—how different from the arrogance and contempt that had marked them in life! The poor were allowed half-time in their tortures, respite and punishment alternating. ‘Those with whom legend is so busy I saw with my eyes—Ixion, Sisyphus, the Phrygian Tantalus in all his misery, and the giant Tityus—how vast, his bulk covering a whole field!

</p></div>


<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="15">
<p>Leaving these, we entered the Acherusian plain, and there found the demi-gods, men and women both, and the common dead, dwelling in their nations and tribes, some of them ancient and mouldering, ‘strengthless heads,’ as Homer has it, others fresh, with substance yet in them, Egyptians chiefly, these— so long last their embalming drugs. But to know one from another was no easy task; all are so like when the bones are bared; yet with pains and long scrutiny we could make them out. They lay pell-mell in undistinguished heaps, with none of their earthly beauties left. With all those anatomies piled together as like as could be, eyes glaring ghastly and vacant, teeth gleaming bare, I knew not how to tell Thersites from Nireus the beauty, beggar Irus from the Phaeacian king, or cook

Pyrrhias from Agamemnon’s self. Their ancient marks were gone, and their bones alike—uncertain, unlabelled, indistinguishable.

</p></div>


<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="16">
<p>When I saw all this, the life of man came before me under the likeness of a great pageant, arranged and marshalled by Chance, who distributed infinitely varied costumes to the performers, She would take one and array him like a king, with tiara, bodyguard, and crown complete; another she dressed like a slave; one was adorned with beauty, another got up as a ridiculous hunchback; there must be all kinds in the show. Often before the procession was over she made individuals exchange characters; they could not be allowed to keep the same to the end; Croesus must double parts and appear as slave and captive; Maeandrius, starting as slave, would take over Polycrates’s despotism, and be allowed to keep his new clothes for a little while. And when the procession is done, every one disrobes, gives up his character with his body, and appears, as he originally was, just like his neighbour. Some, when Chance comes round collecting the properties, are silly enough to sulk and protest, as though they were being robbed of their own instead of only returning loans. You know the kind of thing on the stage—tragic actors shifting as the play requires from Creon to Priam, from Priam to Agamemnon; the same man, very likely, whom you saw just now in all the majesty of Cecrops or Erechthets, treads the boards next as a slave, because the author tells him to. The play over, each of them throws off his gold-spangled robe and his mask, descends from the buskin’s height, and moves a mean ordinary creature; his name is not now Agamemnon son of Atreus or Creon son of Menoeceus, but Polus son of Charicles of Sunium or Satyrus son of Theogiton of Marathon. Such is the condition of mankind, or so that sight presented it to me.

</p></div>


<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="17">
<p><label>Philonides</label> Now, if a man occupies a costly towering sepulchre, or



<pb n="165"/>


leaves monuments, statues, inscriptions behind him on earth, does not this place him in a class above the common dead?</p>

<p><label>Menippus</label> Nonsense, my good man; if you had looked on Mausolus himself—the Carian so famous for his tomb—, I assure you, you would never have stopped laughing; he was a miserable unconsidered unit among the general mass of the dead, flung aside in a dusty hole, with no profit of his sepulchre but its extra weight upon him. No, friend, when Aeacus gives a man his allowance of space—and it never exceeds a foot’s breadth—, he must be content to pack himself into its limits. You might have laughed still more if you had beheld the kings and governors of earth begging in Hades, selling salt fish for a living, it might be, or giving elementary lessons, insulted by any one who met them, and cuffed like the most worthless of slaves. When I saw Philip of Macedon, I could not contain myself; some one showed him to me cobbling old shoes for money in a corner. Many others were to be seen begging—people like Xerxes, Darius, or Polycrates.

</p></div>


<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="18">
<p><label>Philonides</label> These royal downfalls are extraordinary—almost incredible. But what of Socrates, Diogenes, and such wise men?</p>

<p><label>Menippus</label> Socrates still goes about proving everybody wrong, the same as ever; Palamedes, Odysseus, Nestor, and a few other conversational shades, keep him company. His legs, by the way, were still puffy and swollen from the poison. Good Diogenes pitches close to Sardanapalus, Midas, and other specimens of magnificence. The sound of their lamentations and better-day memories keeps him in laughter and spirits; he is generally stretched on his back roaring out a noisy song which drowns lamentation; it annoys them, and they are looking out for a new pitch where he may not molest them.

</p></div>


<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="19">
<p><label>Philonides</label> Tam satisfied. And now for that decree which you told me had been passed against the rich.



<pb n="166"/></p>

<p><label>Menippus</label> Well remembered; that was what I meant to tell you about, but I have somehow got far astray. Well, during my stay the presiding officers gave notice of an assembly on matters of general interest. So, when I saw every one flocking to it, I mingled with the shades and constituted myself a member. Various measures were decided upon, and last came this question of the rich. Many grave accusations were preferred against them, including violence, ostentation, pride, injustice; and at last a popular speaker rose and moved this decree.

</p>


</div>


<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="20">

<p>‘Whereas the rich are guilty of many illegalities on earth, harrying and oppressing the poor and trampling upon all their rights, it is the pleasure of the Senate and People that after death they shall ke punished in their bodies like other malefactors, but their souls shall be sent on earth to inhabit asses, until they have passed in that shape a quarter-million of years, generation after generation, bearing burdens under the tender mercies of the poor; after which they shall be permitted to die.

leave me not to wander through life in a blindness worse than yours.’ So he drew me apart to a considerable distance, and whispered in my ear:—‘The life of the ordinary man is the best and most prudent choice; cease from the folly of metaphysical speculation and inquiry into origins and ends, utterly reject their clever logic, count all these things idle talk, and pursue one end, alone—how you may do what your hand finds to do, and go your way with ever a smile and never a passion.’</p>

<p>So he, and sought the lawn of asphodel.</p>

It was now late, and I told Mithrobarzanes that our work was done, and we might reascend. ‘Very well, Menippus,’ said he, ‘I will show you an easy short cut.’ And taking me to a place where the darkness was especially thick, he pointed to a dim and distant ray of light—a mere pencil admitted through a chink. ‘There,’ he said, ‘is the shrine of Trophonius, from which the Boeotian inquirers start; go up that way, and you will be on Grecian soil without more ado.’ I was delighted, took my leave of the Mage, crawled with considerable difficulty through the aperture, and found myself, sure enough, at Lebadea.

<p><label>Hermes</label> So gay, Charon? What makes you leave your ferry to come up here? You are quite a stranger in the upper world.</p>

<p><label>Charon</label> I thought I should like to see what life is like; what men do with it, and what are these blessings of which they all lament the loss when they come down to us. Never one of them has made the passage dry-eyed. So I got leave from Pluto to take a day off, like that Thessalian lad,<note n="167.1"> See Protesilaus in Notes.</note> you know; and here I am,

in the light of day. I am in luck, it seems, to fall in with you. You will show me round, of course, and point out all that‘is to be seen, as you know all about it.</p>

<p><label>Hermes</label> I have no time, good ferryman. I am bound on certain errands of the Upper Zeus, certain human matters. He is short-tempered: any loitering on my part, and he may hand me over to you Powers of Darkness for good and all; or treat me as he did Hephaestus the other day—hurl me down headlong from the threshold of Heaven; there would be a pair of lame cupbearers then, to amuse the gods.</p>

<p><label>Charon</label> And you would leave an old messmate wandering at large on the face of the earth? ‘Think of the cruises we have sailed together, the cargoes you and I have handled! You might remember one thing, son of Maia; I have never set you down to bale or row. You lie sprawling about the deck, you great strong lubber, snoring away, or chatting the whole trip through with any communicative shade you can find; and the old man plies both oars at once. Come, stand by me, like a true son of Zeus as you are, and show me all the ins and outs, there’s a dear lad. I want to see something of life before I go back, and if you leave me in the lurch, I shall be no better off than a blind man: he comes to grief because he is always in the dark, and, contrariwise, I can make nothing of it in the light. Do me this good turn, and I’ll not forget it.</p>

<p><label>Hermes</label> Clearly this is to be a flogging matter for me.</p></div>


<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="2">
<p>There will go some shrewd knocks to the settlement of this reckoning. However, I must give you a helping hand. What is one to do, when a friend is so pressing? Now, as to going over everything thoroughly, it is out of the question; it would take us years. Meanwhile, I should have tHe hue-and-cry out after me, you would be neglecting your ghostly work, Pluto would lose the shades that you ought to be shipping over all that time, and Aeacus would never take a single toll, and would be

proportionately furious. We have only to think, therefore, of contriving you a general view of what is going on.</p>

<p><label>Charon</label> You must do the best you can for me. I know nothing of the matter, being a stranger up here.</p>

<p><label>Hermes</label> The main thing is to get an elevation from which you may see in every direction. If you could come up to Heaven, we should be saved any further trouble; you would then have a good bird’s-eye view of everything. But it would be sacrilege for one so conversant with phantoms to set foot in the courts of Zeus. Let us lose no time, therefore, in looking out a good high mountain.

</p></div>


<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="3">
<p><label>Charon</label> You know what I sometimes say to you on the ship, Hermes.—If a sudden gust strikes the sail from a new quarter, and the waves are rising high, you landsmen know not what to make of it; you are for taking in sail, or slackening the sheet, or letting her go before the wind, and then I tell you not to trouble your heads, for I know what to do. Well, now it is your turn; you are sailing this ship; do as you think best, and I'll sit quiet, as a passenger should, and obey orders.</p>

<p><label>Hermes</label> Just so; leave it to me, and I will find a good look-out. How would Caucasus do? Or is Parnassus higher? Olympus, perhaps, is higher than either of them. Olympus! stay, that reminds me; I have a happy thought. But there is work for two here; I shall want your assistance.</p>

<p><label>Charon</label> Give your orders. I’ll bear a hand, to the best of my ability.</p>

<p><label>Hermes</label> Homer tells us how the sons of Aloeus<note n="169.1">See Ofus in Neies.</note> (they were but two, like ourselves) took it into their heads, when they were yet children, to drag up Ossa from its foundations, and plant it on the top of Olympus, and then Pelion on the top of all; they thought that would serve as a ladder for getting into heaven. The two boys were rightly punished for their presumption.







<pb n="170"/>




But we have no design against the Gods: why should not we take the hint, and make an erection of mountains piled one on the top of another? From such a height we should get a better view.

</p></div>


<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="4">
<p><label>Charon</label> What, shall we two be able to lift Pelion or Ossa?</p>

<p><label>Hermes</label> Why not? We are gods; I should hope we are as good as those two infants.</p>

<p><label>Charon</label> Yes; but I should never have thought we could do such a job as that.</p>

<p><label>Hermes</label> Ah, my dear Charon, you don’t understand these things; you have no imagination. To the lofty spirit of Homer this is simplicity itself. Just a couple of lines, and the mountains are in place;—we have only to walk up. I wonder you make such a marvel of this. You know Atlas, of course?
He holds up the entire heaven by himself, Gods and all. And I dare say you have heard how my brother Heracles relieved him once, and took the burden on his own shoulders for a time?;</p>

<p><label>Charon</label> Yes, I have heard it. But you and the poets best know whether it is true.</p>

<p><label>Hermes</label> Oh, perfectly true. What should induce wise men to lie?—Come, let us get to work on Ossa first; for so the masterbuilder directs:

<l>Ossa first;</l>
<l>On Ossa leafy Pelion.</l>

There! What think you of this? Is it suave work? is it poetry?</p></div>


<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="5">
<p>I must run up, and see whether we shall want another storey. Oh dear, we are no way up as yet. On the East, it is all I can do to make out Ionia and Lydia; on the West is nothing but Italy and Sicily; on the North, nothing to be seen beyond the Danube; and on the South, Crete, none too clear. It looks to me as if we should want Oeta, my nautical friend; and Parnassus into the bargain



<pb n="171"/></p>

<p><label>Charon</label> So be it; but take care not to make the height too great for the width; or down we shall come, ladder and all, and pay our footing in the Homeric school of architecture with a cracked crown apiece.</p>

<p><label>Hermes</label> No fear; all will be safe enough. Pass Oeta along. Now trundle Parnassus up. There; I'll go up again. ...
That’s better! A fine view. You can come now.</p>

<p><label>Charon</label> Give me a hand up, Hermes. This is an erection, and no mistake!</p>

<p><label>Hermes</label> Well, you know, you would see everything. Safety is one thing, my friend, and sight-seeing is another. Here is my hand; hang on, and keep clear of the slippery bits. There, now you are up. Let us sit down; here are two peaks, one for each of us. Now take a general look round at the prospect.

</p></div>


<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="6">
<p><label>Charon</label> I see a vast stretch of land, and a huge lake surrounding it, and mountains, and rivers bigger than Cocytus and Pyriphlegethon; and men, tiny little things! and I suppose their dens.</p>

<p><label>Hermes</label> Dens? Those are cities!</p>

<p><label>Charon</label> I tell you what it is, Hermes; all this isnouse. Here have we been shifting about Parnassus (Castalia and all complete), and Oeta, and these others, and we might have spared ouiselves the trouble!</p>

<p><label>Hermes</label> How so?</p>

<p><label>Charon</label> Why, I can make nothing out up here. These cities and mountains look for all the world like a map. It is men that I am after; I want to see what they do, and hear what they say. That is what I was laughing about just now, when first you met me, and asked me what the joke was. I had heard something that tickled me hugely.</p>

<p><label>Hermes</label> And what might that be?</p>

<p><label>Charon</label> One of them had been asked by a friend to dinner, I think it was, the next day. ‘Depend on it,’ says he, ‘I'll be

with you.’ And before the words were out of his mouth, down came a tile—started somehow from the roof—and he was a dead man! Ha, ha, thought I, that promise will never be kept.—
So I think I shall go down again; I want to see and hear.

</p></div>


<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="7">
<p><label>Hermes</label> Sit where you are. I will soon put that right; you shall see with the best; Homer has a charm for this too. Now, the moment I say the lines, there must be no more dull eyes; all must be clear as daylight. Don’t forget!</p>

<p><label>Charon</label> Say on.</p>

<p><label>Hermes</label> <l>See, from before thine eyes I lift the veil;</l>
<l>So shalt thou clearly know both God and man.</l>

Well? Are the eyes any better?</p>

<p><label>Charon</label> A marvellous improvement! Lynceus-is blind to me. Now, the next thing I want is information. I have some questions to ask. Will you have them couched in the Homeric style, to convince you that I am not wholly unversed in his poems?</p>

<p><label>Hermes</label> And how should you know anything of Homer? A seaman, chained to the oar!</p>

<p><label>Charon</label> Come, come; no abuse of my profession. The fact is, when he died, and I ferried him over, I heard a good many of his ballads, and a few of them still run in my head, There was a pretty stiff gale on at the time, too. You see, he began singing a song about Posidon, which boded no good to us mariners,
—how Posidon gathered the clouds, and stirred the depths with his trident, as with a ladle, and roused the whirlwind, and a good deal more (enough to raise a storm of itself),— when suddenly there came a black squall which nearly capsized the boat. The poet was extremely ill, and disgorged such an avalanche of minstrelsy (Scylla, Charybdis, the Cyclops, all came up bodily), that I had no difficulty in preserving a few snatches.
</p></div>


<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="8">
<p>I should like to know, for instance,



<pb n="173"/>




<l>Who is yon hero, stout and strong and tall,</l>
<l>O’ertopping all mankind by head and shoulders?</l></p>

<p><label>Hermes</label> That is Milo of Croton, the athlete. He has just picked up a bull, and is carrying it along the race-course; and the Greeks are applauding him.</p>

<p><label>Charon</label> It would be more to the point, if they were to offer their congratulations to me. I shall presently be picking up Milo himself, and putting him into my boat; that will be after he has had his fall from Death, that most invincible of antagonists, who will have him on his back before he knows what is happening. We shall hear a sad tale then, no doubt, of the crowns and the applause he has left behind him. Meanwhile, he is mightily elated over the bull exploit, and the distinction it has won him. What is one to think? Does it ever occur to him that he must die some day?</p>

<p><label>Hermes</label> How should he think of death? He is at his zenith.</p>

<p><label>Charon</label> Well, never mind him. We shall have sport enough with him before long; he will come aboard with no strength left to pick up a gnat, let alone a bull.</p></div>


<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="9">
<p>But pray,
<l>Who is yon haughty hero?</l>
No Greek, to judge by his dress.</p>

<p><label>Hermes</label> That is Cyrus, son of Cambyses, who transferred to the Persians the ancient empire of the Medes. He has lately conquered Assyria, and reduced Babylon; and now it looks as if he meditated an invasion of Lydia, to complete his dominion by the overthrow of Croesus.</p>

<p><label>Charon</label> And whereabouts is Croesus?</p>

<p><label>Hermes</label> Look over there. You see the great city with the triple wall? That is Sardis, And there, look, is Croesus himself, reclining on a golden couch, and conversing with Solon the Athenian. Shall we listen to what they are saying?</p>

<p><label>Charon</label> Yes, let us.</p>

<p><label>Hermes</label></p></div>


<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="10">
<p>Stranger, you have now seen my stores of treasure, my heaps



<pb n="174"/>


of bullion, and all my riches. Tell me therefore, whom do you account the happiest of mankind?</p>

<p><label>Charon</label> What will Solon say, I wonder?</p>

<p><label>Hermes</label> Trust Solon; he will not disgrace himself. So, Croesus, few men are happy. Of those whom I know, the happiest, I think, were Cleobis and Biton, the sons of the Argive priestess.</p>

<p><label>Charon</label> Ah, he means those two who yoked themselves to a waggon, and drew their mother to the temple, and died the moment after. It was but the other day.</p>

<p><label>Croesus</label> Ah. So they are first on the list. And who comes next?</p>

<p><label>Solon</label> Tellus the Athenian, who lived a righteous life, and died for bis country.</p>

<p><label>Croesus</label> And where do I come, reptile?</p>

<p><label>Solon</label> That I am unable to say at present, Croesus; I must see you end your days first. Death is the sure test;—a happy end to a life of happiness.</p>

<p><label>Charon</label> Bravo, Solon; you have not forgotten us! As you say, Charon’s ferry is the proper place for the decision of these questions.—</p></div>


<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="11">
<p>But who are these men whom Croesus is sending out? And what have they got on their shoulders?</p>

<p><label>Hermes</label> Those are bars of gold; they are going to Delphi, to pay for an oracle, which oracle will presently be the ruin of Croesus. But oracles are a hobby of his.</p>

<p><label>Charon</label> Oh, so that is gold, that glittering yellow stuff, with just a tinge of red init. I have often heard of gold, but never saw it before.</p>

<p><label>Hermes</label> Yes, that is the stuff there isso much talking and squabbling about.</p>

<p><label>Charon</label> Well now, I see no advantages about it, unless it is an advantage that it is heavy to carry.</p>

<p><label>Hermes</label> Ah, you do not know what it has to answer for; the wars and plots and robberies, the perjuries and murders; for



<pb n="175"/>


this men will endure slavery and imprisonment; for this they traffic and sail the seas.;</p>

<p><label>Charon</label> For this stuff? Why, it is not much different from copper. I know copper, of course, because I get a penny from each passenger.</p>

<p><label>Hermes</label> Yes, but copper is plentiful, and therefore not much esteemed by men. Gold is found only in small quantities, and the miners have to go to a considerable depth for it. For the rest, it comes out of the earth, just the same as lead and other metals.</p>

<p><label>Charon</label> What fools men must be, to be enamoured of an object of this sallow complexion; and of such a weight!</p>

<p><label>Hermes</label> Well, Solon, at any rate, seems to have no great affection for it, See, he is making merry with Croesus and his outlandish magnificence. I think he is going to ask him a question. Listen.

</p></div>


<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="12">
<p><label>Solon</label> Croesus, will those bars be any use to Apollo, do you think?</p>

<p><label>Croesus</label> Any use! Why there is nothing at Delphi to be compared to them.</p>

<p><label>Solon</label> And that is all that is wanting to complete his happiness, eh?—some bar gold?</p>

<p><label>Croesus</label> Undoubtedly.</p>

<p><label>Solon</label> Then they must be very hard up in Heaven, if they have to send all the way to Lydia for their gold supply?</p>

<p><label>Croesus</label> Where else is gold to be had in such abundance as with us?</p>

<p><label>Solon</label> Now is any iron found in Lydia?</p>

<p><label>Croesus</label> Not much.</p>

<p><label>Solon</label> Ab; so you are lacking in the more valuable metal,</p>

<p><label>Croesus</label> More valuable? Iron more valuable than gold?</p>

<p><label>Solon</label> Bear with me, while I ask you a few questions, and I will convince you it is so.</p>

<p><label>Croesus</label> Well?</p>

<p><label>Solon</label> Of protector and protégé, which is the better man?



<pb n="176"/></p>

<p><label>Croesus</label> The protector, of course.</p>

<p><label>Solon</label> Now in the event of Cyrus’s invading Lydia—there is some talk of it—shall you supply your men with golden swords? or will tron be required on the occasion?</p>

<p><label>Croesus</label> Ob, iron.</p>

<p><label>Solon</label> Iron accordingly you must have, or your gold would be led captive into Persia?</p>

<p><label>Croesus</label> Blasphemer!</p>

<p><label>Solon</label> Ob, we will hope for the best. But it is clear, on your own admission, that iron is better than gold.</p>

<p><label>Croesus</label> And what would you have me do? Recall the gold, and offer the God bars of iron?</p>

<p><label>Solon</label> He has no occasion for iron either. Your offering (be the metal what it may) will fall into other hands than his. It will be snapped up by the Phocians, or the Boeotians, or the God’s own priests; or by some tyrant or robber. Your goldsmiths have no interest for Apollo,</p>

<p><label>Croesus</label> You are always having a stab at my wealth. It is all envy!

</p></div>


<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="13">
<p><label>Hermes</label> This blunt sincerity is not to the Lydian’s taste. Things are come to a strange pass, he thinks, if a poor man is to hold up his head, and speak his mind in this frank manner! He will remember Solon presently, when the time comes for Cyrus to conduct him in chains to the pyre. I heard Clotho, the other day, reading over the various dooms. Among other things, Croesus was to be led captive by Cyrus, and Cyrus to be murdered by the queen of the Massagetae. There she is: that Scythian woman, riding on a white horse; do you see?</p>

<p><label>Charon</label> Yes.</p>

<p><label>Hermes</label> That is Tomyris. She will cut off Cyrus’s head, and put it into a wine-skin filled with blood. And do you see his son, the boy there? That is Cambyses. He will succeed to his father’s throne; and, after innumerable defeats in Libya



<pb n="177"/>


and Ethiopia, will finally slay the god Apis, and die a raving madman.</p>

<p><label>Charon</label> What fun! Why, at this moment no one would presume to meet their eyes; from such a height do they look down on the rest of mankind. Who would believe that before long one of them will be a captive, and the other have his head in a bottle of blood?—</p></div>


<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="14">
<p>But who is that in the purple robe, Hermes?— the one with the diadem? His cook has just been cleaning a fish, and is now handing him a ring,—‘in yonder sea-girt isle’; ''tis, sure, some king.'</p>

He is extremely well pleased with his lot: yet that slave who now stands at his side will betray him to the satrap Oroetes, and he will be crucified. It will not take long to overturn his prosperity, poor man! This, too, I had from Clotho.</p>

<p><label>Charon</label> I like Clotho; she is a lady of spirit. Have at them, madam! Off with their heads! To the cross with them!
Let them know that they are men. And let them be exalted in the meantime; the higher they mount, the heavier will be the fall. I shall have a merry time of it hereafter, identifying their naked shades, as they come aboard; no more purple robes then; no tiaras; no golden couches!

<p><label>Hermes</label> So much for royalty; and now to the common herd. Do you see them, Charon;—on their ships and on the field of battle; crowding the law-courts and following the plough; usurers here, beggars there?</p>

<p><label>Charon</label> I see them. What a jostling life it is! What a world of ups and downs! Their cities remind me of bee-hives. Every man keeps a sting for his neighbour’s service; and a few, like wasps, make spoil of their weaker brethren. But what are all these misty shapes that beset them on every side?</p>

<p><label>Hermes</label> Hopes, Fears, Follies, Pleasures, Greeds, Hates, Grudges,





<pb n="178"/>


and such like. They differ in their habits. The Folly is a domestic creature, with vested rights of its own. The same with the Grudge, the Hate, the Envy, the Greed, the Knownot, and the What’s-to-do. But the Fear and the Hope fly overhead. The Fear swoops on its prey from above; sometimes it is content with startling a man out of his wits, sometimes it frightens him in real earnest. The Hope hovers almost within reach, and just when a man thinks he is going to catch it, off it flies, and leaves him gaping—like Tantalus in the water, you know.</p></div>


<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="16">
<p>Now look ¢losely, and you will make out the Fates up aloft, spinning each man his spindle-full; from that spindle a man hangs by a narrow thread. Do you see what looks like a cobweb, coming down to each man from the spindles?</p>

<p><label>Charon</label> I see each has a very slight thread. They are mostly entangled, one with another, and that other with a third.</p>

<p><label>Hermes</label> Of course they are. Because the first man has got to be murdered by the second, and he by the third; or again, B is to be A’s heir (A’s thread being the shorter), and C is to be B’s, That is what the entangling means. But you see what thin threads they all have to depend on. Now here is one drawn high up into the air; presently his thread will snap, when the weight becomes too much for it, and down he will come with a bang: whereas yonder fellow hangs so low that when he does fall it makes no noise; his next-door neighbours will scarcely hear him drop.</p>

<p><label>Charon</label> How absurd it all is!

</p></div>


<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="17">
<p><label>Hermes</label> My dear Charon, there is no word for the absurdity of it. They do take it all so seriously, that is the best of it; and then, long before they have finished scheming, up comes good old Death, and whisks them off, and all is over! You observe that he has a fine staff of assistants at his command;—agues, consumptions, fevers, inflammations, swords, robbers, hemlock,





<pb n="179"/>


juties, tyrants,—not one of which gives them a moment’s concern so long as they are prosperous; but when they come to grief, then it is Alack! and Well-a-day! and Oh dear me!
If only they would start with a clear understanding that they are mortal, that after a brief sojourn on the earth they will wake from the dream of life, and leave all behind them,—they would live more sensibly, and not mind dying so much. As it is, they get it into their heads that what they possess they possess for good and all; the consequence is, that when Death’s officer calls for them, and claps on a fever or a consumption, they take it amiss; the parting is so wholly unexpected. Yonder is a man building his house, urging the workmen to use all dispatch. How would he take the news, that he was just to see the roof on and all complete, when he would have to take his departure, and leave all the enjoyment to his heir?—hard fate, not once to sup beneath it! There again is one rejoicing over the birth of a son; the child is to inherit his grandfather’s name, and the father is celebrating the occasion with his friends. He would not be so pleased, if he knew that the boy was to die before he was eight years old! It is natural enough: he sees before him some happy father of an Olympian victor, and has no eyes for his neighbour there, who is burying a child; that thin-spun thread escapes, his notice. Behold, too, the moneygtubbers, whom the aforesaid Death’s-oficers will never permit to be money-spenders; and the noble army of litigant neighbours!

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="18">
<p><label>Charon</label> Yes! I see it all; and I ask myself, what is the satisfaction in life? What is it that men bewail the loss of? Take their kings; they seem to be best off, though, as you say, they have their happiness on a precarious tenure; but apart from that, we shall find their pleasures to be cuewelghed by the vexations inseparable from their position—worry and anxiety, flattery here, conspiracy there, enmity everywhere; to say

nothing of the tyranny of Sorrow, Disease, and Passion, with whom there is confessedly no respect of persons. And if the king’s lot is a hard one, we may make a pretty shrewd guess at that of the commoner.</p></div>

<p>Come now, I will give you a similitude for the life of man. Have you ever stood at the foot of a waterfall, and marked the bubbles rising to the surface and gathering into foam? Some are quite small, and break as soon as they are born. Others last longer; new ones come to join them, and they swell up to a great size: yet in the end they burst, as surely as the rest; it cannot be otherwise. There you have human life. All men are bubbles, great or small, inflated with the breath of life. Some are destined to last for a brief space, others perish in the very moment of birth: but all must inevitably burst.</p>

Now that we are up here, how would it be for me to cry out to them at the top of my voice, to abstain from their vain endeavours, and live with the prospect of Death before their eyes?
‘Fools’ (I might say), ‘why so much in earnest? Rest from your toils. You will not live for ever. Nothing of the pomp of this world will endure; nor can any man take anything hence when he dies. He will go naked out of the world, and his house and his lands and his gold will be another’s, and ever another’s.’ If I were to call out something of this sort, loud enough for them to hear, would it not do some good? Would not the world be the better for it?

<p><label>Charon</label> Well then, we might call out to them?</p>

<p><label>Hermes</label> There again: where would be the use of telling them what they know already? See, they stand aloof from the rest of mankind, and scoff at all that goes on; nothing is as they would have it. Nay, they are evidently bent on giving life the slip, and joining you. Their condemnations of folly make them unpopular here.</p>

<p><label>Hermes</label> Ah, sepulchres, those are called, or tombs, or graves. Well, do you see those mounds, and columns, and pyramids, outside the various city walls? Those are the store-chambers of the dead.</p>

<p><label>Charon</label> Why, they are putting flowers on the stones, and pouring costly essences upon them. And in front of some of the mounds they have piled up faggots, and dug trenches. Look: there is a splendid banquet laid out, and they are burning it all; and pouring wine and mead, I suppose it is, into the trenches!
What does it all mean?</p>

<p><label>Hermes</label> What satisfaction it affords to their friends in Hades, I am unable to say. But the idea is, that the shades come up, and get as close as they can, and feed upon the savoury steam of the meat, and drink the mead in the trench.

He will first have a question to ask himself: Is he to call them devout worshippers or very outcasts, who think so meanly of God as to suppose that he can require anything at the hand of man, can take pleasure in their flattery, or be wounded by their neglect? Thus the afflictions of the Calydonians, that long tale of misery and violence, ending with the death of Meleager—all is attributed to the resentment of Artemis, at Oeneus’s neglect in not inviting her to a feast. She must have taken the disappointment very much to heart. I fancy I see her, poor Goddess, left all alone in Heaven, after the rest have set out for Calydon, brooding darkly over the fine spread at which she will not be present.</p></div>

With the Gods, clearly, nothing goes for nothing. Each blessing has its price. Health is to be had, say, for a calf; wealth, for a couple of yoke of oxen; a kingdom, for a hecatomb. A safe conduct from Troy to Pylos has fetched as much as nine bulls, and a passage from Aulis to Troy has been quoted at a princess, For six yoke of oxen and a robe, Athene sold Hecuba a reprieve for Troy; and it is to be presumed that a cock, a garland, a handful of frankincense, will each buy something.

<p>And now that I have mentioned Apollo, I cannot refrain from an allusion to certain other passages in his life, which are recorded by the sages. With his unfortunate love affairs— the sad end of Hyacinth, and the cruelty of Daphne—we are not concerned, But when that vote of censure was passed on him for the slaughter of the Cyclopes, he was dismissed from Heaven, and condemned to share the fortunes of men upon earth. It was then that he served Admetus in Thessaly, and Laomedon in Phrygia; and in the latter service he was not alone. He and Posidon together, since better might not be, made bricks and built the walls of Troy; and did not even get their full wages;—the Phrygian, it is said, remained their debtor for no less a sum than five-and-twenty shillings Trojan, and odd pence.</p></div>

<p>These, and yet holier mysteries than these, are the high themes of our poets. They tell of Hephaestus and of Prometheus; of Cronus and Rhea, and well-nigh all the family of Zeus. And as they never commence their poems without bespeaking the assistance of the Muses, we must conclude that it is under that divine inspiration that they sing, how Cronus unmanned his father Uranus, and was king ‘in his room; and how, like Argive Thyestes, he swallowed his own children; and how thereafter Rhea saved Zeus by the fraud of the stone, and the child was exposed in Crete, and suckled by a goat, as Telephus was by a hind, and Cyrus the Great by a bitch; and how he dethroned his father, and threw him into prison, and was king; and of his many wives, and how finally (like a Persian or an Assyrian) he married his own sister Hera; and of his love adventures, and how he peopled the Heaven with gods, ay, and with demi-gods, the rogue! for he wooed the daughters of earth, appearing to them now in a shower of gold, now in the form of a bull or a swan or an

<p>Similarly, we find Hera conceiving without external assistance, and giving birth to Hephaestus; no child of fortune he, but a base mechanic, living all his life at the forge, soot-begrimed as any stoker. He is not even sound of limb; he has been lame ever since Zeus threw him down from Heaven. Fortunately for us the Lemnians broke his fall, or there would have been an end of him, as surely as there was of Astyanax when he was flung from the battlements. But Hephaestus is nothing to Prometheus. Who knows not the sorrows of that officious philanthropist? How he too fell a victim to the wrath of Zeus, and was carried into Scythia, and nailed up on Caucasus, with an eagle to keep him company and make daily havoc of his liver?</p></div>

<p>The life of the Gods being such as I have described, our religious ordinances are in admirable harmony with the divine requirements, Our first care has been to supply each God with his sacred grove, his holy hill, and his own peculiar bird or plant.

Apollo has the freedom of Delphi and Delos, Athene that of Athens (there is no disputing Aer nationality); Hera is an Argive, Rhea a Mygdonian, Aphrodite a Paphian. As for Zeus he is a Cretan born and bred—and buried, as any native of that island will show you. It was a mistake of ours to suppose that Zeus was dispensing the thunder and the rain and the

<p>As it would never have done to leave the Gods without a hearth and home, temples were now erected,-and the services of Phidias, Polyclitus, and Praxiteles were called in to create images in their likeness. Chance glimpses of their originals
(but where obtained I know not) enabled these artists to do justice to the beard of Zeus, the perpetual youth of Apollo, the down on Hermes’s cheek, Posidon’s sea-green hair, and Athene’s flashing eyes; with the result that on entering the temple of Zeus men believe that they see before them, not Indian ivory, nor gold from a Thracian mine, but the veritable son of Cronus and Rhea, translated to earth by the hand of Phidias, with instructions to keep watch over the deserted plains of Pisa, and content with his lot, if, once in four years, a spectator of the games can snatch a moment to pay him sacrifice.

<p>And now the altars stand ready; proclamation has been made, and lustration duly performed. The victims are accordingly brought forward—an ox from the plough, a ram or a goat, according as the worshipper is a farmer, a shepherd, or a goatherd; sometimes it is only frankincense or a honey cake; nay, a poor man may conciliate the God by merely kissing his hand. But it is with the priests that we are concerned. They first make sure that the victim is without blemish, and worthy of the sacrificial knife; then they crown him with garlands and lead him to the altar, where he is slaughtered before the God’s eyes, to the broken accompaniment of his own sanctimonious bellowings, most musical, most melancholy. The delight of the Gods at such a spectacle, who can doubt?

And wouldst thou know the truth that lurks herein?

If so, you will find no lack of sages and scribes and shaven priests to inform you (after expulsion of the profanum vulgus) how, when the Giants and their other enemies rose against them, the Gods fled to Egypt to hide themselves, and there took the form of goat and ram, of bird and reptile, which forms they preserve to this day.

Wipe the blush from your cheek for ever. Your hunting-ground will be the crowded city. You will live alone in its midst, holding communion with none, admitting neither friend nor guest; for such would undermine your power. Scruple not to perform the deeds of darkness in broad daylight: select your love-adventures with a view to the public entertainment: and finally, when the fancy takes you, swallow a raw cuttle-fish, and die. Such are the delights of Cynicism.

<p>Second D, Oh, vile creed! Monstrous creed! Avaunt!</p>

<p><label>Diogenes</label> But look you, it is all so easy; it is within every man’s reach. No education is necessary, no nonsensical argumentation. I offer you a short cut to Glory.

Given brass and boldness, you have only to learn to wag your tongue with dexterity.</p>

<p><label>Heraclitus</label> Please not to worry him with questions, sir. He is drunk, and cannot answer; his tongue plays him tricks, as you see.</p>

<p><label>Third Dealer</label> And who in his senses would buy such an abandoned reprobate? How he smells of scent! And how he slips and staggers about! Well, you must speak for him, Hermes. What can he do? What is his line?</p>

<p><label>Heraclitus</label> Well, for any gentleman who is not strait-laced, who loves a pretty girl, a bottle, and a jolly companion, he is the very thing. He is also a past master in gastronomy, and a connoisseur in voluptuousness generally. He was educated at Athens, and has served royalty in Sicily<note n="196.1">See Aristippus in Notes.</note>, where he had a very good character. Here are his principles in a nutshell: Think the worst of things: make the most of things: get all possible pleasure out of things.</p>

<p><label>Fourth Dealer</label> Zeus! What a difference is here! One of them does nothing but laugh, and the other might be at a funeral; he is all tears—You there! what is the joke?</p>

<p><label>Fourth Dealer</label> So! You laugh at us? Our business is a toy?</p>

<p><label>Democritus</label> It is. There is no taking it seriously. All is vanity. Mere interchange of atoms in an infinite void.</p>

For the present, I think not of it; but the future!—the future is all bitterness. Conflagration and destruction of the world. I weep to think that nothing abides, All things are whirled together in confusion. Pleasure and pain, knowledge and ignorance, great and small; up and down they go, the playthings of Time.</p>

<p><label>Fourth Dealer</label> And Gods?</p>

<p><label>Heraclitus</label> Immortal men.</p>

<p><label>Fourth Dealer</label> So! Conundrums, fellow? Nuts to crack? You are a very oracle for obscurity.</p>

<p><label>Heraclitus</label> Your affairs do not interest me.</p>

<p><label>Heraclitus</label> Young and old, him that bids and him that bids not, a murrain seize you all!</p>

<p>Fifth D. Quite so. My mistake. Now what is your manner of life?</p>

<p><label>Socrates</label> I live in a city of my own building; I make my own laws, and have a novel constitution of my own.</p>

<p><label>Fifth Dealer</label> I should like to hear some of your statutes.</p>

<p><label>Socrates</label> You shall hear the greatest of them all. No woman shall be restricted to one husband. Every man who likes is her husband.</p>

<p><label>Fifth Dealer</label> What! Then the laws of adultery are clean swept away?</p>

<p><label>Socrates</label> I should think they were! and a world of hair-splitting with them.</p>

<p><label>Socrates</label> Nowhere. Were they anywhere, they were not what they are.

<p><label>Fifth Dealer</label> I see no signs of these ‘types’ of yours.</p>

<p><label>Socrates</label> Of course not; because you are spiritually blind. I see the counterparts of all things; an invisible you, an invisible me; everything is in duplicate.</p>

<p><label>Heraclitus</label> Eight pounds.</p>

<p><label>Sixth Dealer</label> Here you are. By the way, you might let me know what he likes to eat.</p>

<p><label>Heraclitus</label> Anything sweet. Anything with honey in it. Dried figs are his favourite dish.</p>

Who is for universal monopoly?</p>

<p><label>Seventh Dealer</label> How are we to understand that?</p>

<p><label>Heraclitus</label> Why, here is monopoly of wisdom, monopoly of beauty, monopoly of courage, monopoly of justice. Sole king, sole orator, sole legislator, sole millionaire.

<p><label>Seventh Dealer</label> And I suppose sole cook, sole tanner, sole carpenter, and all that?</p>

<p><label>Heraclitus</label> Presumably.

<p>Seventh D. Regard me as your purchaser, good fellow, and tell me all about yourself. I dare say you think it rather hard to be sold for a slave?</p>

<p><label>Chrysippus</label> Not at all. These things are beyond our control. And what is beyond our control is indifferent.</p>

<p><label>Seventh Dealer</label> I don’t see how you make that out.</p>

<p><label>Chrysippus</label> What! Have you yet to learn that of indifferentia some are praepostta and others rejecta?</p>

<p><label>Seventh Dealer</label> Still I don’t quite see.</p>

<p><label>Chrysippus</label> No; how should you? You are not familiar with our terms. You lack the comprebensio vist. The earnest student of logic knows this and more than this. He understands the nature of subject, predicate, and contingent, and the distinctions between them.</p>

<p><label>Seventh Dealer</label> Now in Wisdom’s name, tell me, pray, what is a predicate? what is a contingent? ‘There is a ring about those words that takes my fancy.</p>

<p><label>Chrysippus</label> With all my heart. A man lame in one foot knocks that foot accidentally against a stone, and gets a cut. Now the man is subject to lameness; which is the predicate. And the cut is a contingency.

</p></div>


<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="22">
<p>Seventh D. Oh, subtle! What else can you tell me?</p>

<p><label>Chrysippus</label> I have verbal involutions, for the better hampering, crippling, and muzzling of my antagonists. This is performed by the use of the far-famed syllogism.</p>

<p><label>Seventh Dealer</label> Syllogism! I warrant him a tough customer.</p>

<p><label>Chrysippus</label> Take a case. You have a child?</p>

<p><label>Seventh Dealer</label> Well, and what if I have?</p>

<p><label>Chrysippus</label> A crocodile catches him as he wanders along the bank of a river, and promises to restore him to you, if you will first



<pb n="201"/>


guess correctly whether he means to restore him or not. Which are you going to say?</p>

<p><label>Seventh Dealer</label> A difficult question. I don’t know which way I should get him back soonest. In Heaven’s hame, answer for me, and save the child before he is eaten up.</p>

<p><label>Chrysippus</label> Ha, ha. I will teach you far other things than that.</p>

<p><label>Seventh Dealer</label> For instance?</p>

<p><label>Chrysippus</label> There is the ‘Reaper.’ There is the ‘Rightful Owner.’
Better still, there is the ‘Electra’ and the ‘Man in the Hood.’</p>

<p><label>Seventh Dealer</label> Who was he? and who was Electra?</p>

<p><label>Chrysippus</label> She was the Electra, the daughter of Agamemnon, to whom the same thing was known and unknown at the same time. She knew that Orestes was her brother: yet when he stood before her she did not know (until he revealed himself) that her brother was Orestes. As to the Man in the Hood, he will surprise you considerably. Answer me now: do you know your own father?</p>

<p><label>Seventh Dealer</label> Yes.</p>

<p><label>Chrysippus</label> Well now, if I present to you a man in a hood, shall you know him? eh?</p>

<p><label>Seventh Dealer</label> Of course not.

</p></div>


<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="23">
<p><label>Chrysippus</label> Well, but the Man in the Hood is your father. You don’t know the Man in the Hood. Therefore you don’t know your own father.</p>

<p><label>Seventh Dealer</label> Why, no. But if I take his hood off, I shall get at the facts. Now tell me, what is the end of your philosophy?
What happens when you reach the goal of virtue?</p>

<p><label>Chrysippus</label> In regard to things external, health, wealth, and the like, I am then all that Nature intended me to be. But there is much previous toil to be undergone. You will first sharpen your eyes on minute manuscripts, amass commentaries, and get your bellyful of outlandish terms. Last but not least, it is forbidden to be wise without repeated doses of hellebore.



<pb n="202"/></p>

<p><label>Seventh Dealer</label> All this is exalted and magnanimous to a degree. But what am I to think when I find that you are also the creed of cent-per-cent, the creed of the usurer? Has be swallowed his hellebore? is be made perfect in virtue?</p>

<p><label>Chrysippus</label> Assuredly. On none but the wise man does usury sit well, Consider. His is the art of putting two and two together, and usury is the art of putting interest together. The two are evidently connected, and one as much as the other is the prerogative of the true believer; who, not content, like common men, with simple interest, will also take interest upon interest. For interest, as you are probably aware, is of two kinds. There is simple interest, and there is its offspring, compound interest. Hear Syllogism on the subject. ‘If I take simple interest, I shall also take compound. But I shall take simple interest: therefore I shall take compound.’

</p></div>


<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="24">
<p>Seventh D, And the same applies to the fees you take from your youthful pupils? None but the true believer sells virtue for a fee?</p>

<p><label>Chrysippus</label> Quite right. I take the fee in my pupil’s interest, not because I want it. The world is made up of diffusion and accumulation. I accordingly practise my pupil in the former, and myself in the latter.</p>

<p><label>Seventh Dealer</label> But it ought to be the other way. The pupil ought to accumulate, and you, ‘sole millionaire,’ ought to diffuse.</p>

<p><label>Chrysippus</label> Ha! you jest with me? Beware of the shaft of insoluble syllogism.</p>

<p><label>Seventh Dealer</label> What harm can that do?
</p></div>


<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="25">
<p><label>Chrysippus</label> It cripples; it ties the tongue, and turns the brain. Nay, I have but to will it, and you are stone this instant.</p>

<p><label>Seventh Dealer</label> Stone! You are no Perseus, friend?</p>

<p><label>Chrysippus</label> See here. A stone is a body?</p>

<p><label>Seventh Dealer</label> Yes.</p>

<p><label>Chrysippus</label> Well, and an animal is a body?


<pb n="203"/></p>

<p><label>Seventh Dealer</label> Yes.</p>

<p><label>Chrysippus</label> And you are an animal?</p>

<p><label>Seventh Dealer</label> I suppose I am.</p>

<p><label>Chrysippus</label> ‘Therefore you are a body. Therefore a stone.</p>

<p><label>Seventh Dealer</label> Mercy, in Heaven’s name! Unstone me, and let me be flesh as heretofore.</p>

<p><label>Chrysippus</label> That is soon done. Back with you into flesh! Thus:
Is every body animate?</p>

<p><label>Seventh Dealer</label> No.</p>

<p><label>Chrysippus</label> Is a stone animate?</p>

<p><label>Seventh Dealer</label> No.</p>

<p><label>Chrysippus</label> Now, you are a body?</p>

<p><label>Seventh Dealer</label> Yes.</p>

<p><label>Chrysippus</label> And an animate body?</p>

<p><label>Seventh Dealer</label> Yes.</p>

<p><label>Chrysippus</label> Then being animate, you cannot be a stone.</p>

<p><label>Seventh Dealer</label> Ah! thank you, thank you. I was beginning to feel my limbs growing numb and solidifying like Niobe’s. Oh, I must have you. What’s to pay?</p>

<p><label>Heraclitus</label> Fifty pounds.</p>

<p><label>Seventh Dealer</label> Here it is.</p>

<p><label>Heraclitus</label> Are you sole purchaser?</p>

<p><label>Seventh Dealer</label> Not I. All these gentlemen here are going shares.</p>

<p><label>Heraclitus</label> A fine strapping lot of fellows, and will do the ‘Reaper’ credit.

<p><label>Eighth Dealer</label> How can that be?</p>

<p><label>Heraclitus</label> Why, he is one creed outside, and another inside. So remember, if you buy him, one of him is called Esoteric, and the other Exoteric.</p>

<p><label>Eighth Dealer</label> And what has he to say for himself?</p>

<p><label>Heraclitus</label> He has to say that there are three kinds of good: spiritual, corporeal, circumstantial,</p>

<p><label>Eighth Dealer</label> There’s something a man can understand. How much is he?</p>

<p><label>Heraclitus</label> Eighty pounds.</p>

<p><label>Eighth Dealer</label> Eighty pounds is a long price.</p>

<p><label>Heraclitus</label> Not at all, my dear sir, not at all. You see, there is some money with him, to all appearance. Snap him up before it is too late. Why, from him you will find out in no time how long a gnat lives, to how many fathoms’ depth the sunlight penetrates the sea, and what an oyster’s soul is like.</p>

<p><label>Eighth Dealer</label> Heracles! Nothing escapes him.</p>

<p><label>Heraclitus</label> Ah, these are trifles. You should hear some of his more abstruse speculations, concerning generation and birth and the development of the embryo; and his distinction between man, the laughing creature, and the ass, which is neither a laughing nor a carpentering nor a shipping creature.</p>

<p><label>Eighth Dealer</label> Such knowledge is as useful as it is ornamental. Eighty pounds be it, then.

<p><label>Scepticism</label> And with them judgement and perception, and all, in short, that distinguishes man from a worm.</p>

<p><label>Ninth Dealer</label> Nay, doubt it not! You are bought and paid for.</p>

<p><label>Scepticism</label> It is a difficult case.... I reserve my decision.</p>

<p><label>Platonists</label> What harm you have done us, vile fellow? your own conscience and your fine dialogues will tell you; you have called Philosophy herself bad names, and as for us, you have subjected us to the indignity of a public auction, and put up wise men— ay, and free men, which is more—for sale. We have reason to be angry; we have got a short leave of absence from Hades, and come up against you—Chrysippus here, Epicurus and myself, Aristotle yonder, the taciturn Pythagoras, Diogenes and all of us that your dialogues have made so free with.

<p><label>Lucian</label> Believe me, good gentlemen, I have been at much pains on your behalf; to slay me is to slay one who should rather be selected for commendation; a kindred spirit, a well-wisher, a man after your own heart, a promoter, if I may be bold to say it, of your pursuits, See to it that you catch not the tone of our latter-day philosophers, and be thankless, petulant, and hard of heart, to him that deserves better of you.</p>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="6">
<p><label>Lucian</label> How or when was I ever insolent to you? I have always been an admirer of philosophy, your panegyrist, and a student of the writings you left. All that comes from my pen is but what you give me; I deflower you, like a bee, for the behoof of mankind; and then there is praise and recognition; they know the flowers, whence and whose the honey was, and the manner of my gathering; their surface feeling is for my selective art, but deeper down it is for you and your meadow, where you put forth such bright blooms and myriad dyes, if one knows but how to sort and mix and match, that one be not in discord with another. Could he that had found you such have the heart to abuse those benefactors to whom his little fame was due? then he must be a Thamyris or Eurytus, defying the Muses who gave his gift of song, or challenging Apollo with the bow, forgetful from whom he had his marksmanship.

Appoint a judge, then; be you my accusers, by your own mouths or by your chosen representative; and let me defend my own case; then if I be convicted of wrong, and that be the court’s decision, I shall get my deserts, and you will have no violence upon your consciences.

<p><label>Lucian</label> Oh, be reassured. The official I think of proposing is no suspicious, dubious character likely to sell a verdict. What say you to forming the court yourselves, with Philosophy for your President?</p>

<p><label>Platonists</label> Who is to prosecute, if we are the jury?</p>

<p><label>Lucian</label> Oh, you can do both; I am not in the least afraid; so much stronger is my case; the defence wins, hands down.

<p><label>Platonists</label> Pythagoras, Socrates, what do you think? perhaps the man’s appeal to law is not unreasonable.</p>

<p><label>Socrates</label> No; come along, form the court, fetch Philosophy, and I see what he has to say for himself. To condemn unheard is a sadly crude proceeding, not for us; leave that to the hasty people with whom might is right. We shall give occasion to the enemy to blaspheme if we stone 2 man without a hearing, professed lovers of justice as we are. We shall have to keep quiet about Anytus and Meletus, my accusers, and the jury on that occasion, if we cannot spare an hour to hear this fellow before he suffers.</p>

<p><label>Lucian</label> Why, now, my masters, you are in a better and more law-abiding mood. However, keep those stones, as I said; you will need them in court. But where is Philosophy to be found?
I do not know where she lives, myself. I once spent a long time wandering about in search of her house, wishing to make her acquaintance. Several times I met some long-bearded people in threadbare cloaks who professed to be fresh from her presence; I took their word for it, and asked them the way; but they knew considerably less about it than I, and either declined to answer, by way of concealing their ignorance, or else pointed to one door after another. I have never been able to find the right one to this day.

</p></div>


<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="12">
<p>Many a time, upon some inward prompting or external offer of guidance, I have come to a door with the confident hope that this time I really was right; there was such a crowd flowing in and out, all of solemn persons decently habited and thoughtfulfaced; I would insinuate myself into the press and go in too. What I found would be a woman who was not really natural, however skilfully she played at beauty unadorned; I could see at once that the apparent négligé of her hair was studied for effect, and the folds of her dress not so careless as they looked. One could tell that nature was a scheme of decoration with her, and artlessness an artistic device. The white lead and the rouge did not absolutely defy detection, and her talk betrayed her real vocation; she liked her lovers to appreciate her beauty, had a ready hand for presents, made room by her side for the rich, and hardly vouchsafed her poorer lovers a distant glance. Now and then, when her dress came a little open by accident, I saw that she had on a massive gold necklace heavier than a penal collar. That was enough for me; I would retrace my steps, sincerely pitying the unfortunates whom she led by the—beard, and their Ixion-embracings of a phantom.

I should think it is near her hour for coming back from the Academy, and taking her walk in the Poecile; she is very regular; to be sure, here she comes. Do you see the orderly, rather prim lady there, with the kindly look in her eyes, and the slow meditative walk?</p>

<p><label>Lucian</label> I see several answering the description so far as looks and walk and clothes go. Yet among them all the real lady Philosophy can be but one.</p>

But what is your profession? that at least is essential.

</p></div>


<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="20">
<p><label>Lucian</label> I profess hatred of pretension and imposture, lying, and pride; the whole loathsome tribe of them I hate; and you know how numerous they are.</p>

<p><label>Philosophy</label> Upon my word, you must have your hands full at this profession!</p>

<p><label>Lucian</label> I have; you see what general dislike and danger it brings upon me. However, I do not neglect the complementary branch, in which love takes the place of hate; it includes love of truth and beauty and simplicity and all that is akin to love. But the subjects for this branch of the profession are sadly few; those of the other, for whom hatred is the right treatment, are reckoned by the thousand. Indeed there is some danger of the one feeling being atrophied, while the other is over-developed.</p>

<p><label>Philosophy</label> That should not be; they run in couples, you know. Do not separate your two branches; they should have unity in diversity.</p>

<p><label>Lucian</label> You know better than I, Philosophy. My way is just to hate a villain, and love and praise the good.

<p><label>Philosophy</label> So. Now we are seated, ready to hear your words. Choose one of your number, the best accuser you may, make your charge, and bring your proofs. Were all to speak, there would be no end. And you, Parrhesiades, shall afterwards make your defence.</p>

<p><label>Chrysippus</label> Plato, none of us will conduct the prosecution better than you. Your thoughts are heaven-high, your style the perfect Attic; grace and persuasion, insight and subtlety, the cogency of welltordered proof—all these are gathered in you. Take the spokesman’s office and say what is fitting on our behalf. Call to memory and roll in one all that ever you said against Gorgias, Polus, Hippias, Prodicus; you have now to do with a worse than them.

<p><label>Diogenes</label> Antisthenes, Crates, or yourself, Chrysippus. It is no time now for beauty or literary skill; controversial and forensic resource is what we want. This Parrhesiades is an orator.</p>

<p><label>Diogenes</label> Let me be accuser; no need for long speeches here. Moreover, I was the worst treated of all; threepence was my price the other day.</p>

<p><label>Platonists</label> Philosophy, Diogenes will speak for us. But mind, friend, you are not to represent yourself alone, but think of us all.

I need not dwell long upon them. Of myself I say nothing; but Pythagoras, Plato, Aristotle, Chrysippus, and the rest— who knows not the benefits that they conferred on mankind?
I will come at once, then, to the insults to which we have been subjected by the thrice accursed Parrhesiades. He was, by his own account, an advocate; but he has left the courts and the fame there to be won, and has availed himself of all the verbal skill and proficiency so acquired for a campaign of abuse against us. We are impostors and deceivers; his audiences must ridicule and scorn us for nobodies. Did I say ‘nobodies’? he has made us an abomination, rather, in the eyes of the vulgar, and yourself with us, Philosophy. Your teachings are balderdash and rubbish; the noblest of your precepts to us he parodies, winning for himself applause and approval, and for us humiliation, For so it is with the great public; it loves a master of flouts and jeers, and loves him in proportion to the grandeur of what he assails; you know how it delighted long ago in Aristophanes and Eupolis, when they caricatured our Socrates on

Worst of all, Philosophy, he shelters himself under your name, entices Dialogue from our company to be hig ally and mouthpiece, and induces our good comrade Menippus to collaborate constantly with him; Menippus, more by token, is the one deserter and absentee on this occasion.

Tame submission to insult would naturally enough be taken, not for moderation, but for insensibility and want of spirit. Who could be expected to put up with his last performance? He brought us to market like a gang of slaves, and handed us over to the auctioneer. Some, I believe, fetched high prices; but others went for four or five pounds, and as for me—confound his impudence, threepence! And fine fun the audience had out of it!

Any of these that have been omitted by him, and not previously emphasized by myself, I propose now to quote; this will be the best way to show you who were the persons that I sold by auction and inveighed against as pretenders and impostors; please to concentrate your vigilance on the truth or falsehood of my descriptions. If what I say is injurious or severe, your censure will be more fairly directed at the perpetrators than at the discoverer of such iniquities.

Then I was wroth; methought it was as though some soft womanish actor on the tragic stage should give us Achilles or Theseus or Heracles himself; he cannot stride nor speak out as a Hero should, but minces along under his enormous mask; Helen or Polyxena would find him too realistically feminine to pass for them; and what shall an invincible Heracles say?

But what most distressed me, Philosophy, was this: when one of these people was detected in rascality, impropriety, or immorality, every one put it down to philosophy, and to the particular philosopher whose name the delinquent took in vain without ever acting on his principles; the living rascal disgraced you, the long dead; for you were not there in the flesh to point the contrast; so, as’ it was clear enough that his life was vile and disgusting, your case was given away by association with his, and you had to share his disgrace.

All their professions of despising wealth and appearances, of admiring nothing but what is noble, of superiority to passion, of being proof against splendour, and associating with its owners only on equal terms—how fair and wise and laudable they all are!
But they take pay for-imparting them, they are abashed in presence of the rich, their lips water at sight of coin; they are dogs for temper,- hares for cowardice, apes for imitativeness, asses for lust, cats for thievery, cocks for jealousy. They are a perfect laughing-stock with their strivings after vile ends, their jostling of each other at rich men’s doors, their attendance at crowded dinners, and their vulgar obsequiousness at table.

There is a story of an Egyptian king who taught some apes the sword-dance; the imitative creatures very soon picked it up, and used to perform in purple robes and masks; for some time the show was a great success, till at last an ingenious spectator brought some nuts in with him and threw them down. The apes forgot their dancing at the sight, dropped their humanity, resumed their apehood, and, smashing masks and tearing dresses, had a free fight for the provender. Alas for the corps de ballet and the gravity of the audience!

I could have contained myself if there had been any touch of plausibility in their acting; but the vulture is more like the nightingale than they like philosophers. And now I have pleaded my cause to the best of my ability. Truth, I rely upon you to confirm my words.

<p><label>Philosophy</label> Parrhesiades, retire to a further distance. Well, and our verdict? How think you the man has spoken?</p>

<p><label>Truth</label> Ah, Philosophy, while he was speaking I was ready to sink through the ground; it was all so true. As I listened, I could identify every offender, and I was fitting caps all the time—this is so-and-so, that is the other man, all over. I tell you they were all as plain as in a picture—speaking likenesses not of their bodies only, but of their very souls.</p>

<p><label>Temperance</label> Yes, Truth, I could not help blushing at it.</p>

<p><label>Philosophy</label> What say you, gentlemen?</p>

<p><label>Resurgents</label> Why, of course, that he is acquitted of the charge, and stands recorded as our friend and benefactor. Our case is just that of the Trojans, who entertained the tragic actor only to find him reciting their own calamities. Well, recite away, our tragedian, with these pests of ours for dramatis personae.</p>

<p><label>Diogenes</label> I too, Philosophy, give him my meed of praise; I withdraw my charges, and count him a worthy friend.

<p><label>Syllogism</label> Oyez, oyez! All philosophers to the Acropolis to make their defence before Virtue, Philosophy, and Justice.</p>

<p><label>Parrhesiades</label> The proclamation does not bring them in flocks, does it? They have their reasons for keeping clear of Justice. And a good many of them are too busy with their rich friends. If you want them all to come, Syllogism, I will tell you what to say.</p>

a swarm of bees. In Homeric phrase, on this side are exceeding many, and on that

<l>Ten thousand, thick as leaves and flowers in spring.</l>

Noisily they settle, the Acropolis is covered with them in a trice; everywhere wallet and beard, flattery and effrontery, staves and greed, logic and avarice. The little company which came up at the first proclamation is swamped beyond recovery, swallowed up in these later crowds; it is hopeless to find them, because of the external resemblance. That is the worst of it, Philosophy; you are really open to censure for not marking and labelling them; these impostors are often more convincing than the true philosophers.</p>

<p><label>Philosophy</label> Ah, good honest man! such were his little necessaries for the philosophic life, such his title to indulge in general abuse and instruct his neighbours.</p>

<p><label>Parrhesiades</label> There you have them. The problem before you is, how the general ignorance is to be dispersed, and other people enabled to discriminate between the genuine and the other sort. Find the solution, Truth; for indeed it concerns you; Falsehood must not prevail; shall Ignorance shield the base while they counterfeit the good, and you never know it?

<p><label>Truth</label> I think we had better give Parrhesiades this commission; he has been shown an honest man, our friend and your true admirer, Philosophy.

<p><label>Philosophy</label> Well planned, Truth. And, Parrhesiades, here is a test for you; you know how young eagles are supposed to bé tested by the sun; well, our candidates have not got to satisfy us that they can look at light, of course; but put gold, fame, and pleasure before their eyes; when you see one remain

<p><label>Parrhesiades</label> Oh yes, if the priestess will lend me the line I see there and the Piraean fisherman’s votive hook; I will not keep them long.</p>

<p><label>Priestess of Athene</label> You can have them; and the rod to complete the equipment.</p>

<p><label>Parrhesiades</label> Thanks; now quickly, please, a few dried figs and a handful of gold.</p>

<p><label>Priestess of Athene</label> There.</p>

<p><label>Philosophy</label> What is all this about?</p>

<p><label>Priestess of Athene</label> He has baited his hook with the figs and gold, and is sitting on the parapet dangling it over the city.</p>

<p><label>Philosophy</label> What are you doing, Parrhesiades? do you think you are going to fish up stones from the Pelasgicum?</p>

<p><label>Parrhesiades</label> Hush! wait till I get a bite. Posidon, the fisherman’s friend, and you, dear Amphitrite, send me good fishing!

<p><label>Diogenes</label> Make him disgorge; we want the bait for some more.</p>

<p><label>Parrhesiades</label> There, then. Now, Diogenes, do you know who it is? has the fellow anything to do with you?</p>

<p><label>Diogenes</label> Nothing whatever.</p>

<p><label>Parrhesiades</label> Well, what do you put him at? threepence was the price fi I the other day.</p>

<p><label>Diogenes</label> Too much. His flavour and his looks are intolerable— a coarse worthless brute. Drop him head first over the rock, and catch another. But take care your rod does not bend to breaking point.</p>

<p><label>Parrhesiades</label> No fear; they are quite light—about the weight of a gudgeon.</p>

<p><label>Diogenes</label> About the weight and about the wit. However, up with them.

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="49">
<p><label>Parrhesiades</label> Look; what is this one? a sole? flat as a plate, thin as one of his own fillets; he gapes for the hook; down it goes; we have him; up he comes.</p>

<p><label>Exposure</label> His plateship would be a Platonist.</p>

<p><label>Platonists</label> You too after the gold, villain?</p>

<p><label>Aristotle</label> You need not apply to me; I do not know him.</p>

<p><label>Exposure</label> You had better sheathe a good bit of the line before you let it down; else he will gorge the gold and then saw the line through.</p>

<p><label>Exposure</label> Chrysippus.</p>

<p><label>Parrhesiades</label> Ah, he must have a master with gold in his name, must he? Chrysippus, tell me seriously, do you know these men? are you responsible for the way they live?</p>

<p><label>Chrysippus</label> My dear Parrhesiades, I take it ill that you should suggest any connexion between me and such creatures.</p>

<p><label>Charon</label> You see how it is, Clotho; here has all been ship-shape and ready for a start this long time; the hold baled out, the mast stepped, the sail hoisted, every oar in its rowlock; it is no fault of mine that we don’t weigh anchor and sail. 'Tis Hermes keeps us; he should have been here long ago. Not a passenger on board, as you may see; and we might have made the trip three times over by this. Evening is coming on now; and never a penny taken all day! I know how it will be: Pluto will think I have been wanting to my work. It is not I that am to blame, but our fine gentleman of a supercargo. He is just like any mortal: he has taken a drink of their Lethe up there, and forgotten to come back to us. He'll be wrestling with the lads, or playing on his lyre, or giving his precious gift of the gab a good airing; or he’s off after plunder, the rascal, for what I know: ’tis all in the day’s work with him. He is getting too independent: he ought to remember that he belongs to us, one half of him.

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="2">
<p><label>Clotho</label> Well, well, Charon; perhaps he has been busy: Zeus may have had some particular occasion for his services in the upper world; he has the use of him too, remember.</p>

<p><label>Charon</label> That doesn’t say that he should make use of him beyond



<pb n="231"/>


what’s reasonable. Hermes is common property. We have never kept him here when he was due to go. No, I know what itis. In these parts of ours all is mist and gloom and darkness, and nothing to be had but asphodel and libations and sacrificial cakes and meats, Yonder in Heaven, all’s bright, with plenty of ambrosia, and no end of nectar. Small wonder that he likes to loiter there. When he leaves us, ’tis on wings; it is as though he escaped from prison. But when the time comes for return, he tramps it on foot, and has much ado to get here at all.

</p></div>


<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="3">
<p><label>Clotho</label> Well, never mind now; here he comes, look, and a fine host of passengers with him; a fine flock, rather; he hustles them along with his staff like so many goats, But what’s this? One of them is bound, and another enjoying the joke; and there is one with a wallet slung beside him, and a stick in his hand; a cantankerous-looking fellow; he keeps the rest moving. And just look at Hermes! Bathed in perspiration, and his feetcovered with dust! See how he pants; he is quite out of breath. What is the matter, Hermes? Tell us all about it; you seem disturbed.</p>

<p><label>Hermes</label> The matter is that this rascal ran away; I had to go after him, and had well nigh played you false for this trip, I can tell you.</p>

<p><label>Clotho</label> Why, who is he? What did he want to run away for?</p>

<p><label>Hermes</label> His motive is sufficiently clear: he had a preference for remaining alive. He is some king or tyrant, as I gather from his piteous allusions to blessedness no longer his.</p>

<p><label>Clotho</label> And the fool actually tried to run away, and thought to prolong his life when the thread of Fate was exhausted?

</p></div>


<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="4">
<p><label>Hermes</label> Tried! He would have got clean away, but for that capital fellow there with the club; he gave me a hand, and we caught and bound him. The whole way along, from the moment that Atropus handed him over to me, he dragged and

hung back, and dug his heels into the ground: it was no easy work getting him along. Every now and then he would take to prayers and entreaties: Would I let him go just for a few minutes? he would make it worth my while. Of course I was not going to do that; it was out of the question.—Well, we had actually got to the very pit’s mouth, when somehow or other this double-dyed knave managed to slip off, whilst I was telling over the Shades to Aeacus, as usual, and he checking them by your sister’s invoice. The consequence was, we were one short of tally. Aeacus raised his eyebrows. ‘Hermes,’ he said, ‘everything in its right place: no larcenous work here, please. You play enough of those tricks in Heaven. We keep strict accounts here: nothing escapes us. The invoice says
1,004; there it is in black and white. You have brought me one short, unless you say that Atropus was too clever for you.’
I coloured up at that; and then all at once I remembered what had happened on the way, and when I looked round and this fellow was nowhere to be seen, I knew that he must have made off, and I set off after him along the road to the upper world, as fast as I could go. My worthy friend here volunteered for the service; so we made a race of it, and caught the runaway just as he got to Taenarum! It was a near thing.

<p><label>Clotho</label> True. Let them come aboard. I’ll to my post by the gangway, with my notebook, and take their names and countries as they come up, and details of their deaths; and you can stow them away as you get them.—Hermes, let us have those babies in first; I shall get nothing out of them.</p>

They don’t hear me; they are deaf with age. I think you will have to pick them up, like the babies, and get them along that way.</p>

<p><label>Hermes</label> Here; you may know them by their wounds. Am I to bring the women too?</p>

<p><label>Clotho</label> Yes, certainly; and all who were shipwrecked; it is the same kind of death. And those who died of fever, bring them too, the doctor Agathocles and all.</p></div>

<p><label>Clotho</label> Wretch! How often have you prayed that he might survive you!</p>

<p><label>Megapenthes.</label> That was a long time ago. New,—I see a better use for him.</p>

<p><label>Clotho</label> But he is due to be here, shortly, let me tell you. He is to be put to death by the new sovereign.

</p></div>


<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="11">
<p><label>Megapenthes.</label> Well, Clotho, I hope you will not refuse my last request.</p>

<p><label>Clotho</label> Which is?</p>

<p><label>Megapenthes.</label> I should like to know how things will be, now that I am gone.</p>

<p><label>Clotho</label> Certainly; you shall have that mortification. Your wife will pass into the hands of Midas, your slave; he has been her gallant for some time past.</p>

<p><label>Megapenthes.</label> Acurse on him! 'Twas at her request that I gave him his freedom.</p>

<p><label>Clotho</label> Your daughter will take her place in the harem of the present monarch. ‘Then all the old statues and portraits which the city set up in your honour will be overturned,—to the entertainment, no doubt, of the spectators.</p>

<p><label>Megapenthes.</label> And will no friend resent these doings?</p>

<p><label>Clotho</label> Who was your friend? Who had any reason to be?
Need I explain that the cringing courtiers who lauded your every word and deed were actuated either by hope or by fear
—time-servers every man of them, with a keen eye to the main chance?</p>

<p><label>Megapenthes.</label> And these are they whose feasts rang with my name! who, as they poured their libations, invoked every blessing on my head! Not one but would have died before me, could he have had his will; nay, they swore by no other name.</p>

<p><label>Clotho</label> Yes; and you dined with one of them yesterday, and it cost you your life. It was that last cup you drank that brought you here.</p>

<p><label>Megapenthes.</label> Ah, I noticed a bitter taste—But what was his object?





<pb n="237"/></p>

<p><label>Clotho</label> Oh, you want to know too much. It is high time you came on board.

</p></div>


<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="12">
<p><label>Megapenthes.</label> Clotho, I had a particular reason for desiring one more glimpse of daylight. I have a burning grievance!</p>

<p><label>Clotho</label> And what is that? Something of vast importance, I make no doubt.</p>

<p><label>Megapenthes.</label> It is about my slave Carion. The moment he knew of my death, he came up to the room where I lay; it was late in the evening; he had plenty of time in front of him, for not a soul was watching by me; he brought with him my concubine Glycerium (an old affair, this, E suspect), closed the door, and proceeded to take his pleasure with her, as if no third person had been in the room! Having satisfied the demands of passion, he turned his attention to me. ‘You little villain,’ he cried, ‘many’s the flogging I’ve had from you, for no fault of mine!’ And as he spoke he plucked out my hair and smote me on the face. ‘Away with you,’ he cried finally, spitting on me, ‘away to the place of the damned!’—and so withdrew.
I burned with resentment: but there I lay stark and cold, and could do nothing. That baggage Glycerium, too, hearing footsteps approaching, moistened her eyes and pretended she had been weeping for me; and withdrew sobbing, and repeating my name.—If I could but get hold of them——

<p><label>Clotho</label> Never mind what you would do to them, but come on board. The hour is at hand when you must appear before the tribunal.</p>

<p><label>Megapenthes.</label> And who will presume to give his vote against a tyrant?</p>

<p><label>Clotho</label> Against a tyrant, who indeed? Against a Shade, Rhadamanthus will take that liberty. He is strictly impartial, as you will presently observe, in adapting his sentences to the requirements of individual cases. And now, no more delay.</p>

<p><label>Clotho</label> Where is the one with the stick? Hermes, you and he must drag him up feet foremost. He will never come up by himself.</p>

<p><label>Hermes</label> Come along, my runagate. Here you are, skipper. And I say, keep an eye——</p>

<p><label>Charon</label> Never fear. We'll lash him to the mast.</p>

<p><label>Megapenthes.</label> Look you, I must have the seat of honour.</p>

<p><label>Clotho</label> And why exactly?</p>

<p><label>Megapenthes.</label> Can you ask? Was I not a tyrant, with a guard of ten thousand men?</p>

<p><label>Cynic</label> Oh, dullard! And you complain of Carion’s pulling your hair! Wait till you get a taste of this stick; you shall know what it is to be a tyrant.</p>

<p><label>Megapenthes.</label> What, shall a Cynic dare to raise his staff against me? Sirrah, have you forgotten the other day, when I had all but nailed you to the cross, for letting that sharp censorious tongue of yours wag too freely?</p>

<p><label>Cynic</label> Well, and now it is your turn te be nailed,—to the mast.

<p><label>Micyllus</label> And what of me, mistress? Am I to be left out of the reckoning? Because I am poor, must I be the last to come aboard?</p>

<p><label>Clotho</label> Who are you?</p>

<p><label>Micyllus</label> Micyllus the cobbler.</p>

<p><label>Clotho</label> A cobbler, and cannot wait your turn? Look at the tyrant: see what bribes he offers us, only for a short reprieve. It is very strange that delay is not to your fancy too.</p>

<p><label>Micyllus</label> It is this way, my lady Fate. I find but cold comfort in that promise of the Cyclops: ‘Outis shall be eaten last,’ said he; but first or last, the same teeth are waiting. And then, it is not the same with me as with the rich. Our lives are what they call ‘diametrically opposed.’ This tyrant, now, was

thought happy while he lived; he was feared and respected by all: he had his gold and his silver; his fine clothes and his horses and his banquets; his smart pages and his handsome ladies,—and had to leave them all. No wonder if he was vexed, and felt the tug of parting. For I know not how it is, but these things are like birdlime: a man’s soul sticks to them, and will not easily come away; they have grown to be a part of him. Nay, ’tis as if men were bound in some chain that nothing can break; and when by sheer force they are dragged away, they cry out and beg for mercy. They are bold enough for aught else, but show them this .ame road to Hades, and they prove to be but cowards. They turn about, and must ever be looking back at what they have left behind them, far off though it be,—like men that are sick for love. So it was with the fool yonder: as we came along, he was for running away; and now he tires you with his entreaties.</p></div>


<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="15">
<p>As for me, I had no stake in life; lands and horses, money and goods, fame, statues,—I had none of them; I could not have been in better trim: it needed but one nod from Atropus,—I was busied about a boot at the time, but down I flung knife and leather with a will, jumped up, and never waited to get my shoes, or wash the blacking from my hands, but joined the procession there and then, ay, and headed it, looking ever forward; I had left nothing behind me that called for a backward glance. And, on my word, things begin to look well already. Equal rights for all, and no man better than his neighbour; that is hugely to my liking. And from what I can learn there is no collecting of debts in this country, and no taxes; better still, no shivering in winter, no sickness, no hard knocks from one’s betters. All is peace. The tables are turned: the laugh is with us poor men; it is the rich that make moan, and are ill at ease.

</p></div>


<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="16">
<p><label>Clotho</label> To be sure, I noticed that you were laughing, some time ago. What was it in particular that excited your mirth?



<pb n="240"/></p>

<p><label>Micyllus</label> I'll tell you, best of Goddesses. Being next door to a tyrant up there, I was all eyes for what went on in his house; and he seemed to me neither more nor less than a God. I saw the embroidered purple, the host of courtiers, the gold, the jewelled goblets, the couches with their feet of silver: and I thought, this is happiness. As for the sweet savour that arose when his dinner was getting ready, it was too much for me; such blessedness seemed more than human. And then his proud looks and stately walk and high carriage, striking admiration into all beholders! It seemed almost as if he must be handsomer than other men, and a good eighteen inches taller. But when he was dead, he made a queer figure, with all his finery gone; though I laughed more at myself than at him: there had I been worshipping mere scum on no better authority than the smell of roast meat, and reckoning happiness by the blood of Lacedaemonian sea-snails!</p></div>


<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="17">
<p>There was Gniphon the usurer, too, bitterly reproaching himself for having died without ever knowing the taste of wealth, leaving all his money to his nearest relation and heir-at-law, the spendthrift Rhodochares, when he might have had the enjoyment of it himself. When I saw him, I laughed as if I should never stop: to think of him as he used to be, pale, wizened, with a face full of care, his fingers the only rich part of him, for they had the talents to count,—scraping the money together bit by bit, and all to be squandered in no time by that favourite of Fortune, Rhodochares!—But what are we waiting for now? There will be time enough on the voyage to enjoy their woebegone faces, and have our laugh out.</p>

<p><label>Clotho</label> Come on board, and then the ferryman can haul up the anchor.

<p><label>Micyllus</label> What right have you to leave me behind,—a shade of twenty-four hours’ standing? I tell you what it is, I shall have you up before Rhadamanthus. A plague on it, she’s moving!
And here I shall be left all by myself. Stay, though: why not swim across in their wake? No matter if I get tired; a dead man will scarcely be drowned. Not to mention that I have not a penny to pay my fare.</p>

<p><label>Clotho</label> Micyllus! Stop! You must not come across that way; Heaven forbid!</p>

<p><label>Micyllus</label> Ha, ha! I shall get there first, and I shouldn’t wonder.</p>

<p><label>Clotho</label> This will never do, We must get to him, and pick him up.... Hermes, give him a hand up.

<p><label>Charon</label> And where is he to sit now he is here?_ We are full up, as you may see,</p>

<p><label>Charon</label> Up with you then; and make the rascal’s back ache. And now, good luck to our voyage!</p>

<p><label>Cynic</label> Charon, I may as well tell you the plain truth at once. The penny for my fare is not forthcoming; -I have nothing but my wallet, look, and this stick, But if you want a hand at baling, here I am; or I could take an oar; only give me a good stout one, and you shall have no fault to find with me.</p>

<p><label>Charon</label> To it, then; and I’ll ask no other payment of you.</p>

<p><label>Cynic</label> Shall I tip them a stave?</p>

<p><label>Charon</label> To be sure, if you have a sea-song about you.</p>

<p><label>Cynic</label> I have several. Look here though, an opposition is starting: a song of lamentation. It will throw me out.

quite improper that any shade should cross the stream, and make no moan.</p>

<p><label>Micyllus</label> Get along with you. What have I to dowith Ohs and Ahs? I’m enjoying the trip!</p>

<p><label>Hermes</label> Still, just a groan or two. It’s expected.</p>

<p><label>Micyllus</label> Well, if I must, here goes.—Farewell, leather, farewell! Ah, Soles, old Soles!—Qh, ancient Boots!—Woe’s me! Never again shall I sit empty from morn till night; never again walk up and down, of a winter’s day, naked, unshod, with chattering teeth! My knife, my awl, will be another’s: whose, ah! whose?</p>

<p><label>Hermes</label> Yes, that will do. We are nearly there.

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="21">
<p><label>Charon</label> Wait a bit! Fares first, please. Your fare, Micyllus; every one else has paid; one penny.</p>

<p><label>Micyllus</label> You don’t expect to get a penny out of the poor cobbler?
You’re joking, Charon; or else this is what they call a ‘castle in the air.’ I know not whether your penny is square or round.</p>

<p><label>Charon</label> A fine paying trip this, I must say! However,—all ashore! I must fetch the horses, cows, dogs, and other livestock. Their turn comes now.</p>

<p><label>Clotho</label> You can take charge of them for the rest of the way, Hermes. I am crossing again to see after the Chinamen, Indopatres and Heramithres. They have been fighting about boundaries, and have killed one another by this time.</p>

<p><label>Micyllus</label> Bless me, how dark it is! Where is handsome Megillus now? There would be no telling Simmiche from Phryne.

Cyniscus, whereabouts are you?</p>

<p><label>Cynic</label> Use your ears; here I am. We might walk together. What do you say?

<p><label>Micyllus</label> Very good; give me your hand.—I suppose you have been admitted to the mysteries at Eleusis? That must have been something like this, I should think?</p>

<p><label>Cynic</label> Pretty much. Look, here comes a torch-bearer; a grim, forbidding dame. A Fury, perhaps?</p>

<p><label>Micyllus</label> She looks like it, certainly.

<p><label>Hermes</label> Here they are, Tisiphone. One thousand and four.</p>

<p><label>Cynic</label> Rhadamanthus, as you love your father Zeus, have me up first for examination.</p>

<p><label>Rhadamanthus</label> Why?</p>

<p><label>Cynic</label> There is a certain shade whose misdeeds on earth I am anxious to denounce. And if my evidence is to be worth anything, you must first be satisfied of my own character and conduct.</p>

<p><label>Rhadamanthus</label> Who are you?</p>

<p><label>Cynic</label> Cyniscus, your worship; a student of philosophy.</p>

<p><label>Rhadamanthus</label> Come up for judgement; I will take you first. Hermes, summon the accusers.

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="24">
<p><label>Hermes</label> If any one has an accusation to bring against Cyniscus here present, let him come forward.</p>

<p><label>Rhadamanthus</label> Ah, but that is not enough, my friend. Off with your clothes; I must have a look at your brands.</p>

<p><label>Cynic</label> Brands? Where will you find them?</p>

<p><label>Rhadamanthus</label> Never yet did mortal man sin, but he carried about the secret record thereof, branded on his soul.</p>

<p><label>Cynic</label> Well, here I am stripped. Now for the ‘brands.’</p>

<p><label>Rhadamanthus</label> Clean from head to heel, except three or four very faint marks, scarcely to be made out. Ah! what does this mean? Here is place after place that tells of the iron; all

rubbed out apparently, or cut out. How do you explain this, Cyniscus? How did you get such a clean skin again?</p>

<p><label>Cynic</label> Why, in old days, when I knew no better, I lived an evil life, and acquired thereby a number of brands. But from the day that I began to practise philosophy, little by little I washed out all the scars from my soul,—thanks to the efficiency of that admirable lotion.</p>

<p><label>Rhadamanthus</label> Off with you'then to the Isles of the Blest, and the excellent company you will find there. But we must have your impeachment of the tyrant before you go.—Next shade, Hermes!

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="25">
<p><label>Micyllus</label> Mine is a very small affair, too, Rhadamanthus; I shall not keep you long. I have been stripped all this time; so do take me next.</p>

<p><label>Rhadamanthus</label> And who may you be?</p>

<p><label>Micyllus</label> Micyllus the cobbler.</p>

<p><label>Rhadamanthus</label> Very well, Micyllus. As clean as clean could be; not a mark anywhere. You may join Cyniscus. Now the Tyrant.</p>

<p><label>Hermes</label> Megapenthes, son of Lacydes, wanted! Where are you off to? This way! You there, the Tyrant! Up with him, Tisiphone, neck and crop.</p>

<p><label>Rhadamanthus</label> Now, Cyniscus, your accusation and your proofs. Here is the party.

</p></div>


<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="26">
<p><label>Cynic</label> There is in fact no need of an accusation. You will very soon know the man by the marks upon him. My words however may serve to unveil him, and to show his character in a clearer light. With the conduct of this monster as a private citizen, I need not detain you. Surrounded with a bodyguard, and aided by unscrupulous accomplices, he rose against his native city, and established a lawless rule. The persons put to death by him without trial are to be counted by thousands, and it was the confiscation of their property that gave him his enormous wealth. Since then, there is no conceivable iniquity



<pb n="245"/>


which he has not perpetrated. His hapless fellow-citizens have been subjected to every form of cruelty and insult. Virgins have been seduced, boys corrupted, the feelings of his subjects outraged in every possible way. His overweening pride, his insolent bearing towards all who had to do with him, were such as no doom of yours can adequately requite. A man might with more security have fixed his gaze upon the blazing sun, than upon yonder tyrant. As for the refined cruelty of his punishments, it baffles description; and not even his familiars were exempt. That this accusation has not been brought without sufficient grounds, you may easily satisfy yourself, by summoning the murderer’s victims.—Nay, they need no summons; see, they are here; they press round as though they would stifle him. Every man there, Rhadamanthus, fell a prey to his iniquitous designs. Some had attracted his attention by the beauty of their wives; others by their resentment at the forcible abduction of their children; others by their wealth; others again by their understanding, their moderation, and their unvarying disapproval of his conduct.

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="27">
<p><label>Rhadamanthus</label> Villain, what have you to say to this?</p>

<p><label>Megapenthes.</label> I committed the murders referred to. As for the rest, the adulteries and corruptions and seductions, it is all a pack of lies.</p>

<p><label>Cynic</label> I can bring witnesses to these points too, Rhadamanghus.</p>

<p><label>Rhadamanthus</label> Witnesses, eh?</p>

<p><label>Cynic</label> Hermes, kindly summon his Lamp and Bed. They will appear in evidence, and state what they know of his conduct.</p>

<p><label>Hermes</label> Lamp and Bed of Megapenthes, come into court. Good, they respond to the summons,</p>

<p><label>Rhadamanthus</label> Now, tell us all you know about Megapenthes. Bed, you speak first.</p>

<p><label>Bed</label> All that Cyniscus said is true. But really, Mr. Rhadamanthus, I don’t quite like to speak about it; such strange things used to happen overhead.



<pb n="246"/></p>

<p><label>Rhadamanthus</label> Why, your unwillingness to speak is the most telling evidence of all!—Lamp, now let us have yours.;</p>

<p><label>Lamp</label> What went on in the daytime I never saw, not being there. As for his doings at night, the less said the better.
I saw some very queer things, though, monstrous queer. Many is the time I have stopped taking oil on purpose, and tried to goout. But then he used to bring me close up. It was enough to give any lamp a bad character.

<p><label>Rhadamanthus</label> Enough of verbal evidenee. Now, just divest yourself of that purple, and we will see what you have in the way of brands. Goodness gracious, the man’s a positive network!
Black and blue with them! Now, what punishment can we givehim? A bathin Pyriphlegethon? The tender mercies of Cerberus, perhaps?</p>

<p><label>Cynic</label> No, no. Allow me,—I have a novel idea; something that will just suit him.</p>

<p><label>Rhadamanthus</label> Yes? I shall be obliged to you for a suggestion.</p>
