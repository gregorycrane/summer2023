    <head>PREFACE.</head>

<p>The following translation contains nearly all of
Lucian’s more important and interesting dialogues.
The best of the “Dialogues of the Gods” and of the
“Dialogues of the Dead,” have been included, enough
to illustrate fully the character of these light and graceful productions, which have found not a few modern
imitators, The “Dialogues of the Dead” have been
grouped according to their leading characters, Diogenes,
Charon, etc. The Greek text chosen is that of Jacobitz,
and for convenience of reference the numbering of the
sections in the original Greek has been retained in the
translation.</p>

<p>It is the aim of the Introduction to give an account of
Lucian’s life and also of his times, so far as they
throw light upon his career, together with a brief résumé
of such of his writings as do not appear in these pages.
In preparing it, the admirable and appreciative essay
of M. Maurice Croiset' has been freely consulted.<ref n="1"/></p>

<p>Lucian abounds in mythological, archseological, literary, historical and biographical allusions. The
Notes are intended to supply such information as the
general reader, as well as the student of Greek, may
require, in order to understand them. Much of the
material of the Notes has been drawn from the standard
authorities upon classical biography and mythology.
And some valuable suggestions have been derived from
several of the current editions of selections in the
Greek for school use, especially from that of Professor
Charles R. Williams.</p>

<p>The translator has endeavored to reproduce the
precise thought of the original in clear, fluent,

idiomatic English, and at the same time to preserve,
so far as may be possible in passing from one
language into another, the genuine spirit and life, the
“bouquet” of Lucian himself. It isnot always the highest praise, to say of a translation, that it reads as if “to
the manner born,” with no suggestion of the language
from which it was made. A slight “brogue,” so to
speak, a dash now and then of the “foreign accent,”
adds, if anything, to its charm, bringing the reader
into closer touch with the author.</p>

<p>In his Essays and Studies the distinguished Greek
scholar, Dr, Basil L. Gildersleeve, says of our author:
<quote>Of all the Greek writers of the Empire Lucian presents the most fascinating problems to the student of
history. Not Plutarch, . . . not Antoninus, :
gives us half so much to think about, gives us half so
many glimpses of that world which lived such a varied
life, which moved under the impulse of such a complex of forces. . While Lucian is especially interesting to the Greek scholar, there are but few of his
pieces that are interesting only to the Greek scholar. ... There are not many ancient authors that retain for modern times so much of their essential oil.</quote>

<head>LUCIAN—THE MAN AND THE AUTHOR.</head>

<p>Among the literary men of the Second Century by far
the most striking figure is Lucian, of Samosata. Living in the post-classical period, when there were few
men of mark in the realm of letters, and obscured by
the monotonous mediocrity about him, he has received
much less attention than his intrinsic merits and his influence upon modern literature would warrant. His
writings more than those of any other author, reflect
with startling vividness the characteristic phases of the
social and intellectual life of that, in many respects,
memorable time; and such is their abounding wit and
humor and sparkling style, together with the temperament of the man himself, that he has been called the
Swift or Voltaire, the Rabelais or Heine of that day.
Singularly unlike every one of them, yet he has enough
in common with each, to suggest, if not to fully justify,
the comparison. He was a kindred spirit with Aristophanes, whose successor he was in the direct line of
literary descent; and no writer of antiquity has so distinctively a modern flavor and such a close affinity with
the spirit and temper of the life of to-day. With wide
knowledge and experience of the world, a shrewd and
penetrating observer, with a highly poetic nature and
fertile imagination, skillful in the delineation of character and of rare dramatic power, endowed with gifts
of wit and satire seldom equalled in literature with
which to smite the shams and follies of the day, and,
withal, a man of independence and courage, he would
have little difficulty in becoming naturalized in this
century. Here and now he would find as varied and
<pb n="p.10"/>

congenial a field for the exercise of his special talent;
for in many of its characteristic tendencies and types of
thought and life, the age in which he lived had much
in common with the present.</p>

<p>For several centuries after his death he seems to have
been ignored by pagan writers, who saw their own traditions day by day losing ground and naturally enough
entertained no friendly feeling toward one in whose
writings their adversaries had found an arsenal of
weapons. This may possibly account for the silence of
Philostratus in his Lives of the Sophists. As for the
representatives of Christianity, they could well avail
themselves of the ammunition he had put into their
hands; but one can readily understand why it was impossible for them to show any sympathy with his essential tendencies. In the middle ages Christianity, now
become the arbiter of pagan reputations, regarded him
with aversion as an Epicurean and an unbeliever who,
it was claimed, had spoken irreverently of the “faith.”
At the same time it approved the satirist who had turned
the Olympian gods into derision, and also accepted with
favor certain sentiments of the moralist, especially his
habit of estimating the good things of this life from the
point of view of death. In like manner the Byzantine
scholiasts, taking counsel of prejudice and misconception, rather than of fact, described him as an atheist, a
liar, anda blasphemer and even an apostate! from Christianity. They studied him, however, and sought to
profit by whatever excellences he seemed to them to possess. The imitations which have come down to us, of
some of his dialogues, attest how much his works were
at that time read and admired. It is, however, from
the Renaissance that the wider influence of Lucian
dates. It was then that he began to receivea juster and
more generous appreciation. The list isa long one of
those writers who during the fifteenth and sixteenth
centuries were indebted to him. Erasmus is worthy of
special mention. He not only translated into Latin a
number of Lucian’s writings, but, what is more, he
proved himself in his own works the heir of his spirit.

<note n="1"/> The charge that he was an apostate<ref n="1"/> Christian was based upon the Philopatris,
ad now recognized as not Lucian’s at all, but belonging to a much later

<pb n="p.11"/>


For the materials of his biography we have to depend
almost exclusively upon the incidental and scanty allusions contained in his own writings.<ref n="2"/> From these,
however, it is possible to determine the general outlines
of his life and with a good degree of accuracy what
manner of man he was.</p>

<p>The date of Lucian’s birth is uncertain, but probably
was not later than 125 a.p. There are some considerations which it is not necessary to enlarge upon here,
that are thought to indicate the year 120 as, perhaps,
the more likely date, unless we agree with M. Croiset
that the Hermotimus, written when Lucian was forty
years<ref n="3"/> old, was composed in 165. His death probably
took place about the year 200, so that his life very
nearly spanned that most remarkable period in the history of the Empire, the Age of the Antonines, covering
the reigns of Hadrian, the versatile cosmopolitan, the
unaffected, just and kindly Antoninus Pius, Marcus
Aurelius, the consummate flower of Stoic philosophy,
the cruel Commodus, and the earlier years of the
strong, but unscrupulous Septimius Severus.</p>

<p>Samosata, his native town, was a Syrian city of considerable size and strongly fortified, upon the western
bank of the upper Euphrates, and the ancient capital of
the kingdom of Commagené. It was in the midst of a
small, but rich district, and owed its importance to the
fact, that it commanded one of the principal passages
of the river and was, therefore a leading thoroughfare
for communication with Central Asia. Its ancient

<note n="2"/> Such ancient writéts as refer to him at all hardly more than mention his
name, with some of his writings. The work which passes under the name of
Suidas, but of a very much later date than Lucian, says he ‘was called a blasphemer or slanderer, because in his dialogues he maintains that the stories told
about the gods are ridiculous. He was born in the time of the Emperor Trajan,
or somewhat earlier. He was once an advocate in Antioch of Syria, but making
a failure of it, he turned his attention to writing speeches for others to deliver,
and composed no end of things. The story is that he was killed by dogs,
because he raged against the truth, for in his life of Peregrinus (See Appen
II.) he attacked Christianity and blasphemed the very Christ—blackguard that
he was. Therefore also for his fury he paid penalties sate ange © present
world; and in the world to come he will be heir of everlasting fire with Satan.”
The few glimpses we have of his early history are given in the Dream, which
probably served as an introduction to a course of Tpedings before his fellowtownsmeniof Samosata, whither he had returned, when about forty years of
age, after a long sojourn in foreign lands.

name survives in the modern Sempsat, or Samisat.
While its population remained essentially Syrian, it no
doubt was powerfully affected by the wave of Greek influence which was set in motion toward the east in the
latter half of the fourth century B.c. by the conquests of
Alexander the Great, and which under the Seleucidae,
kings of Antioch, to whom Samosata was long tributary, continued to rise higher and higher, until Syria
had become substantially Hellenized, even before it fell
under Roman rule. Commagené was made a province
of the Empire in the year 18 B.c. and remained such
until a.D. 38, when Caligula restored it to Antiochus
Epiphanes, a prince of the ancient royal family, who
was, however, deposed by Vespasian in 72, from which
time the district was governed as a Roman province.
Samosata was long garrisoned by a legion of Syrian
troops as an outpost against the Parthians. Its people
were of the same stock as the Phoenicians and Hebrews,
and it was one of the few towns that retained their
native names after the Macedonian domination had
become fully established. The native religious cultus
had not been superseded by the Greek, but outwardly
at least had become assimilated to it, adopting side by
side with its own the corresponding names of the Greek
deities. Like hiscountrymen in general, Lucian seems
never to have been ashamed of his Syrian birth. He
mentions it several times<ref n="4"/> and apparently with considerable self-satisfaction. For his self-love was flattered,
as he reflected upon the contrast between the culture and
distinction he attained in his later years and his humble
origin in remote Samosata, among a people who had
never cultivated in any true sense science, art, or philosophy even in their chief city of Antioch, and who in all
the centuries of Greek influence had never furnished
another so notable a name in Greek literature. Syrians
were everywhere throughout the Roman Empire, but
they were known as jockeys and actors, flute players,
street musicians and ballet dancers, wrestlers and boxers, buffoons and jugglers.</p>

<p>Less than two hundred miles from the populous, busy,

<pb n="p.13"/>

splendid and luxurious Antioch and on the highway between Asia Minor and the Hast, Lucian’s native town
was affected, at least in the larger outlines of its life,
by the intellectual activity that prevailed in the cities of
fonia. The Greek schoolmaster was no stranger in
Samosata; and doubtless the usual school privileges
found in the larger towns to the westward were to be
had there, furnishing the youth with a knowledge of
reading, writing, and counting, and including something mmar and literature, music and gymnastics,
geography, drawing, and geometry.</p>

<p>Lucian’s parents were worthy working people of
small means, fairly intelligent and of good common
sense, with the honorable ambition to bring up their son
to some regular employment by which he could gain an
honest living. His mother was daughter of a statuary
and had two brothers who followed the same calling.
Lucian was sent to school, probably at quite an early
age, and continued there until his sixteenth or seventeenth year. From a study of his manhood, coupled
with one or two facts we know of his early years, we
may reasonably infer that he was neither a dull, nor a
precocious scholar, but a genuine, healthy boy of exuberant life, spinning his top, playing ball or other games
with the best of them, a leader among his fellows, an
honest, thoughtful, manly boy, quick-witted, enterprising and persevering, with a dash of playful mischief
and a mind of his own, and not always occupied with
the studies of the school curriculum. Lucian himself
gives us one incident of his school days, which, trifling
though it was, throws some light upon them and, as we
shall see, came very near shaping his future career.
He tells us that when the daily school session was over
he used to amuse himself, notwithstanding the beating
he got for it from his teachers, with scraping off the
wax from his writing tablets and skillfully fashioning
it into cattle, horses, and even men.</p>

<p>In these early years he obtained a fair knowledge of
the Greek language, corrupted indeed into a provincial
patois by contact with the native Syrian, but the basis
of the skill and grace with which he came to use it afterward; and no doubt the seed was then sown, which.
<pb n="p.14"/>

under the culture of later life and more favorable surroundings, ripened into that wide familiarity with the
masterpieces of Greek literature which his works illustrate.</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="2">

<p>HIS APPRENTICESHIP AS A STATUARY.</p>

<p>But at last his school days were over, and the same
grave problem that so often puzzles modern parents,
forced itself upon the father and mother of this bright,
active, aspiring youth—what should they put him to?
In their perplexity they took counsel with their family
friends. He had been kept in school longer probably
than was usual with the youth of Samosata, and at this
gathering it was suggested that he be given a liberal education. But most of those present regarded this as out
of the question. It would require too much time and an
expense far beyond his parents’ means. Moreover, the
self-reliant youth seems to have had some notions himself
about the matter. If he should master a trade, he
would probably be able to get his living out of it and
thus be no longer dependent upon his parents, and he
could gladden their hearts by repaying them from his
wages. Then as one and another suggested some employment for consideration, the father bethought himself of his son’s penchant for moulding wax figures, of
which he reminded the company; and turning to one of
the uncles of the boy, a stone mason and Hermae-carver<ref n="5"/> of some reputation, he said to him: “It isn’t
right that he should learn any other trade. So take the
youth under your care and train him to be a good workman in stone and in carving statues.”? All agreed that
this was the thing to be done and expressed their confident anticipations of the boy’s ultimate success.</p>

<p>Accordingly on the appointed day Lucian began work
in his uncle’s shop, well-pleased on the whole at the
turn affairs had taken, for now he would have an opportunity to show off before his mates, as they watched
him with envious eyes, while he carved gods and made

<note n="5"/> Hermae consisted of a head, usually that of Hermes, resing upon a quadrangular pedestal, the total height being about that of a man. They were used
to mark boundaries and were set up before houses, temples and tombs and in
gymnasia, palsostree, libraries and porticoes, also at the corners of streets and on the high roads as sign posts, with distances inscribed upon them and sometimes moral verses.

statuettes. But his elation was short-lived, for his very
first lesson shattered the hopes of both himself and his
friends, though in after years he must have regarded its
issue as almost a prophecy of what was to be his future
career. His uncle, placing a chisel in his hand, set him
at work upon a slab of marble, with the caution to be
careful about striking it too hard, encouraging him with
the old saw, “Well begun is half-done,’? which has
seen service since, at least, the days of Hesiod. From
lack of skill, or in his youthful impetuosity he brought
the chisel down too hard; and alas! the slab was
broken. His uncle flew into a passion at the clumsiness of his apprentice, and seizing a stick which happened to be conveniently near, initiated him into his
art, as Lucian says, in no gentle or persuasive fashion.
His illusion thus rudely dispelled, the boy dropped his
chisel and ran home crying, to his mother’s protecting
aegis. Into her sympathizing ears he poured the story
of the treatment he had received and showed her his
bruises, protesting that it was all owing to his uncle’s
jealousy of his promising talents. His mother naturally
took the affair greatly to heart and bitterly upbraided
her brother for his harshness. That night the highspirited youth sobbed himself into a troubled sleep,
anon awaking to brood over what had happened. As
he slept, a wonderful vision, he tells us, came to him,
which made such a vivid impression upon his mind,
that he professes to have remembered it more than
twenty years later in the minutest particulars, for it
marked the turning point in his life. Jt is not improbable that he really did have a vision, in some of its
essential features the same, though not so highly
colored, as he afterward described it to the wondering
listeners of Samosata. For we must remember that he
lived in an age of dreams and was himself endowed
with much of the lively imagination of his native
orient, which, wrought upon by the excitement of beginning his new work and by the tragic events of the
day, not unnaturally conjured up before his mind the
‘baseless fabric of a vision.” It is fairtoassume from
the qualities of character and mind shown in his later
career, that as he approached manhood he had not
<pb n="p.16"/>

looked forward with unmixed satisfaction to spending
his days in Samosata in the irksome, monotonous round
of some mechanical trade. Glimpses had come to him
of that outer world to the westward, full of movement
and intellectual activity in philosophy and the rhetorical art. Occasionally the sophists and rhetoricians in
their travels had visited his native town to give their
courses of lectures, just as he himself did many years
afterward, and perhaps had drawn around them some
of the youth of his own acquaintance. All this no
doubt had awakened within him vague impulses and
aspirations for something better, which only failed to
take definite form because of the poverty of his home,
and had been cheerfully put aside in obedience to his
parents’ wishes. The sudden and tragic issue of hig
first attempt at learning a trade now forced these old=..
time yearnings more distinctly upon his attention, and
he could not endure to go back again into his uncle’s
studio. Thus the precise conditions were at hand,
which might naturally be expected to supply the basis
for such a vision as he describes.</p>
</div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="3">

<p>THE DREAM.</p>

<p>Two women seized hold of him by his hands, each
striving with might and main to get possession of him,
so that in their mutual rivalry he was almost torn
asunder; and meanwhile they angrily disputed each
other’s claims. The one was a muscular, masculine
looking woman, the “horny-handed” daughter of toil,
her hair unkempt and slovenly, her dress suited to her,
occupation; and she was covered with the dust and dirt
of the atelier, like his uncle, when polishing the
marbles. But the other was beautiful to look upon, of
handsome figure and tastefully and elegantly dressed.
At last, wearied out, each makes her appeal to the youth
himself to decide with which he would cast in his lot,
The masculine one speaks first :<ref n="6"/>

“'I, my dear child, am the Art of Sculpture, which
yesterday you began to learn—a near friend of yours,
and also one of your own kith and kin on your mother’s
side. For your grandfather’—speaking the name of

<pb n="p.17"/>

my mother’s father—‘was a marble-mason, and your
two uncles are both very famous through me. If you
are willing to eschew the stuff and nonsense which proceed from this one’—pointing to the other—‘and to be
my companion and dwell with me, first of all you will
grow up manly and have the shoulders of an athlete,
and you will not be exposed to any jealousy and will
never leave your own country and kin and go away to
a foreign land, nor will all applaud you for mere words.
Don’t be disgusted at the shabbiness of my looks or the
squalor of my dress. For it was with no better start
than this that the famous Phidias<ref n="7"/> came to portray
Zeus to the life and Polyclitus executed his statue of
Hera and Myron won golden opinions and Praxiteles
was:admired. Indeed, these men are reverenced along
with their gods. If now you should become one of
them, you will assuredly be thought famous yourself
among all men; you will make your father, too, an
object of envy and render your country also the admiration of all beholders.’ This and yet more Sculpture
said, stuttering much and speaking gibberish for the
most part, stringing her words together with great
urgency and trying hard to win me over. But Ino
longer remember it, for the most that she said at once
escaped my memory.</p>

<p>When, however, she finished speaking, the other
began substantially as follows:<ref n="8"/>

full proof of me. This woman has stated in advance

<note n="7"/> Phidias: (490-432 B.C.) The most celebrated of Greek sculptors. His masterpiece, perhaps, was the statue of Zeus, referred to in the text, executed in
gold and ivory for the temple at Olympia. The god was represented as seated
upon a magnificent throne; his head bore a wreath of olive; in his right hand he
held a statue of victory, in his left a sceptre surmounted by an eagle. Including
the pedestal the statue was over fifty feet high. Polyclitus (452-412 B. C.) was
a famous statuary in both bronze and marble. The statue of Hera, wife of Zeus,
referred to in the text, was made in gold and ivory for a temple of hers near
Argos. Myron (born about 480 B. C.), an artist in bronze, was especially famous
for animal pieces, of which the “Cow” was the most celebrated. A work of
higher art was his Discobolus, or quoit-thrower. Praxiteles (about 390 B. C.)
especially excelled in representing the softer beauties and graces of the human

a workman, toiling with your body and having invested
in this toil absolutely all your life’s hope, obscure yourself, receiving small and mean wages, dejected in mind
and making a sorry show when you appear in public,
neither much sought after by friends, nor feared by
enemies, nor an object of envy to your fellow-citizens,
but a mere workman and nothing more, one of the common herd, all your life long cowering before your
superior and paying court to him who can talk, leading
a hare’s life, and a prize for every one stronger than
yourself. But suppose you should become even a
Phidias or a Polyclitus and should execute many admirable works, all will praise your skill, but not one of
those who look on, if he is in his senses, would wish to
become like you. However good asculptor you may

as one who lives by the work of his hands.</p>

<p>“But if you obey me, I will in the first place show
you many things that men of old have wrought; I will
relate their wonderful.doings and sayings and make
you acquainted with almost everything; and your soul
—that which is the supreme element of your being—I
will adorn with many goodly ornaments, with selfcontrol, righteousness, piety and gentleness, with sweet
reasonableness, mother-wit, and patient endurance, and
with the love of the beautiful and the impulse toward
what is most noble. For these qualities are in very
truth the soul’s chaste adorning. Nothing pertaining

wealth. You will wear such clothing as I do’-—with
this she pointed to her own apparel, for she was dressed
with very great elegance—‘and you will be thought

you for relief. Should you chance somewhere to say
something, the multitude will listen with open mouths,
admiring and congratulating you for your ability as a
speaker and your father on account of his prodigy of a
son. The common saying that some forsooth are made

every way abject, never lifting up your head or having
any thought worthy of aman or of afreeman. Nay,

“While she was still talking in this strain, I rose up
without awaiting the conclusion of her appeal, and
made known my decision; and forsaking yonder begrimed workwoman, I cast in my lot with Culture
very joyfully, especially as the cudgel came into my
mind and the thought that yesterday at the very beginning the former had caused not a few blows to be given
me. But she who had been abandoned, in the first
place was angry, smote her hands together and gnashed
her teeth, and at last, just as we hear was Niobe’s<ref n="13"/>
fate, she became rigid and turned into stone. Well, if
she did have an improbable experience, don’t be incredulous, for wonder-working is characteristic of dreams.</p>

<p>“But the other woman looked at me and said: ‘Rest
assured I shall reward you for this decision, because
you have decided the matter rightly. Come, then, at
once! Mount upon this chariot’—pointing to a sort of
car which had a kind of winged coursers like unto the
Pegasus—‘in order that you may see what great things
you were sure to remain ignorant of, had you not followed me.’

<note n="13"/> Niobe, wife of Amphion, king of Thebes, was so proud of her seven sons
and as many daughters that she presumed to regard herself as superior to Leto,
who had only two, Apollo and Artemis, and forbade the Thebans to sacrifice to
Leto. This so angered Apollo and Artemis that they slew them all. In her grief
Niobe returned home to her father, Tantalus, king of Lydia. Here on Mount
Sipylus the gods changed her into a stone, whihc always in summer-time shed

tears. The legend was a favorite subject in art, e.g., the famous Niobe in
the gallery of the Uffizi in Florence.

<p>“When I had mounted, she held the reins and drove;
and ascending on high, I began with the east and from
there as far as the extreme west took a survey of cities,
nations, and hamlets, while I sowed something upon the
earth exactly as Triptolemus<ref n="14"/> did. Just now, though,
Ido not remember what it was that I scattered, but this
circumstance only, that the men above whom I chanced
to soar kept applauding, as they looked up from below,
and attended me on my way with words of good augury.
My companion, after showing me so many things and
pointing me out to those who saluted us with their acclamations, conducted me back again, no longer clad in
that dress, which I had when I started on my aérial
voyage, but I fancied I was returning home something
of a grandee. Then, too, when she met with my father
who stood awaiting us, she showed him that beautiful
costume and in what glory I had come back, and also
gave him a gentle reminder of the plans concerning me
which he came within an ace of consummating. I remember having seen these things when I was but just
past boyhood, greatly troubled in mind, I imagined,
because of the fear excited by the flogging.”</p>

<p>In this graphic description, stripped of its poetic garb,
we can discover that there was a critical moment in
Lucian’s early life, when like Heracles in the famous
Choice<ref n="15"/> described by Prodicus, he stood at the parting of
two ways and must choose either to walk in the humble
path which his ancestors had trod for generations, or
yield to those inner promptings, which told him there
was something, though as yet he knew not what it was,
higher and better for him to do in the world, than turning out Herme all his days in a little shop on a narrow, dirty lane of Samosata.</p>

<p>A STUDENT OF RHETORIC IN IONIA.</p>

<p>The next day after this night of dreaming we may be
sure he did not return to his apprenticeship. He had

<note n="15"/> The Choice of Heracles: See Appendix I. No doubt Lucian modelled the

<pb n="p.22"/>

made up his mind to that, and doubtless his mother
sustained him in it. Unfortunately he has not told us
what was the immediate sequel to the affair. But it is
quite unlikely that he left home at once on those travels,
which occupied most of the succeeding twenty or
twenty-five years. Probably he remained for awhile
longer in Samosata, either waiting for something to
turn up, or going back for a season to his studies, possibly under the brief tuition of some traveling sophist
or rhetorician, who, finding him a capable pupil, may
have fired the imagination of the youth by stories of the
attractions and opportunities of the cities of Ionia.
When next we hear of him he is wandering from
place to place in western Asia Minor, intent upon fitting
himself to be a rhetorician.<ref n="16"/>  How he obtained the
means to do this he doesnot tell us. But from the poverty of his parents he had to depend upon himself and
hence must have had a hard struggle, from which, however, he did not flinch. A mere stripling less than
twenty years of age, he sets forth from home to win his
way in the world, staff in hand—for he must travel
mainly on foot—clad in a coarse Median doublet after
the Syrian fashion and betraying his origin by the
mongrel provincial dialect of his native district, but
with a certain natural buoyancy of spirits, though he
was ignorant of what the future had in store for him.
For several years he roamed from place to place, gaining a somewhat precarious livelihood. and meanwhile
preparing himself for the profession of ‘rhetor,’ which
he may perhaps have definitely decided upon before
leaving home, but more likely after he came to breathe
the more stimulating intellectual atmosphere of the
great Ionian cities. Here rhetoric, at that time the
equivalent of our higher, or liberal, education, was sedulously cultivated at all the great centers, especially at
Smyrna, Ephesus, and Pergamus, whither Scopelianus,
Polemon, Aristocles, Aristides and others of almost
equal celebrity attracted disciples from all over Asia
Minor, Pheenicia, and even from Egypt. To use the

<note n="16"/> The Double Indictment, 27.
<pb n="p.23"/>

expression of Philostratus,<ref n="17"/>  all Ionia was a kind of grand
philosophical or rhetorical school, so universal was the
enthusiasm for these studies. The very air was full of
them; and no wonder that Lucian, ardent, imaginative,
ambitious, conscious in some measure of his own powers
and attracted by the emoluments of fame and fortune
which such a career offered, gave himself up to the profession of rhetoric with a singleness of devotion, which
he is fond of representing in the guise of a lover’s passion for his betrothed. “He bowed down to her; to her
he paid court, and she was the sole object of his worship.”<ref n="18"/>  It is scarcely probable that Lucian was a pupil of
the more distinguished teachers like those mentioned
above, else he would have given us some intimation of
the fact. He was too poor to pay the large fees that they
exacted, and so he had to content himself with instructors
of less repute. Aside from the technique of the art and the
practice which he received under their direction, he was
probably more indebted for his education to his own individual efforts and to his close study of the accepted
models of classic style. Whatever guidance he received, be it little or much, seems to have developed in
a natural way what was in the young man himself.</p>

<p>The passion for public speaking was even more common then than now. It was an age of declamation and
endless talk; and the primary purpose of a liberal education was to qualify a person to plead in the courts,
write orations for others to deliver, pronounce show discourses, or to be a professional lecturer or teacher from
the platform. Rhetorical masters were everywhere,
some of them no doubt of well-deserved distinction, but
the most, encouraging by their instructions the superficial, sensational, and affected style of discourse common
in that age.</p>

<p>We may picture Lucian as diligently occupied for the
next few years in the study of the Greek language and
literature, reading Homer and the other poets, and
Demosthenes and the orators, listening to his teacher’s
illustrations and explanations of them and practicing

the technical methods of oral and written expression.
And incidentally he is storing his retentive memory
with much of the material of discourse, with history
and myth and literary allusion, and with a smattering
perhaps of ethics and philosophy. At this time also he
must have made some study of jurisprudence with a
view to becoming an advocate, though the statement
of Suidas, that he practiced law in Antioch, is perhaps
better referred toa later period of his life. As a net
result of his education thus far, he had acquired a fairly
cultivated literary taste and a good degree of skill in
the use of his adopted language and was now enrolled
in the guild of rhetors and advocates, Meanwhile he
had supported himself as best he could by the scanty
earnings of such menial employments as offered themselves. He was recognized as an unusually clever and
diligent pupil and may have had the benefit of the gifts
which rich scholars in those days often gave to the
sophists, as in the case of Aristides and Adrianus, that
their lectures might be made free to the poorer students.</p>
</div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="5">
<p>VISITS ATHENS AND OTHER PARTS OF GREECE.</p>

<p>He tried his ’prentice hand for a brief season as
traveling lecturer, advocate, and especially as a writer
of speeches for others, first in Ionia, with sufficient success, it would seem, to give him some reputation and
the means with which to realize his cherished desire to
visit Greece. He tarried for some time in Athens, then
the chief seat of university learning in the Empire, perfecting himself especially in the Greek language at its
very source and center, and pursuing further studies in
literature, at the same time becoming imbued with the
intellectual freedom and mobility which gave tone to
the society of the place. In the exercise of his art he
made excursions into various parts of Greece and for
the first time was present at the Olympic games, perhaps the celebration of the year 145 A.D.

‘While in Athens he came into close contact with the
philosophy of the day and no doubt gave the subject at
least a superficial attention. Here he made the acquaintance of Nigrinus, a Platonist, with whom he
afterward renewed his friendship in Rome, whither he
<pb n="p.25"/>

went, when about twenty-five years of age, to consult
an oculist for an affection of the eyes, which had been
steadily growing worse.<ref n="19"/> Nigrinus, according to
Lucian’s testimony, appears to have been a man of
singular attractiveness, as good as he was eloquent,
who agreeably tempered the severity of his doctrines
with a certain sweetness of character and sprightliness
of spirit. It would seem that about this time Lucian
was strongly drawn toward the teachings of philosophy,
indeed came very near being converted to them.<ref n="20"/> In
the “Hermotimus,” which professes to be a dialogue
had with a Stoic philosopher when Lucian was about
forty years of age,<ref n="21"/> he relates that about fifteen years
before<ref n="22"/> a certain old man once and again discoursed to
him of a blessed city whose inhabitants were altogether
happy and of consummate wisdom, brave, just, and selfcontrolled, indeed hardly less than gods. He told him
how things went on there. Nothing of the robbery,
violence, and greed, so prevalent here, would he see
there; but all its citizens live together in peace and
harmony, free from all such things as gold, sensual
pleasures, and ambition for glory, which breed strifes
and eager rivalries, and leading a calm and perfectly
happy life under good laws, with equality and freedom
and all other blessings. The aged sage exhorted his
youthful hearer to follow him hither, declaring that
“the would himself lead the way and enroll him as a
citizen upon his arrival, make him a member of his
own tribe, and share with him the privileges of his
brotherhood, that he might enjoy the common happiness.”</p>

<p>It requires no stretch of the imagination to believe
that this old man was none other than Nigrinus, whose
amiable qualities, grace, and force of speech, sincerity,
disinterestedness, elevation of thought and serenity of
spirit appealed so powerfully at this time to Lucian’s
impressionable nature, that he was almost persuaded to
renounce the hopes and ambitions which he had cher-

ished hitherto. "When the philosopher ceased, his listener, under the spell of his words, continued for some
time to gaze fixedly upon him. “His mind,” he tells
us, “was confused and distracted; his brain reeled; he
was in a profuse sweat; be wished to speak, but could
only stammer, and stopped short; his voice failed him;
his tongue refused to articulate, and finally in utter perplexity he burst into tears.<ref n="23"/>

The effect was too sudden and overwhelming to be
permanent. A revulsion of feeling was sure to follow
when he came to consider what a radical change in his
purposes and plans of life was involved. He had been
carried away by the enthusiasm of the moment, but not
actually convinced. Young and full of anticipation for
the future and encouraged by the success he had already
won, he could not bring himself to resign the advantages which his profession promised him. Of this
episode in his life Lucian years afterward said regretfully: “In my youthful folly—for it was about fifteen
years ago—I did not obey him, else already I might be
in the very suburbs of the city, yea, at its gates.”<ref n="24"/></p>

<p>Having accomplished the errand which had brought
him to Rome, he returned to Greece, but only for a season. He again was present at the Olympic games—
perhaps in the year 149 A.D.—which seem to have had a
peculiar attraction for him, furnishing in the multitude
of people gathered there an unusual opportunity to observe human life, of which Lucian was always an interested and acute spectator, and for the sophists and
rhetors to ply their trade. It was characteristic of the
craft to travel from place to place. The very nature of
their business demanded it. For the masses of the people their lectures took the place of books and of the
modern newspaper, ministering to the universal passion
of the time, to see and hear some new thing. Asia
Minor set the fashion for the Empire, and the most eminent sophists and rhetors of Rome and the West were
either natives of Lesser Asia, or had obtained their professional education in her schools. Like the rest of
them Lucian drifted westward, as the place which promised the largest rewards in fame and fortune.

<p>HIS SOJOURN IN ITALY AND GAUL.</p>

<p>Soon after his last mentioned visit at Olympia, he
crossed the Ionian sea to Rome.<ref n="25"/> Here and in other
parts of Italy he is believed to have spent several years.
The satire which he afterward wrote Concerning
Salaried Companions, in which he graphically portrays the trials of a literary dependent in the family of
a wealthy Roman, shows such an intimate acquaintance
with life in Rome as could only have been gained during a somewhat prolonged residence.</p>

<p>It is not necessary to suppose with some, that, having
had a taste of the bondage himself, he wrote out of the
fullness of his own experience. He was of too independent a spirit to submit to its degrading conditions, except under the direst necessity, and that necessity, he
tells us, never came to him.<ref n="26"/> The Romans seem never
to have stirred within him any sympathetic interest,
The Mgrimus is for the most part a satire upon their
vices and a contrast between the pomp and turmoil of
life in Rome and the delightful repose and peace to be
enjoyed at Athens. And in Salarved Companions he
vividly describes the wealthy class as “brilliant upon
the outside and admired of all observers, but within,
beneath the purple, covering up ever so much tragedy,
out of which some Euripides or Sophocles could find
abundant material for a drama.”<ref n="27"/></p>

<p>A passage in his Excuse apropos of an Inadvertence
in Salutation<ref n="28"/>  seems to warrant the conclusion, that he
was acquainted to some extent with Latin. It is quite
probable that he was familiar with the works of
Horace,<ref n="29"/> a man of congenial spirit; and he may have
been better versed in Latin literature in general than
he, as an adopted Greek, was willing to acknowledge.</p>

<p>Of his life in Italy he gives us only one glimpse
which indicates that he traveled in Cisalpine Gaul, perhaps when on his way to the Gaul beyond the Alps, delivering lectures in the great cities as he proceeded.

<pb n="p.28"/>

<p>He facetiously tells how years before<ref n="30"/> —probably in his
boyhood days at Samosata—he had heard the familiar
story of Phaethon, the presumptuous son of Helios, and
of his sister’s sad fate; and how he himself had then
resolved, that, if he should ever visit northern Italy,
he would make it a point to test the truth of the story.
He goes on to say, that having gone there for another
purpose—no doubt a professional one—he took the opportunity to make inquiry; but the natives had never
even heard of Phaethon, and when, with mock credulity, he asked the boatmen as he sailed up the Po, when
they would get to the poplars and the amber, they
laughed and demanded to know what he meant. When
he had related the story, how Phaethon, losing control
of his father’s chariot, permitted it to approach too near
the earth, for which Zeus smote him with a flash of
lightning and he fell into the river Po, while his sisters
for their part in yoking the steeds to the chariot were
changed into black poplars and their tears into amber,
which ever afterward distilled from the leaves—the
boatmen asked him “what deceiver and liar had told
him that yarn and assured him that they had never
seen any charioteer fall into the river, and as for the
poplars he told about, they knew of none such.”</p>

<p>After a sojourn of several years in Italy, Lucian
turned his steps to southern Gaul, where he was to win
his greatest triumphs in what may be termed the rhetorical period of his career. Like Ionia Gaul was a
paradise for the sophist and rhetor. Hellenism was
the dominant element in the culture of the province, as
might have been expected from the closer affinity of the
Gallic with the Greek mind than with the Roman.
The Gauls, like the Greeks, were of a sanguine, galvanic
temperament, alert and quick-witted, fond of display
and much given to a diffuse, ornate style of diction.
Nowhere had the rhetorical art, as it was then practiced, found a more congenial soil. Gaul was at that
time the wealthiest province of the Empire, and the
most famous seats of rhetoric and her handmaid, law, in
the west were at Lyons, Marseilles, Arles and Toulouse, whither the most eminent professors of the day

<note n="30"/> Concerning Amber or Swans, 1 ff.
<pb n="p.29"/>

were attracted by the offer of large emoluments. Some
of these schools were aided by subventions from the imperial government. Lucian was well fitted by nature
and attainments to succeed in such a field, and his success during his sojourn there is attested by the fact that
he received a very large public salary<ref n="31"/>  as a professional
sophist or rhetor and was among the best paid of them
all. He is thought to have spent ten years in Gaul,<ref n="32"/>
during a large part of the time as professor of rhetoric
and law at some one of the great schools mentioned
above, perhaps at Lyons, which, according to Eusebius
and Irenzeus, was especially famous at thattime. In
his works, however, there is a singular dearth of references to his life among the Gauls and nothing to indicate what place was the principal seat of his professional labors. The sole reminiscence of his residence
there to be found in his writings is contained in the description of the god Ogmius, whom he identifies with
the Greek Heracles.<ref n="33"/> </p>
</div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="7">

<p>REVISITS SAMOSATA.</p>

<p>In Gaul Lucian maintained the attitude of a foreigner, devoting himself assiduously to his profession,
winning applause and fortune, and that accomplished,
glad to turn his face homeward. An accurate transcript of his own feelings at this time may be found in
his Eulogium upon the Fatherland.<ref n="34"/>  “No one,” he
says, “is so unmindful of his native land, as to take no
thought of her, when he is in a foreign city. Nay, even
those who fare ill in foreign parts unceasingly declare,
that their fatherland is the greatest of all blessings;
while the prospered, even when they fare well in every
other particular, regard it as their greatest deficiency,
that they are away from home, living in a strange land.

<note n="31"/> The Apology. 15.
<note n="32"/> Some suppose that his sojourn in Gaul was interrupted by a visit to the
Olympic games in 157. This seems quite unlikely, otherwise there would besome

intimation of the fact. The supposition rests upon the statement in Peregrinus 35—according to which Lucian attended the Olympic games on four occasions,
<foreign>τετράκις ἤδη ὁρῶν</foreign>

three of them before the death of Peregrinus, which, on the authority of
Eusebius. has been assigned to 165. Perhaps, however, the announcement of
his future self-immolation should be placed in that year, but the event itself in 169. This is the view of M. Croiset.
<note n="33"/> The Heracles. 
<note n="34"/> The Eulogium on the Fatherland, 8.

<pb n="p.30"/>

For it is a reproach to live abroad. And they who during their absence have won renown, either on account
of the acquisition of wealth, or the honorable reputation
they have obtained, or because of their proved culture,
or of their acknowledged valor—all such make haste to
return to the fatherland, in order to exhibit their own
fine accomplishments, where there are none to surpass
them; and the greater the estimation he seems to have
obtained with strangers, the more urgent is each one to
reach his native country.”</p>

<p>It is unlikely that Lucian had ever revisited Samosata
since his departure, when a mere stripling, having determined not to return until he had realized his ambitions. He was now possessed of a competency and his
reputation was firmly established. It is not known precisely by what route he journeyed from Gaul to the
East,<ref n="35"/> but he arrived in lonia about the year 161 A.D.
where he found the pamphleteers<ref n="36"/> of Ephesus and
Smyrna discussing the Parthian war, which was then
in progress upon the eastern frontier of the Empire.
He was next in Antioch, whither Lucius Verus. the
colleague of Marcus Aurelius, had come to take command of the Roman forces. Here he delayed a while,
until the issue of the campaign upon the Euphrates was
clear, in the meantime, perhaps, doing some work as an
advocate,<ref n="37"/> and amusing himself with writing the Portraits and a Defense of the same, in the extravagant
language of which he is supposed to describe the beautiful concubine of the Roman commander, who preferred to linger among the charms of the Syrian capital,
rather than take the field in person against the enemy.</p>

<p>The year 163 finds Lucian at his old home, no doubt
the object of wondering interest to his fellow-townsmen
who saw him, whom they remembered only as an
awkward, undisciplined youth, now transformed by
study and experience of the world into an accomplished
man of letters. Of course he was called upon to exhibit

his powers, which he was nothing loath to do, and gave
a series of lectures or readings, prefaced by the Dream,
in which he at once glorified his own successes and
sought to stir the ambition of the young men of Samosata.</p>
</div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="8">
<p>HE DETERMINES TO SETTLE IN ATHENS.</p>

<p>But Lucian could not be content to remain long in
that Syrian town. There was nothing to detain him
there, or to draw him hither again, except that it was the
home of his parents, for whom he seems to have entertained a truly filial regard. No doubt he had already
determined to settle in Athens, which of all the places
he had visited offered him the most attractions. There
the imperial authority was least obtrusive. The spirit
of the place was hostile to the luxury and ostentation
that prevailed in Rome and Gaul, and imposed a salutary restraint upon any who came hither inclined toa
life of luxurious indulgence and display.<ref n="38"/>  The noise
and bustle of the great metropolis were wanting. A
kindly frankness characterized the manners of the people. Hach lived as he pleased, respecting the liberty of
others and undisturbed by their opinions. Each enjoyed
a learned leisure, adorned with the taste for letters and
art. Nowhere else in the Empire was there allowed so
much of freedom in thought and speech. This calm
and independence of life were especially agreeable to a
man of Lucian’s type. His own literary instincts were
in accord with the moral and intellectual temperament
of its people. They possessed a fineness of the critical
sense which led the most distinguished litterateurs of
the time to render homage to their authority by soliciting their suffrages. They were qualified by their native
sprightliness and mobility of mind, to appreciate what
was brilliant and clever, and at once to perceive the
ridiculous. No doubt Athens was much the same in
Lucian’s time, as when the Apostle Paul visited it a
few scores of years before. There was the same spirit
of curious inquiry, the same eagerness to hear and tell
some new thing, the same expectant welcome for the
stranger who brought with him some item of news from

the outside world, or could tickle their fancy with the
latest bon-mot or give them some fresh conceit in philosophy to debate. Lucian’s coming hither marks the
beginning of that period in his life which possesses the
most interest for us; for while we may not attribute to
the atmosphere of the place the great change which at
this time came over him, no doubt his surroundings
there had much to do with the later development of his
genius.</p>

<p>HIS ADVENTURE WITH ALEXANDER.</p>

<p>He probably left Samosata in the year 164, taking
with him his father and the other members of the family. The direct route lay through Cappadocia, from
which he turned aside to visit Abonotichos, a town in
Paphlagonia on the Euxine, that he might see for himself the notorious hierophant and soothsayer, Alexander,
whose brazen impudence and successful imposture
crown him as the most extraordinary product, the very
Cagliostro, of that superstitious age. According to
Lucian’s story,<ref n="39"/> being at a loss for the means of living,
Alexander pretended to have discovered some bronze
tablets, which foretold the early coming of Asclepius
to Pontus. The god arrived in the form of a serpent—
his well-known emblem—which the wily deceiver had
placed in a goose egg, from which it was made to come
forth at the opportune moment. With this serpent,
which he called Glycon, as his chief stock in trade, to
represent the younger Asclepius, he set up an oracle at
Abonotichos, claiming that he was himself the gon of
Perseus. By means of his juggling tricks and magic
arts he succeeded so well in playing upon the credulity
of the populace, that his fame extended far and wide,
even into Italy. The higher classes in Rome became
affected with the craze; some sent their servants to consult the oracle and some went themselves in their eager
haste to get the start of one another. Even a Roman
senator, a certain Rutilianus, dispatched deputation
after deputation to obtain Alexander’s advice about a
second marriage and other family affairs, and finally
came himself. All these things were of such common

<note n="39"/> The Alexander or the False Prophet, 10 ff.

<pb n="p.33"/>

notoriety, that Lucian determined to satisfy his own
curiosity by a personal visit and, if possible, expose the
arrant humbug. As the incident illustrates so well our
author’s character, his utter contempt for all charlatanism, delusion, and falsehood, and the impulsiveness with
which he attacked them, it is worth our while to dwell
somewhat upon its details.</p>

<p>It appears, that in advance of his visit he had sent a
variety of questions, under seal, with which to test the
oracle. But Alexander had proved no match for his
relentless inquisitor, and quickly divining his object
and finding that he had shaken the faith of his rich and
aristocratic patron, Rutilianus, he conceived an intense
hatred for Lucian and at first tried to discredit him by
casting reflections upon his character. When he learned
of Lucian’s arrival in Abonotichos, whither he had
been escorted by two soldiers provided by his friend,
the governor of Cappadocia, to conduct him to the seacoast, Alexander sent for him with many professions of
friendship. Our author thus describes the interview
that followed:<ref n="40"/> “On entering his presence I found him
surrounded by numerous attendants. As good luck
would have it, [had brought with me my escort. Alexander extended his right hand for me to give the customary kiss. But holding it fast as if about to do so, I
bit his hand so severely as almost to maim it. Those
present attempted to throttle me for the sacrilege I had
committed, already angered also because I had addressed
their master as Alexander and not as a prophet. He,
however, putting up with the affront, very magnanimously stopped them and readily promised to make me
at home and show how good his god, Glycon, was, in
that he changed into friends even those who are very
angry. And putting all aside, he plead his cause with
me, declaring that he was well aware of the advice I
had given to Rutilianus. ‘What possessed you,’ said
he, ‘to treat me in this way, when through my influence you could have reached high preferment with
him?’ I was glad enough to accept this profession of
friendship, when I saw the dangerous predicament I
had yot into; and after a little I went forward, having

<note n="40"/> The Alexander, 55.

<pb n="p.34"/>

been made his friend. It seemed a good deal of a
marvel to the spectators—the change that had come
over me with such ease.”</p>

<p>Lucian had sent his father and other relations in advance to Amastris, a town on the coast of Bithynia a
little to the west of Abonotichos, and had with him
only his friend, Xenophon. Wishing to escape as soon
as possible from the clutches of Alexander, he rashly
accepted the latter’s offer of a boat and rowers to take
him thither. When they had got well along on the
voyage, seeing the captain in tears and expostulating
with the seamen, he began to suspect that foul play was
intended. It turned out that Alexander had ordered
them to throw Lucian overboard; and such, he says,
would have been his fate, had it not been for the tenderhearted captain, who declared that he had lived a
blameless life of sixty years and had a wife and family
and could not bring himself to stain his hands with
murder. He landed his passenger at a place called the
“Beaches” and returned home. Here Lucian found
certain Bosphorian ambassadors sailing by on their
way from King Eupator with the annual Roman
tribute. Informing them of the danger which he had
just escaped, he was taken on board and carried in
safety to Amastris, where with the co-operation of
many others he took measures to bring Alexander to
justice. But Lollianus Avitus, at that time Governor
of Bithynia and Pontus, would not hear to it, and
Lucian was obliged to abandon the attempt. Accordingly he proceeded on his journey, reaching the Agean
by way of the Troad, from which he took ship to the
Piraeus.<ref n="41"/>  During the voyage, which was somewhat
protracted, he had as a fellow-passenger the Cynic,
Peregrinus,<ref n="42"/> whom he had known of as a profligate
youth. According to Lucian’s account, Peregrinus
had afterward connected himself with the sect of Christians, in order to further his own selfish schemes and
had attained considerable authority among them, traveling about from place to place and supporting himself
by the contributions of his fellow-believers. But hav-

ing been discovered in some profanation, perhaps of the
Eucharist, he was excommunicated and subsequently
made himself notorious in Egypt, Rome, and in Elis by
his scandalous conduct. Fresh from his adventure with
Alexander and with a keen scent for imposture and the
ridiculous, Lucian amused himself with watching the
extraordinary proceedings of his fellow-traveler, whom,
years afterward, he was to meet again at Olympia under
widely different circumstances.</p>
</div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="10">
<p>HIS LIFE IN ATHENS.</p>

<p>He established his family in Athens, but was himself
probably absent in Corinth<ref n="43"/>  near the end of 164, or in
the beginning of 165, perhaps on the way to Rome to
accomplish a mission, with which he appears to have
been charged by the people of Samosata.<ref n="44"/>  On this
same journey he attended the Olympic festival of 165.</p>

<p>Lucian was now in middle life, and his settlement in
Athens marks the beginning of the most fruitful and
interesting period in his career, when he turned his back
upon the profession he had followed hitherto, and devoted himself to that work which was to give him an
abiding fame. His contact with the world in his extensive travels had broadened his mind and matured his
judgment. The varied spectacle of human life, which
had passed before his eyes, had awakened within him
many serious reflections. Gradually he had become
discontented with the unreality of the profession which
in his youth he had espoused with such enthusiasm, and
weary of its artifices, its shallowness, and flippancy and
brilliant pyrotechnics, its barrenness of ideas and
plethora of mere words; and above all he detested the
“deception and falsehood, the effrontery and shouting,
the hot disputes and countless other vexations”<ref n="45"/>  incident to the career of the rhetorician and advocate. At
heart Lucian was too sincere ever to have yielded unreservedly to such methods and practices, or without a
mental protest. Meanwhile he had been a close student

<pb n="p.36"/>

of human nature. Man, his illusions and follies, his
passions and the comic phases of human life had challenged his attention and interested him more and more.
Thus by a natural evolution he had arrived at that
moral and intellectual emancipation, which was the
capital event of his life, in that it secured for his genius
a free and untrammelled development.</p>

<p>His first impulse upon abandoning rhetoric was to
devote himself to philosophy, or, as he expresses it, “to
escape, as it were, from the surging billows of the outer
sea into some quiet haven and live out the remainder of
his days beneath philosophy’s sheltering arms."<ref n="46"/> 
Half-regretfully he thought of that moment in his youth,
when he had refused her invitations; and he resolved
to retrieve what now, perhaps, seemed to him a mistake. We see him in the first part of his sojourn in
Athens frequenting the society of the philosophers and
engaging in earnest discussion with them. He felt
himself especially attracted toward the representatives
of the Academy and the Lycaeum.<ref n="47"/>  He says of himself
at this times.<ref n="48"/>  “I wandered long in search of philosophy’s
abode, that I might hold converse with her. Accordingly, falling in with certain persons clad in coarse
cloaks and with long flowing beards, who said they had
come from her very presence, and thinking that they
knew, I would question them. But they, a good deal
more ignorant than I, either made me no answer at all,
lest they should betray their own lack of knowledge, or
they pointed out to me one door after another. At all
events, from that day to this, I have not been able to
find her dwelling. Many a time, on the strength of my
own conjecture, or under somebody’s guidance, I would
present myself at such and such a door, with the firm
belief that now I had found the object of my quest, arriving at this conclusion on account of the throng of
people going in and coming out, all of them of sad countenance, neatly dressed and of thoughtful mien. Accordingly, wedged in the crowd, I myself entered with
them, only to be disappointed in the travesty of philosophy which was found there. Accordingly,” he says,
“I at once retired, with a pitying look for the poor

<pb n="p.37"/>


wretches, whom she was leading around, not by the
nose, but by the beard, and who, like Ixion, were consorting with a phantom, instead of with Hera.”</p>

<p>In the Menippus wn the Rôle of Icarus,<ref n="49"/> where he
puts some of his own reflections into the mouth of his
favorite Cynic, he represents himself as having come to
despise all human things, the grotesqueness, insignificance, and instability of which his observation of life had
forced upon his attention, and to recognize that there
are higher problems worthy of one’s serious study, pertaining to the origin of this cosmos, its maker, the phenomena it presents, and what its consummation is to be.
“T assumed,” he says, “that the best thing to do was
to get a complete explanation from the philosophers. I
thought they at least would be able to tell me all the
facts in the case. . . . Accordingly I put myself
into their hands with considerable cash, paying part of
it down on the spot and agreeing to pay the rest afterward in return for the sum and substance of their wisdom. . . . But so far were they from ridding me
of my former ignorance, that they quickly plunged me
into even greater perplexities, showering daily upon me
first principles, final causes, atoms, vacuums, matters
and archetypes. But what to me at least seemed most
embarrassing of all was this—although there was no
consistency in what they said, but all their teachings
were at loggerheads and contradictory, nevertheless
they expected me to obey them and endeavored to bring
me over, each to his own view.”</p>

<p>The result was that philosophy which had won his
admiration<ref n="50"/>  as he had viewed it from a distance, or in
the person of a Nigrinus or a Demonax, lost its attractiveness upon closer inspection, when he saw the confusion and jarring inconsistencies of its various schools
and their passion for disputation and strife; and it became even repulsive to him, when he looked at it
through the lives of its exponents. He turned away
with disgust and indignation at the burlesque they
made of it.</p>

<p>He had abandoned rhetoric; philosophy he found
himself unable to adopt, for he could not affiliate with

<note n="49"/> The Menippus in the Rôle of Icarus, 4 ff. 

<note n="50"/> The Angler, 80.

<pb n="p.38"/>

those who professed to be philosophers, but belied the
name. Henceforth, to use his own words,<ref n="51"/> he was to
“make it his business to hate quacks, hate jugglery,
hate lies and hate conceit and hate every such class of
wicked men” and to be “a lover of truth, a lover of
beauty, and a lover of simplicity and whatever else has
to do with loving;” in short, to “hate the bad, and
praise and love the good.” He had discovered at last
his true vocation, the gift that was in him.</p>

<p>There is but little to note during the next ten or fifteen years of his life beside the publication of his satirical dialogues, in which he attacked with invective and
biting sarcasm the popular conceptions of religion, the
vanity of the rhetorician, the insincerity of the philosopher, and the manifold weaknesses, follies, and conceits
of human life. In order to get the public ear, he took
advantage of the lecture or public reading, which was
then all the fashion. The nature of his writings and
their dramatic quality made them especially available
for this mode of publication. It would seem that before
giving them to the general public, he was accustomed
to read his works before a select company of the leading
literary men<ref n="52"/>  of Athens, and with something of the
animated delivery, which he had acquired by long practice in the courts and upon the platform. We can easily
imagine what a sensation in that community his works
must have made, as they appeared in rapid succession.
People were at first astonished at the wanton freedom
with which he handled the pagan Olympus, for no one
before had ventured to assail the gods with such free
and easy nonchalance. But they soon began to laugh,
as they saw the divine myths stripped of the poetic
glamour, which had hitherto warned off the sceptical
intruder, and held up to ridicule in the cold, matter-offact realism of Lucian’s dialogues. And all except the
victims relished with the greatest gusto the sallies of
wit and sarcasm with which he attacked the pretentious philosophers of the day.</p>

<p>Lucian’s reputation at this time, in the new departure
which his genius had taken, probably did not extend
much beyond the bounds of Athens and its neighbor-

<note n="51"/> The Angler, 20. 
<note n="52"/> The Angler, 26.

<pb n="p.39"/>

hood. His life there was varied by occasional excursions, but these did not take him very far away.</p>

<p>In the Zeuxis<ref n="53"/>  he describes the admiring reception
that was accorded him in some foreign city; and to this
time is probably to be assigned the visit to Macedonia
referred to in the Herodotus<ref n="54"/>  and in the Scythian, when
he may have extended his journey to Philipopolis in
Thrace, the position of which is briefly described in the
Fugitives,<ref n="55"/> a dialogue written about 170.</p>

<p>Lucian was present for the fourth time at the Olympic
games in 169,<ref n="56"/> where he met again his former fellowvoyager, Peregrinus. The consummate impostor, or as
some regard him, the sincere fanatic, had announced at
the previous festival that on this occasion he would
publicly burn himself to death. Lucian was an eyewitness of his self-immolation, which, after several] postponements, took place one moonlight night among a
crowd of the Cynic’s friends and admirers. An affair
of this kind possessed a special interest to Lucian as a
student and satirist of the social phenomena of the time,
and with his usual frankness he did not hesitate to say
on the spot what he thought of it. If we may take his
word for it, his scoffings came near costing him dear.
The Cynics were so indignant that they almost tore

<note n="53"/> The Zeuxis, 1: “Quite recently, let me tell you, after reading my discourse
Iessayed to go to my quarters; but many of my hearers—for there is no reason
why I should not speak of such things even to you, my long-time friends—many
of my hearers popreacniog extended the right hand in welcome and seemed to
be desirous of testifying their admiration. At all events, they accompanied me,
and one from one quarter and another from another cheered and applauded,
until I turned red in the face, fearing lest I fell short of deserving such praises.
‘What novelty,’ they exclaimed. ‘ at a wondrous tale |’ ‘You are ap ingenious man.’ ‘ Nobody could say Beery aeige than your production.’ Many
such things they said, so evidently had they been charmed by what they heard,
For what reason had they for saying what was false,jand flattering a stranger
thus, who in other respects was not at all deserving of attention on their part.”

<note n="54"/> The Herodotus, 7-8, and the Scythian, 9.

<note n="55"/> The Fugitives, 25.

<note n="56"/> The Peregrinus, 35. If we agree with M. Croiset in placing the death of
Peregrinus in 169 rather than 165, the usual date assigned to it. M. Croiset
(Essai, p. 738-4) infers from the dramatic power which it exhibits, that the narrative of the death of Peregrinus was composed after Lucian had written most of
his principal dialogues. Benes it could not have been written so early as 165.
But as it was composed under the immediate impressions of the event which it
narrates, we are led to conclude that the celebration at Olympia, at which Peregrinus gave himself to death, was that of 169, Moreover the Peregrinus is
naturally associated with the dialogue of the Fugitives—written as late as 170—which is to be regarded as Lucian’s reply to the attacks of the Cynics, who had
been irritated by the former work. Had the death of Peregrinus taken place at
the celebration of 165, we should find some allusions to it in the midst of the
mockeries of all sorts which, in his other works of the years immediately
following, Lucian heaped upon the philosophers, and especially upon the Cynics.
<pb n="p.40"/>

him in pieces.<ref n="57"/>  On his return to Athens he wrote and
published his narrative of the death of the pretended
martyr, with the effect of arousing still further the
wrath of the Cynics, who naturally retaliated upon their
assailant for the shame and ridicule he had brought
upon them. It has been conjectured, and not without
reason, that the somewhat obscure dialogue of the F'ugttives was our author’s reply to his critics.</p>

<p>Of his private life nothing is known apart from the
few hints contained in his writings. As we have seen
he brought with him to Athens in 164 his father and the
other members of the family. It is probable that owing
to his itinerant life he had not married until his settlement in Athens, and there is nothing in his writings to
indicate that his home life was other than happy and
pleasant. From the Eunuchus,<ref n="58"/> a dialogue composed
near the end of the reign of Marcus Aurelius, we learn
that he had a son, at that time quite young. He lived
a simple, frugal life in keeping with his own modest
tastes and fortune. A man of his genial temperament
and sparkling wit would naturally mingle in the social
life of the place and be welcome upon festive occasions.
But he mingled in society rather as an interested, wideawake observer than as a conspicuous actor; and it was
there that he obtained much of the material] for his most
pungent satires. His social attitude in the houses to
which he was invited is well illustrated in the Banquet,
where he represents himself as witnessing a series of
grotesque and scandalous scenes without mixing in them
otherwise than by the liveliness of his impressions.
Again in the Philopseudes, or Lover of Lies, he appears
as a frequent visitor at the house of EKucrates, a venerable Athenian addicted to philosophy; and on one occasion, when Eucrates was laid up with the gout, his visitor, calling to inquire after his health, asks leave to sit
beside him upon his couch, while with familiar frankness he makes fun of the marvelous stories, told by his
host and a few sympathizing friends gathered about
him, of haunted houses, apparitions, goblins and magic
arts. In the Ship, or the Wishes, we see him, in company with some friends, following the crowd which had

<note n="57"/> The Peregrinus, 2. 
<note n="58"/> The Eunuchus, 18.

<pb n="p.41"/>

been drawn to the Piraeus to see a large ship that had
recently arrived, and then while returning on foot to
the city, discoursing sagely to his companions of “daydreaming and castle-building and idle-wishing for impossible blessings.’? Whether these scenes be actual
or purely of his own invention, they are doubtless a
transcript of the qualities which characterized his daily
intercourse with friends, a keen discernment and ready
common-sense and lively conversation, abounding in
unexpected turns and lighted up with playful mockery.
It is probable that he gathered about himself a limited
circle of intimates, some of whom he may have introduced by name in various of his writings. The account
of Peregrinus is addressed to Cronius. To his dear
Sabinus he writes the Defense of his course in accepting
official station in Egypt under one of the Emperors, after
having condemned such dependence upon the great in a
letter Concerning Salaried Companions addressed to
Timocles, another of his friends. In a long letter to
Philo he exposes the absurdities of some contemporary
historians and tells How History Should be Written;
and under the pseudonym Tychiades he recounts to his
friend Philocles in the Philopseudes some of the marvelous stories, upon which the credulity and superstition
of the age were wont to feed. It is not unlikely that
Celsus, the Epicurean, at whose request he wrote the
Alexander, is the same person whose True Discourse
was refuted by Origen.</p>

<p>The only one among the Athenian friends of Lucian
about whom he gives us any positive knowledge is the
philosopher, Demonax, with whom he had a long and
affectionate intimacy. Demonax was a philosopher of
the Cynic school, though not of the straitest sect, a
friend of Epictetus and universally respected and beloved. The portrait<ref n="59"/>  of him which Lucian traces in
terms of glowing eulogy describes him as impelled to
the study of philosophy by the love of honor and virtue,
as despising ordinary pleasures and devoted to liberty
and truth; living a sober, irreproachable life, and an
example of prudence and wisdom to all; not a narrow
sectarian, but one of those rare characters which seem

<note n="59"/> The Demonax, 1-10.

<pb n="p.42"/>

to blend naturally all sects and opinions in one; associating freely with all, without pride or ostentation;
with nothing of the rigor of the ascetic, but eating and
drinking like other people; never noisy, angry, or quarrelsome, severe upon the offense, but merciful to the
offender. By his kindly advice and the severity of his
reproofs he made those about him more decent and
orderly, and through his gentle, benignant philosophy
they became more cheerful and were animated with
better hopes of a hereafter. He was thoroughly unselfish, and in the spirit of that familiar line of Terence, he
thought that for one to be a man was sufficient title to
his regard;<ref n="60"/> and, withal, there was a liveliness of
humor and repartee which imparted an indescribable
charm tothe whole man, Of himself he said: “Socrates I venerate, I admire Diogenes, Aristippus I
love;"<ref n="61"/> and Lucian declared him to be the best philosopher he had ever known. He was one of the few contemporaries of his whom Lucian recognized as having a
genuine zeal for philosophy and as keeping in view the
principles of the old masters and ordering their own
lives in accordance therewith. His admiring friendship for Demonax was highly creditable to Lucian and
throws an interesting side light upon his own character.
Here was a man after his own heart, a fine type of the
sincere, truth-loving, well-rounded philosopher, wkose
fidelity to the best ideals woke a responsive echo in his
own nature and served to remind him that philosophy
itself was not a sham, and at the same time pointed with
a keener edge the shafts of mockery and satire, which
he levelled at her false and unworthy professors.</p>

<p>A satirist like Lucian, audacious, persistent, at times
impulsive, would be sure to arouse hostility; and the
enemies he made, at least most of them, were they better
known to us, would doubtless reflect equal honor upon
him with his friendships. Many of the portraitures
that appear in his dialogues were no doubt drawn from
life and with such precision of detail as to be readily

recognized, such characters, for example, as Thesmopolis, Zenothemis, Damis, Hetcemocles and Alcidamas;
and it would not be strange, if they winced, when thus
held up to public derision. The satirist revels in the
exercise of his gift and is liable to use it sometimes
without due discrimination and often with glaring exaggeration. Lucian himself was by temperament
peculiarly exposed to these faults. He did not always
distinguish accurately the false from the true, and sometimes he carried exaggeration further than is permissible even in satire, the force of which largely consists in a
certain verisimilitude. But for all that, it must be admitted, that the philosophers and rhetoricians, the fortune hunters, the parvenus and the arrogant and ostentatious rich for the most part deserved the full measure
of ridicule which he heaped upon them. The daring
ribaldry of the Auction of Philosophers, in which Lucian represents the great masters in philosophy, Socrates,
Pythagoras, Diogenes, Democritus, Heraclitus and
others, as being auctioned off in a slave market, most
of them for a trifling sum, naturally gave offense to the
philosophers, whose eccentricities of appearance and
dress and inconsistencies of life he was never weary of
satirizing. According to his own story he was in imminent danger from their hatred; but we can hardly
believe that it proceeded any further than threats of
vengeance. At all events, he wrote the Angler or the
Resurrection, ostensibly in his own defense; but even
there he could not refrain from his wonted assaults.</p>

<p>In the Professor of Rhetoric Lucian is thought to
have traced the portrait of his contemporary, Julius
Pollux, a sophist and grammarian, who had a private
school in Athens and was afterward appointed by the
Emperor Commodus to the chair of rhetoric in the university. The anecdotes and biographical allusions are
too precise not to have applied to some real person, who
in fact is indicated by a periphrasis<ref n="62"/>  based upon the
name Pollux. As the official representative of the art

of rhetoric before the Athenian public and undoubtedly
a man of reputation as an authority and literary critic,
he had probably indulged in some unfavorable criticisms upon the writings of Lucian, who had made himself obnoxious by publicly disparaging the art of the
rhetors and ostentatiously separating from them.
Lucian prided himself, and not without reason, upon
his fine Attic style, and any reflections upon that
touched him in a sensitive spot. Without some such
provocation as this Lucian’s satire seems difficult either
to justify or to understand.</p>

<p>The period of Lucian’s greatest literary activity
closed with the reign of Marcus Aurelius, From this
time on he rarely wrote and rarely appeared before the
public. He was now about sixty years of age, and
naturally wished to escape from the heated atmosphere
of controversy and recrimination in which the satirist
often finds himself involved. But after a few years of
quiet life, we find him again taking to the platform,
perhaps because his purse was running low; the same
reason which appears to have influenced him a little
later, when quite old and with “one foot,” as he says,
“in Charon’s boat,”<ref n="63"/>  to accept an appointment as law
registrar, or master of the rolls<ref n="64"/>  at Alexandria, in
Egypt, from the Emperor Commodus, or, as some
think, from Severus.</p>

<p>From this time we lose sight of him entirely. No
information worthy of credence has come down to us
concerning the time, or place, or the circumstances of
his death. Suidas hasan improbable story that he was
torn in pieces by dogs, a righteous chastisement, according to him, for Lucian’s unbelief and the blasphemies
he was charged with uttering against the Christian
faith. This story doubtless had its origin in Lucian’s
own statement, that he had come near being torn
in pieces by the Cynics, whose name Suidas construed too literally. When he became a Roman
official in Egypt, he was old and in impaired health.
He wrote, perhaps out of his own experience, in his old
age a serio-comic drama entitled Tragodopodagra in
which he sets forth the tortures of the gout.</p>

<p>He was not a profound scholar, any more than were
his contemporaries, but was remarkable rather for the
range of his acquisitions in the somewhat narrow and
exclusive lines which then constituted a liberal education. As a rhetorician he had studied his art thoroughly, and without becoming a slave to the methods
then in vogue, he knew how to appropriate to his own
use the best it had to give. His practical sense and fine
literary instinct enabled him to distinguish the true art
from the meretricious display, the affectations, trivial
refinements and empty platitudes, which had gathered
about it. Mathematics and natural science had no interest for him. Inthe Hermotimus<ref n="65"/>  he mentions, in
passing, some of the definitions of geometry only to
ridicule them; and through his favorite character,
Menippus, he mocks at the philosophers for trying to
measure the circumference of the sun, the dimensions of
the stars, the heights of the air, the depths of the sea
and the circuits of the earth.<ref n="66"/>  Lucian apparently sympathized with the Sceptics in their contempt for the
subtleties of mathematics; but in the Humanities he
was altogether at home. His writings abound in apt
quotations, showing an intimate acquaintance with
classic poetry and prose, though, after the literary fashion of the day, he had certain stock passages, which
were made to do duty on every possible occasion. His
mind was steeped in mythologic lore, which he employed with marvelous ease and freedom.</p>

<p>History had become an essential element in Hellenic
culture, and the sophists of the second century regarded
it as one of the forms of their art, and from it they drew
many of the subjects of discourse. Lucian’s familiarity
with this department is attested by the multitude of historical allusions contained in his works. That he was
a critical reader is shown by his tract upon How to
Write History, in which he ridicules the current
methods and points out the true principles which
should control in this form of composition. _ While he
made his seeming credulity the subject of ridicule, he
had a warm admiration for Herodotus, for the simplic-

<pb n="p.46"/>

ity, beauty, and Ionian grace of his style and the wisdom of his reflections; and he was not less sensitive to
the dramatic form of many of the scenes and events described by the historian and to the simple grandeur of
his imagination.<ref n="67"/> In the same way he had a superficial
appreciation of Thucydides, of the form rather than of
the substance, of the force of his thought, his truthfulness and independence, the gravity of his style, the
simple brevity of his exordium and the just proportions
of his descriptions.<ref n="68"/> </p>

<p>Greek philosophy had lost the boldness and originality of its earlier apostles and wa sreally in its
dotage. It consisted of little but the formal, distorted, dry-as-dust iteration of the old arguments,
the old objections, and the old replies, with nothing of the poetic grace and fine discretion which informed the discussions of the old masters. No worder
that Lucian found this prosing scholasticism distasteful
and insufferably tedious, while at the same time it
served to hide from him the true philosophy. His reading of Plato, Xenophon, and of Atschines, the disciple
of Socrates, no doubt suggested to him that facile instrument of his genius, the dialogue, which he turned to
unwonted uses, stripping it of the dignity with which
philosophy had clothed it, and making it the servant of
rollicking laughter and biting satire. “I found him
(Dialogue),” he says, “still wearing the air of melancholy to the multitude and reduced to a skeleton by continuous questioning, apparently regarded with awe on
this account, but not altogether agreeable or pleasing to
the mass of people. In the first place, I accustomed
him to walk upon the ground in the fashion of men;
then I made him more attractive to the beholder by
cleansing him of the grime with which he was covered,
and constraining him to wear a smile. But above all I
yoked comedy to him and in this way won for him good
will from the hearers, who before this were on their
guard against him, being afraid of getting in their
hands the thorns that were on him, just as in the case
of a hedgehog."<ref n="69"/></p>

<pb n="p.47"/>

<p>Another interesting characteristic of Lucian’s culture
was his knowledge and fine appreciation of the arts of
painting and sculpture. Love of the beautiful was an
instinct with him. He belonged to a family of sculptors, such as they were, and in his boyhood he had no
doubt learned something of the technical processes of
the art by frequenting the studio of his uncles. In his
travels he had looked with delight upon the monuments, statues, and paintings which abounded in the
great cities of Asia Minor, Greece, Italy and Gaul;
and his writings strikingly testify to the vivid impressions, which they had made upon his mind. In the
Zeuxis<ref n="70"/>  he describes minutely a painting by that artist,
called the “Female Hippocentaur,” which was lost at
sea, when Sulla carried it away, but a copy of which
was still preserved at Athens in Lucian’s time. The
Marriage of Alexander and Roxana, a work by Aetion,
from which Raphael is said to have obtained suggestions for one of his frescoes, is charmingly sketched in
the Herodotus,<ref n="71"/> and in one of the Dialogues of the Sea
Gods<ref n="72"/>  he gives a fine description of the Procession of
Europa, the details of which he is supposed to have
drawn from a painting he had somewhere seen. No one
among the writers of antiquity exhibits more taste, delicacy, and at the same time more sincerity, in the treatment of art.</p>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="12">
<p>HIS PERSONAL CHARACTER.</p>

<p>Judged by the standard of morals prevailing in his
day, Lucian in his personal character was a representative of the better element in heathen society. He was
to be sure a mocker, but his mockery was penetrated
with honest indignation and a profound seriousness of
purpose. He uniformly directed it against evil, against
deception, and superstition, against quacks in religion
and quacks in philosophy, against those who made a
god of their wealth, or committed crimes and cruelties
through unscrupulous ambition and avarice, and against
that false conception of life, so common in all ages,

<note n="70">The Zeusxis, 4 ff. </note>
<note n="71"> The Herodotus, 5.</note>
<note n="72">The Dialogues of the Sea Gods, 15.</note>

<pb n="p.48"/>

which makes it consist in the abundance of the things
that a man possesseth. It is impossible to conceive of
Lucian as other than a person of earnest, manly character, with the defects of his time, but essentially a
man of moral force and though not of the highest, yet
of worthy conceptions of right and duty, which in the
main he carried out in his own life. Through the various characters whom he parades before us, he leaves us
in no doubt as to where his own moral sympathies lie.
He makes Diogenes say to the King of Caria: “Mausolus shall tell of the tomb erected to himself in Halicarnassus by his wife and sister, Artemisia; whereas
Diogenes doesn’t even know whether his body has any
tomb over it, for he didn’t concern himself about that.
But he has left behind among the best men the reputation of having lived a manly life—a prouder memorial
than yours, O most servile of Carians! and one reared
upon a firmer foundation.”<ref n="73"/>  Lucian was honest and
frank, on the whole a sincere lover of truth and the consistent foe of hypocrisy, a man of unselfish instincts and
without malignity, meanness, or pretense.</p>
</div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="13">
<p>HIS ATTITUDE TOWARD RELIGION.</p>

<p>His attitude toward religion seems to have been that
of anagnostic. Constitutionally incredulous, the supernatural was repugnant to his intelligence, and he appears not to have believed in a personal god in relation
with the world. He did not assume the positive attitude of denial, but rather contented himself with mocking at those who claimed to know. As for himself he
did not know and was apparently resigned to his ignorance. And this resignation was easy for such a practical man of the world, whose mind was so occupied
with the objective realities about him, with life as he
actually found it, as to take little thought for the dim
beyond, much less to accept the absurd and puerile conjectures that formed the staple of current beliefs. The
world in which dwell the shades of the dead interested
him as the place especially, where the glaring inequalities of this present life are removed and all are upon a

<note n="73">The Dialogues of the Dead, 24.</note>
<pb n="p.49"/>

level, and where crime and injustice receive their due
reward.</p>

<p>Christianity had not yet attained a commanding position. It was only one among a vast number of sects,
and thus far had found its adherents almost exclusively
among the humble and obscure. It was two centuries
before the new faith succeeded in establishing itself in
the place of the slowly disintegrating fabric of paganism. But still it already held a sufficiently important
position in the world of the second century to attract
the attention of the curious observer. In the Mast the
Christian communities were quite numerous, and Lucian
in his travels there must have obtained some glimpses
of them. But, like that of the world in general, his
knowledge of them was vague and superficial. There are
only three or four passages in which he makes explicit
mention of the Christians. In the Alexander<ref n="74"/>  he represents the arch imposter as commending them to popular execration along with the followers of Epicurus,
because they, equally with the latter, stood in the way
of his designs. Inthe Story of the Death of Peregrinus<ref n="75"/>  occurs a passage of singular interest for its testimony to the simple virtues of the early Christians, the
fraternal devotion which bound them together, the zeal
with which they stood by one another in time of persecution, their ungrudging liberality, community of
goods, and unfailing sympathy, their faith in immortality and contempt of death, their renunciation of the
gods of the Greeks and worship of the “crucified
sophist, to whose laws they conformed their lives.
To Lucian Christianity was only one more phase of
religion, or rather of superstition. He gave it apparently only a passing thought. He did not penetrate to
its underlying principles, so utterly foreign to the
pagan cultus, by which it was surrounded, as not to
be readily comprehended by the transient observer. Its
votaries seemed to him worthy only of a half-disdainful
commiseration, because so easily duped, as he thought,
by any clever impostor like Peregrinus. Denunciation
and caricature he reserved for polytheism. For the

<note n="74"/> The Alexander, 25, 38.
<note n="75"/> The Peregrinus 11-18, See Appendia II.
<pb n="p.50"/>

Christians he has scarcely the shadow of mockery and
ridicule; for it is not necessary to read a tone of irony
in his description of their belief as “marvelous,” or of
their great leader as the “crucified sophist.’? Nor does
he concern himself with any of the unfounded accusations preferred against them. We may well believe,
that so far as he gave the Christian faith any consideration, he had a certain respect for the sincerity and uprightness of its followers and was favorably disposed
toward them, because of their rejection of the whole
system of paganism.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the notable religious revival fostered
by Marcus Aurelius, Greek and Romar polytheism was
tottering to its fall. Even by those who like Tacitus
and Pliny had lost their faith in the ancient religion, it
wag regarded as a political necessity to maintain it; for
they rightly judged that the very existence of the state
would be imperilled, if the popular faith were swept
away. Just how much Lucian hastened the process of
disintegration, it is impossible to decide. His writings
doubtless weakened the loyalty of some to the old system; but it is altogether unlikely that they had any
considerable determining influence upon the general
drift of religious thought. They were the symptom,
rather than the cause, of the deep undercurrent of skepticism which was undermining the entire structure.</p>
</div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="14">
<p>SUMMARY OF HIS WRITINGS.</p>

<p>The writings commonly included in the collections of
Lucian’s works number eight-three, covering thirteen
hundred pages of Greek text in the edition of Jacobitz.
Doubtless he wrote other pieces, especially in the rhetorical manner, which havenotsurvived. But we may
safely conclude that we now have all, or nearly all, of
those that possess any special interest or value. Of the
number above mentioned Bekker rejects twenty-eight
as apocryphal, Dindorf eleven, and Sommerbrodt
twenty-two. They agree, in eliminating seven, namely,
the Halcyon, or Concerning Transformation, the Defense of Astrology, the Philopatris, Examples of
Longevity, Encomium on Demosthenes, Charidemus, or Concerning Beauty, and Concerning the
<pb n="p.51"/>

Syrian Goddess. Of the remainder these critics by
common consent recognize forty-eight as genuine. ‘
Croiset agrees with them in the rejection of all the
above list except the tract upon the Syrian Goddess
which, it has been thought, was not written by Lucian,
because in the Ionic dialect and so at variance with his
usual manner, as to contain no ridicule or scoff at the
superstitions described therein. M. Croiset regards it
as a satiric imitation of Herodotus, whom Lucian dues
not directly attack, but with ingenious address assumes
his air, borrows his style, copies his mode of thought,
and under this mask recounts the marvels and fables.
The purpose of the piece he conceives to be in the same
line with that of the How to Write History, %.e., to
expose, but by means of burlesque, the false methods of
historical writing.</p>

<p>The French critic adds to the foregoing list (with
Bekker and Dindorf) the Amours and Lucius or the
Ass; (with Bekker and Sommerbrodt) the Sacrijices, Nero or the Isthmian Canal and the EKpigrams and (with Bekker alone) the Cynic and the
Pseudosophist, making thirteen in all, which from
the literary point of view—not to speak of certain impossibilities in the matter which they contain—seem to
him to present different characteristics from Lucian’s
genuine writings. He accepts seventy as authentic, not
all of them with equal certitude, but at least as not subject to serious contest. It is enough that the authenticity of scarcely any really important work attributed to
Lucian can reasonably be called in question.</p>

<p>Various attempts, with perhaps more or less of success, have been made to determine their chronological
order. It is, however, sufficient for our purpose to
classify them according to the two-fold division of
Lucian’s life, which naturally separates itself into the
rhetorical period, extending to the establishment of his
residence in Athens in 165, when he was from forty to
forty-five years of age, and the period of his maturity,
when he produced those works of social and religious
satire, which have given him his fame. To the former
period belong various short pieces, which were employed as prologues— προσλαλίαι—to lectures or readings,
<pb n="p.52"/>

 and in which skillful use is made of some striking
incident or description, in order to gain the attention of
the audience to what might follow—such pieces as
Concerning Amber or the Swans, Hippias or the
Bath, Harmonides, About the Serpents, the House,
and the Dream or a Chapter from the Life of
Lucian; and some more formal pieces, or declamations, such as the First and Second Phalarvs, a defense of the tyrant of Agrigentum, the Disinherited
Son, the Tyrannicide, the Eulogyum upon the
Fatherland, and the Encomium Upon the Fly. To
this time also belong the Nigrinus which was one
of Lucian’s earlier works, if we adopt the conjecture
alluded to in the account of his life; and the Portraits
and the Defense of the same, believed to have been
composed at Antioch about 162-3; and the Trial Before the Vowels, an amusing jeu d@esprit in which
Sigma pleads his cause against Tau, by whom he has
been despoiled of his rightful place; and as has been
already stated, the How to Write History was
written near the close of the Parthian war in 165.</p>

<p>Most of the works composed during the fifteen or
twenty years subsequent to his settlement in Athens are
of a satirical cast, either distinctly so, or with an undertone of satire. According to their main intent they
fall naturally into three classes: First, those in which
the pagan Olympus isattacked; second, the satires upon
human life and society, its vices, follies and wrongs;
and third, the satires upon the philosophers—a classification, observed for convenience in the present translation. Even where the leading motive is religious,
human, or philosophical, the others are often skillfully
introduced in a by-play of satire.</p>

<p>Besides the strictly theological or religious dialogues
contained in the following pages, there belong to this
class the Prometheus or Caucasus and the Zeus
Confuted. In the former, while Hephaestus and
Hermes are engaged in chaining Prometheus to the
mountain, he vigorously protests against the cruelty
and injustice of his fate and ventures to demand the
reasons which led the king of the gods to condemn him
to the cliff and the vultures. Hermes, coming to the
<pb n="p.53"/>

defense of his master, reminds the Titan of his pretended crimes, his deception in the division of the victim, the creation of man, and the theft of the fire, all of
which Prometheusturns so skillfully into arguments in
his own favor, that Hermes at last exclaims: “In making a show of defending yourself, Prometheus, you have
brought a terrible indictment against Zeus.”<ref n="76"/>  The
Zeus Confuted or cross-examined, is an attack upon
Zeus and the gods over the shoulders of the Fates. A
Cynic, obtaining from him the confession that Homer
and Hesiod were right in saying that the Fates order
all things, proves to his face that the so-called ruler of
gods and men is himself subject to inexorable destiny
and in fact has no power whatever; and he further
argues, that, as everything is foreordained, it is mani
festly unreasonable and unjust to reward or punish
men for what they do, and sacrifices and prayers are
of no avail. In a somewhat similar vein is the Saturnalia, in which the priest of Cronus, taking advantage of the liberty of his festival to mock at the gouty
and superannuated Titan, propounds some questions
concerning the legends about him current among
men and not very complimentary to their subject,
and asks why he resigned the government.</p>

<p>Among the satires upon human life and society contained in the following pages may also be classed the
Alexander or False Prophet, the Ship or Wishes
and the Lover of Lies, the scope of which have already
been described; and To an Uneducated Bibliomaniac,
in which our author satirizes the rich ignoramus who
thought to pass himself off as a very learned man by
gathering about him a large library; also the Mentppus or Necyomancy in which Menippus tells of his
descent into Hades to consult Teiresias, what he saw
there, especially the fate of the great and powerful.
The Crono-Solon and Letters of Cronus, apropos of
the festival of the Saturnalia, treat of the relations of
the rich and the poor. In the latter Cronus appears as
a mediator between them; in the former his priest and
prophet lays down the laws that are to govern the rich
in their treatment of the poor during the fétes, The

<note n="76"/> The Prometheus, 20.

<pb n="p.54"/>

Heteric Dialogues, probably Lucian’s work, though
that is questioned by some, are clever pictures of the
manners and customs of the Greek Hetaerae, with perhaps a lurking vein of satire.</p>

<p>The satires upon the philosophers include also the
Fugitives a reply to the attacks of the Cynics, whom
it describes as vagabonds and runaway slaves; the
Hermotimus, the longest and most argumentative of
his dialogues, in which he cleverly employs the Socratic
method, to convince a Stoic friend of the futility of trying to find out what is truth by following the speculations of the Stoic or of any other school of philosophy;
and the Double Indictment, which derives its name
from the two-fold arraignment of Lucian by Rhetoric
and Dialogue, the former charging him with ungratefully deserting her, after she had conferred upon him
such distinguished honor, and the latter with having
prostituted him to the base uses of comedy.</p>

<p>Besides many attacks which Lucian made incidentally upon the rhetoricians and the formal one contained
in the Professor of Rhetoric already alluded to, he
wrote the Pseudologist or Concerning the Word
‘“Arogpads,”? in which he defended his use of the
word against the claim of the sophist, Timarchus, that
it was un-Attic; and the Lexiphanes, ostensibly the
name of a young rhetorician, or grammarian, whom
he takes as a type of such writers as delight in archaisms
and strange and unintelligible expressions. The handsome Lexiphanes comes to Lucian one day for his approval of a composition, which the young rhetorician
has just written in this style. Lucian bids him read it;
but he has not proceeded far, when the former in disgust declares he has had enough of it and will go distracted, unless the youth at once gets rid of all this stuff
by taking an emetic. A physician happening along
just then, Lucian lays the case before him. The latter
gravely assures Lexiphanes that he is afflicted with a
very serious disease and prescribes an emetic, that he
“may think and talk like a human being.” After
many protestations the patient swallows the medicine
and is straightway relieved. Lucian then advises him
to place himself under instruction in the best poets and
<pb n="p.55"/>

orators, and Thucydides and Plato, and comedy and
tragedy, in order to prevent any recurrence of his
malady.</p>

<p>It is not to be supposed that Lucian abruptly forsook
the style of the “rhetor” and passed at once to his new
manner. The transition was in a degree gradual, and
traces of his former manner still appear in some of the
earlier works of the second period of his life, in such as
the Toxaris or Friendship, a discussion between
Mnesippus, a Greek, and Toxaris, a Scythian, as to
which of these two peoples the better comprehended
friendship and its duties; the Anacharsis or the Gymnasta, in which Solon and the Scythian, Anacharsis,
argue respectively for and against the grand passion of
the Greeks for gymnastic exercises; the tract upon
Dancing and that which sets forth the duty of Not
Hastily Believing a Slander. To this time belong also
several pieces, which may be classed as rhetorical
prologues, namely, the Herodotus or Aetion, the
Scythian or Foreigner, the Zeuxis or Antiochus,
and the Reply to Somebody Who had Styled Him a
Literary Prometheus. In the last mentioned he accepts the comparison, which had no doubt been intended
as a disparagement, and applies it especially to the fact
that he had ventured to introduce an original style of
composition—a new manner in literature—the union of
Platonic dialogue and Aristophanic comedy, of philosophic gravity and comic mirth, in harmonious and
elegant proportion.</p>

<p>There are three narrative, or biographical sketches,
which remain, the Life of Demonax, the Alexander
or the False Prophet, and the Death of Peregrinus.
These have already been characterized sufficiently.</p>

<p>Lucian has shown no little skill in the field of
romance. Three pieces may be classed under this head
viz., Lucius or the Ass, which inspired some of the
incidents in Gil Blas; the Dream or the Cock, which
is included in the present translation and may have
suggested Le Sage’s Le Diable boiteux, and the
True History. By many, e.g., Bekker, Dindorf,
Croiset, it is considered doubtful whether the first was
really Lucian’s work. It tells how a youth by the
<pb n="p.56"/>

name of Lucius, visiting at the house of a sorceress in
Thessaly and seeing her change herself into a nighthawk by anointing her body with some magic oil, conceived the desire to experience the same transformation.
Making friends with her maid-servant who obtained
access to the closet where she kept her ointments, he
happened to anoint himself from the wrong box and, to
his dismay, was transformed into an ass. The story
describes the varied adventures through which he passed
in his search for the rose leaves, by eating which he
was at last disenchanted and restored to his former self.
The True History, in two parts, is, next to the Hermotimus, the longest single piece among Lucian’s works,
covering forty-three pages in the Greek. The purpose
of this extravaganza is to satirize the extraordinary and
incredible stories of the old poets and historians, and of
the philosophers and certain writers of his own day, by
outrivaling them in the flights of his fancy and the exuberance of his imagination, and, incidentally, to ridicule
the universal passion for the marvelous and sensational.
He wittily avows in the preface that it is a “true history” only so far as the confession is concerned, that
there is not one word of truth in it; and throughout his
preposterous adventures on sea and land, above the
earth in space and in the ocean depths, upon the sun
and moon and in the Islands of the Blest, he preserves
a verisimilitude and shows a fertility of invention that
the most skillful romancer might envy. Either directly
or indirectly, in general scope or in minor details, this
romance of Lucian’s no doubt influenced, some of them
perhaps unconsciously, such modern writers as De
Bergerac in his Voyage to the Moon and Empire of the
Sun, Rabelais in his Gargantua and Pantagruel,
Voltaire in the Princess of Babylon and Micromégas,
Swift in the Travels of Gulliver, Baron Minchausen,
and Jules Verne in his numerous jeux @’esprit. Lucian
does not lose by comparison with these famous writers
in this style of fiction. There is in him a verve, a
facility, an affluence and a flow of spirits fairly astonishing.</p>

<p>Among the works assigned to his old age, or to the
time just preceding, are the Heracles and the Dio
<pb n="p.57"/>

nysus, two prologues written for the public séances
which he resumed for a season in his later years; the
Apology, avowedly a defense of himself in accepting
an office of state in Egypt, after having implicitly condemned such a course in the Salaried Companions;
the Hxzcuse apropos of an Inadvertence in Saluting
some important personage in the morning with dyiave
instead of yazpe; the tract upon Mourning, which in
a serious vein of polished satire sets forth the strange
and contradictory conceptions of the popular mythology
respecting the state of the dead, and the inconsistent
acts of those who accept them; and two short compositions in verse, the Tragedy of the Gout, and the
Ocypus, or Nimble Foot. There seems to be no sufficient reason for regarding these last as apocryphal.</p>

<p>As the author who struck outa new path in those
forms of composition which have given him a recognized place in literature, Lucian has had no little influence, by direct or indirect suggestion, upon later authors
in the same field. Besides those already mentioned,
Fontenelle, Fénelon and Lord Lyttleton in their dialogues, the novelist Fielding, Walter Savage Landor
in his Imaginary Conversations and Henry D. Traill
in his New Lucian, if they have not paid him the
compliment of imitation, have at least felt the impulse
of his example and original genius.</p></div></div>

you swoop down and snatch me from the midst of my

have fallen off and you now look like quite another

<p><label>Zeus</label> Well, my lad, it’s neither a man you see nor
an eagle; but the king of all the gods—that’s what I
am. I metamorphosed myself to suit the occasion.</p>

<p><label>Ganymede</label> Whatdo you say? Why! Are you the far-famed Pan?<ref n="2"/> How is it, then, that you haven’t got a

<p><label>Zeus</label> Why! Think you he’s the only god there is?</p>

<p><label>Ganymede</label> Yes, and we are accustomed, indeed, to sacrifice to him a he-goat, which we bring to the grotto,
where the god has his abode. But you I take to bea

that you are the person who lately poured down upon
us that tremendous hailstorm—the being who says he
dwells on high, who makes the noise we hear and to
whom my father sacrificed the ram? Pray what harm
have I done you, that you kidnapped me, O sovereign of

<p><label>Ganymede</label> What do you mean? Aren’t you going to
take me back to Ida right off, this very day?</p>

<p><label>Zeus</label> Nota bit of it! For in that case my changing from a god into an eagle would have been all for
naught.</p>

<p><label>Ganymede</label> Well then, my father will seek after me and
be plunged into sorrow at the fruitless search; and by

my flock.</p>

<p><label>Zeus</label> Why, where will he get sight of you?</p>

<p><label>Ganymede</label> Oh, don’t detain me, don’t! For already I
yearn after him. If you’ll take me back, I promise
you he’ll sacrifice to you. another ram as a ransom for
me. We’ve got one three years old, a big fellow, who

is, and that, notwithstanding he’s a lad still. (Resuming the conversation). But, Ganymedes, dismiss all
those things from your mind and forget them—your

already a god—from here you will be able to confer
many blessings upon your father and fatherland. Instead of cheese and milk you will live on ambrosia<ref n="4"/> and

crown all, you’ll be no longer a man, but immortal,

<p><label>Zeus</label> Oh, you’ll find out by and by, and when

<p><label>Ganymede</label> And where shall I sleep at night? With my

<p><label>Zeus</label> Oh, no! You shall share my couch. That’s
why I carried you off.</p>

<p><label>Ganymede</label> Why, can’t you sleep by yourself? Or is it

<p><label>Zeus</label> Yes, with such an one, indeed, as you, Ganymedes—so beautiful.</p>

to tell in the morning how I deprived him of his repose

<p><label>Eros</label> Yes, but he, nothing loth, lets me approach

<note>Introduction. When Peleus, king of the Myrmidons in
Thessaly, wedded the Nereid, Thetis, all the gods and goddesses
were invited to the festivities, except Eris, goddess of discord.
To avenge the slight, Eris cast among the company a golden
apple inscribed with the legend: ‘For the fairest.” The three
rival beauties, Hera, sister and wife of Zeus, and his two daughters, Athena and Aphrodite, at once fell into a hot dispute as to
which of them was entitled to the apple. Unwilling himself to
assume the responsibility of deciding, Zeus bade Hermes conduct

but especially venerated by young maidens, whose patroness she remained until
their marriage. Apollo was her brother.

the goddesses to Mount Ida in the Troad and submit the matter
tothe shepherd, Paris—otherwise called Alexander, defender of
men—the son of Priam, king of Troy at the time of the Trojan
war. Paris, when a child, had been exposed upon Mount Ida by
his mother, Hecabe, because it had been foretold that he should
bring about the ruin of his native city. He was brought up by
one of the shepherds there and, subsequently discovering his real
origin, was restored to his home. See Dial. of Sea-Gods, 5.</note></head>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="1">
    <p><label>Zeus</label> I say, Hermes, take this apple here and go
to Phrygia<ref n="1"/> to Priam’s son, the herdsman—he’s tending his flocks upon Mount Gargarus, a part of Ida—
and say to him: “Paris, since you are yourself beautiful and wise in love matters, Zeus bids you decide for
the goddesses as to which one of them is the fairest.
Whichever one wins the prize in the contest shall receive the apple.” Yes (turning to the goddesses), and
it’s high time for you yourselves also to be off to the
judge. For I love you all alike and so must decline the
office of arbiter; indeed, were it possible, I should like
to see you all win. Above all, whoever awards the
prize of beauty to one must inevitably incur the bitter
enmity of the majority. Therefore I’m not a suitable
person to act as judge for you myself, but there’s that
young Phrygian—go to him; he’s of royal birth and
kinsman of Ganymedes<ref n="2"/> here, and as for the rest, an
artless youth of the mountains. No one would deem
him unworthy of such a sight.</p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="2">
<p><label>Aphrodite</label> Well, Zeus, even if you should appoint Momus<ref n="3"/> himself as judge for us, I would go to
the display with full confidence. For what imperfection could he possibly find in me? The man ought to
be acceptable to these also.</p>

<p><label>Hera</label> Nor are we afraid, Aphrodite, no not even
if your Ares<ref n="4"/>  be intrusted with the decision of the matter. Yes, we accept even this Paris, whoever he may
be.

<p><label>Zeus</label> (To Athena.) Is this agreeable to you also,
my daughter? What say you? Do you turn away and
blush? Modesty, at least in such matters, is characteristic of you maidens. You nod assent all the same.
(To them all.) Now take yourselves off, and you who
prove unsuccessful, see to it that you don’t get angry
with the judge, or do any damage tothe youth. For
it isn’t possible that you should all be equally beautiful.</p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="3">
<p><label>Hermes</label> Well, let us make straight for Phrygia
—I’ll act as guide, and don’t you be slow in following
me, and be of good cheer! For I know Paris—he’s a
handsome youth and, as for the fest, of an amorous
turn and most competent to judge in such matters.
He couldn’t possibly make a wrong decision.</p>

<p><label>Aphrodite</label> That’s altogether good, what you say about
our judge being impartial, and just suits me. But is
he a bachelor, or has he a wife living with him?</p>

<p><label>Hermes</label> Well, I can’t say he is entirely single, Aphrodite.</p>

<p><label>Aphrodite</label> What do you mean?</p>

<p><label>Hermes</label> Why, there seems to be living with hima
woman of Mount Ida,<ref n="5"/> capable enough, but countrified
and dreadfully mountainish. He appears, however, to
be not much attached to her. But be that as it may,

why do you ask?</p>

<p><label>Aphrodite</label> Oh, I had no particular reason for asking.</p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="4">
<p><label>Athena</label> (interrupting—to Hermes). I say, you
fellow there, you aren’t honestly executing your mission
in taking counsel with this one only.</p>

<p><label>Hermes</label> Ob, there was nothing dreadful in what she
said, or to your disadvantage, my dear Athena. She
only inquired of me whether Paris is womarried.</p>

<p><label>Athena</label> Why, pray, is she so curious on that point?</p>

<p><label>Hermes</label> I don’t know. She declares, though, that
she asked the question casually, just as it came into her
head and not of set purpose.</p>

<p><label>Athena</label> Well, how is it? Is he unmarried?</p>

<p><label>Hermes</label> It appears not.</p>

<p><label>Athena</label> Pray, does he take to warlike exercises, and
is he sort of fond of glory, or simply a herdsman?

<note n="5"/> Woman of Mt. Ida: Oenoné, whose story is exquisitely told in Tennyson's
poem with that title.
<pb n="p.75"/>
</p>

<p><label>Hermes</label> I’m unable to tell you the truth of the matter; but from the fact that he is young, one can conjecture that he is also fond of these things and desires
to be foremost in battle.</p>

<p><label>Aphrodite</label> (To Hermes). See! Ive no fault to find,
nor do I charge you with talking privately with this
woman. Sucha course is characteristic of querulous
people, not of Aphrodite.</p>

<p><label>Hermes</label> Well, as to that, she asked me pretty much
the same question youdid. Wherefore, don’t take it to
heart, or fancy that you are being thrown into the background, if I gave her also a straightforward answer. 5.
But, if I may interrupt the conversation, we’ ve already
got on our journey a long distance from the stars and
indeed are almost in Phrygia. I see clearly both Ida
and the whole of Gargarus, if I’m not deceived, yes
and Paris himself, your judge.</p>

<p><label>Hera</label> Where is he? I don’t make him out.</p>

<p><label>Hermes</label> Look around in that direction, Hera, to the
left, not at the top of the mountain, but along the side,
where the cave is, where you see the herd.</p>

<p><label>Hera</label> But I don’t see the herd.</p>

<p><label>Hermes</label> Whatsay you? Don’t you see some diminutive cattle, just about as large as my finger here, coming out of the midst of the rocks and a man running
down from his lookout place with a shepherd’s crook
and restraining the herd from scattering too far?</p>

<p><label>Hera</label> Now I see, if indeed that is he.</p>

<p><label>Hermes</label> Yes, thatis he. But as we are now so near
let us descend, if you please, and walk upon the earth,
that we may not utterly confound him by flying down
from on high all unobserved.</p>

<p><label>Hera</label> Very well! Let us do so! (They alight).
Now that we have got down, ’tis time for you, Aphrodite, to go ahead and lead the way for us. For you are
of course acquainted with the place, having often gone
down to visit Anchises,<ref n="6"/> so it is reported.</p>

<p><label>Aphrodite</label> Your gibes don’t annoy me very much,
Hera.

Aeneas, was their son.

<pb n="p.76"/></p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="6">
<p><label>Hermes</label>  Nay, I will conduct you. I’m abundantly competent to do so, for I myself spent some time
upon Mount Ida, when Zeus, you know, was in love
with the Phrygian lad ;<ref n="7"/> and ofttimes I came hither, sent
down by him to look after the boy. And, indeed, once
when the king of heaven appeared in the form of the
eagle, I flew along by his side and helped to keep the
handsome fellow above water; and if indeed I remember rightly, he kidnapped him from this rock here, for
the boy happened just then to be playing his pipe to the
flock. Flying down behind him, Zeus himself very
lightly clasped him about with his talons, and with his
beak seizing his headgear carried the boy up on high,
who was utterly confounded and, with neck bent back,
gazed steadfastly at his captor. Then I, taking his
pipe, for he had thrown it aside out of fear—but
enough of this, for here’s the umpire right at hand.
Let us, therefore, accost him!</p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="7">
<p rend="merge">Hail, sir shepherd!</p>

<p><label>Paris</label> And you, young man, who are you, that you
have come here to visit us? And who are these
women, that you are bringing with you? For they are
not fit to be ranging over mountains, so very beautiful
are they.</p>

<p><label>Hermes</label> Nay, but they are not women, Paris; but
you see before you Hera, Athena, and Aphrodite; and
I am Hermes, sent hither upon a mission from Zeus.
But why do you tremble and turn pale? Don’t be
afraid! There’s nothing difficult for you to do. He
bids you act as judge of their beauty. “For,” to quote
his own words, “as you are yourself both handsome and.
wise in love matters, I intrust the decision to you.
You will know what the prize in the contest is, when
you have read the inscription upon the apple.”</p>

<p><label>Paris</label> Come! Let me see just what he wishes.
(Taking the apple, he reads.) “For the fairest,” it
says. But, Master Hermes, how can I, mortal that I
am myself and only a country bumpkin, how can I be
a judge of such an incredible sight and one beyond a
herdsman’s capacity to comprehend? The decision of
such matters belongs rather to dainty city folks. For
my part I could quickly decide according to the prin-

ciples of my craft, whether one goat is more beautiful
than another, or one heifer than another.</p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="8">
<p rend="merge">But these
ladies are all equally beautiful, and I don’t know how
any one could possibly tear away his gaze from one and
transfer it to another. For it cannot easily withdraw,
but wherever the eye rests first, there it clings closely
and admires what is right before it. And suppose it
does pass to something else, it sees beauty there also
and there remains fixed and is captivated by what is
near at hand. In short their beauty has poured itself
around and altogether compassed me about, and I’m
vexed because I cannot myself also, like Argus,<ref n="8"/> see
with my entire body. To my mind, I should decide
well, if I were to concede the apple to all. And with
reason, for add to this the fact, that that one (pointing to
Hera) is sister and wife of Zeus, while these are his
daughters. Surely, then, from this point of view also,
it is hard to decide the matter.</p>

<p><label>Hermes</label> Well, I don’t know. Only it is impossible
to hesitate in reference to a command of Zeus.</p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="9">
<p><label>Paris</label> But, Hermes, prevail upon them to agree
io this one condition, not to get angry with me—the
two who are vanquished—but to regard it as the fault
of my eyes.</p>

<p><label>Hermes</label> They agree to your request. But it is high
time for you to be rendering your decision.</p>

<p><label>Paris</label> Well, I'll make the attempt, for how can one
help himself? But I desire to know this first. Will
it be enough to look at them just as they are, or
must they also disrobe, that a minute examination may
be had?</p>

<p><label>Hermes</label> It would be your business as judge to settle
that. So give your orders exactly to suit yourself.</p>

<p><label>Paris</label> Exactly to suit myself? Well, then, I wish
to see them with their robes off.</p>

while I have turned away.</p>

she should display her beauty without any embellishments.</p>

have the right of it. So put it off!</p>

<p><label>Aphrodite</label> Yes, and why shouldn’t you, Athena, take
off your helmet<ref n="12"/> and expose your head bare? But do
you intend to shake the crest at the judge and intimidate him? Or are you afraid lest the gleam<ref n="13"/> of your
eyes be proved false, if one see it without something to
inspire terror.</p>

whether the gifts I offer you for a decision in my favor

<p><label>Paris</label> Nothing, Aphrodite; but now I should like
to hear from you a complete description of her.</p>

<p><label>Aphrodite</label> She is daughter of Leda, that beautiful lady,
to whom Zeus flew down in the form of a swan.</p>

<p><label>Paris</label> How does she look?</p>

<p><label>Aphrodite</label> Of fair complexion, as might be expected in
the case of one born of a swan, and delicate, as she was
bred in an egg, practised in many accomplishments and
expert in wrestling, and indeed so much sought after,
that war even arose on her account, Theseus<ref n="16"/> having
carried her off while yet a mere girl. Still in spite of
that, after she had arrived at maturity, all the noblest
of the Achaians came for the purpose of wooing her;
but Menelaus,<ref n="17"/> of the family of the Pelopide, was preferred. If indeed you wish it, I’1l accomplish the marriage for you.</p>

<p><label>Paris</label> What do you mean? A marriage with one
who is already married?

<note n="15"/> Hellas: Here used of all Greece, except the Peloponnesus.

<note n="16"/> Theseus: The legendary hero of Attica. He carried off Helen from Lacedawmon; she was afterwards rescued by her brothers, Castor and Polydeuces.

<note n="17"/> Menelaus: Grandson of Pelops, who founded the family of the Pelopidee, the
history of which was full of the most revolting crimes and a favorite subject for
the tragic poets. To escape the fury of his uncle, Thyestes, he fled to the king
of Lacedssmon, who gave him his daughter, Helen, in marriage. She was subsequently carried off by Paris to Troy, which act led to the Trojan war. In this
Menelaus was one of the most distinguished heroes of the Greeks.</p>


<pb n="p.81"/>

<p><label>Aphrodite</label> Oh, you are young and a country lout. But
I know how such things can be done.</p>

<p><label>Paris</label> How? For I myself also would like to know.</p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="15">
<p><label>Aphrodite</label> Well, you shall go on a journey, ostensibly, you know, to take in the sights of Greece, and when
you arrive in Lacedemon, Helen will espy you, and
thereafter I’ll attend to the matter and see that she fall
in love with you and follow you.</p>

<p><label>Paris</label> Why, that’s just what seems to me actually
incredible, that she should be willing to abandon her
husband and sail away with a barbarian and stranger.</p>

<p><label>Aphrodite</label> Take courage, my friend, from this fact.
I’ve got two beautiful sons, Himerus<ref n="18"/> and Eros, whom
I will let you have as guides for your journey. Eros
shall enter her bodily and constrain the woman to love
you, while Himerus shall pour around your own person
an essence that shall render you charming and lovely,
and I myself too will be present to aid you. I shall request also the Graces<ref n="19"/> to accompany us, that we may
all bring persuasion to bear upon her.</p>

<p><label>Paris</label> Well, Aphrodite, it’s all uncertain as to how
these things will turn out. Anyway, I’m already in
love with Helen, and somehow, I don’t know how, I
fancy I also see her and I’m sailing straight for Greece,
I find myself in Sparta and return with the woman,
and it irks me that ’m not already doing all these
things.</p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="16">
<p><label>Aphrodite</label> Pray, don’t fall in love, Paris, until you
have by your decision requited me for acting as matchmaker and conducting the bride from her home to the
bridegroom’s house. For it would indeed be fitting
that I, having carried off the prize, should be present to
aid you and celebrate simultaneously your nuptials and
my victory with a feast. For it is in your power to
buy everything for this apple here, love, beauty, a wedding feast.</p>

<p><label>Paris</label> But I’m afraid you won’t care anything about
me, after my decision has been rendered.</p>

<p><label>Paris</label> By no means! But give me your promise

<p><label>Aphrodite</label> Well, I promise you for certain, that I will
give you Helen for a wife, that she shall surely accompany you and arrive at your home in Ilium, and I myself will be near and assist you in everything.</p>

<p><label>Paris</label> And will you bring along Eros, Himerus, and
the Graces?</p>

<p><label>Aphrodite</label> Never you fear! Yes, Ill take along, in
addition to these, Pothus<ref n="20"/> and Hymenzeus.</p>

you the apple. Here! Take it upon these terms.

was, unless he kept a straight course. But he—he was

take the box, and after dragging it far out from the
shore, to drop it into the sea, that the poor girl might
perish—herself and the child.</p>

<p><label>Doris</label> And for what, my sister? Tell me, if you
know the whole story in any wise accurately.</p>

<p><label>Thetis</label> Well, Acrisius, her father, notwithstanding
her extraordinary beauty, threw her into a sort of
brazen chamber and sought to bring her up as a maid.
Then—whether it is true I can’t say—anyhow the story
is, that Zeus, turning into gold, streamed down upon
her through the roof and that she received the god into
her bosom, as he rushed down. Her father—a pretty
cruel and jealous old fellow—observing the fact, flew
into a passion, and thinking that somebody had debauched her, cast her into the chest, when she had just
become a mother.</p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="2">
<p><label>Doris</label> And what did she do, Thetis, when she
was being let down into the water?</p>

<p><label>Thetis</label> Never a word, Doris, did she say in her own
behalf, and submitted to the sentence. But with tears
she pleaded for the life of her child, holding it out to its
grandpa, for it was exceeding fair. While the child,
all unconscious of its hard lot, gently smiled as it gazed
upon the sea. My eyes are again filling with tears at
the remembrance of them.

<p><label>Doris</label> You've brought tears to my eyes too. Well,

the neighborhood of Seriphus,<ref n="3"/> keeping them alive.</p>

<p><label>Doris</label> Well, then, why don’t we rescue it by driving it into the nets of these Seriphian fishermen here?
They will no doubt draw it up and save the contents.</p>

<p>Europa had gone down to the beach on a picnic in
company with her mates, when Zeus having assumed
the form of a bull frolicked with them—a most ravishing sight! For he was white, with not a spot on him;
there was a graceful curve to his horns and he wore a
look of gentleness. He, too, capered about upon the
shore and bellowed with such witchery, that Europa
ventured even to mount him. And when this had been
done, Zeus started on a run for the sea with her upon
his back, and plunging in swam off; while she, in
mortal terror at the affair, kept fast hold of his horn
with her left hand, so as not to slip off, and with the
other secured her robe as it fluttered in the breeze.</p>

charming still. The sea at once became tranquil and
overspreading herself with a dead calm presented an
unruffed surface; while all of us, keeping silent, followed along as spectators merely of what was going on.
And the Loves hovering near a little way above the
sea, so that every now and then they lightly touched
the water with their toes, bore lighted torches and were
singing in chorus the wedding hymn. The Nereids,<ref n="4"/>
too, the most of them half-naked, came up out of the
sea and were riding alongside upon their dolphins and
clapping their hands. The family of Tritons and whatever else among the dwellers in the sea is not a terror

procession moved straight forward, for Poseidon, having
mounted upon his chariot with Amphitrite<ref n="5"/> riding by
his side, exultantly led the way, smiting a path for his

<head>Interlocutors: <label>Zeus</label>, <label>Hermes</label>, <label>Momus</label>.</head>



<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="1"><stage>SCENE. Olympus. Many aliens and foreigners havang been illegally enrolled among the gods, much
    to the disgust of those “to the manner born,”
    Zeus assembles a council to inquire into the
    right and title of these interlopers to the privileges of the Olympian mansions.</stage>
    <p>
<label>Zeus</label> Stop your muttering, ye gods, and getting
together off in some corner and whispering in one
another’s ears—in your displeasure, that many unworthy ones share the symposium with us! But now
that a council concerning these matters has been allowed, let every one speak right out just what he thinks
and lodge his complaint. And do you, Hermes, make
the usual proclamation in due legal form!</p>

<p><label>Hermes</label> (Making proclamation.) Oyez! Oyez!
Oyez! Who among the all-perfect deities that have
that privilege, wishes to address the house? The
business to be considered relates to the alien and foreign
divinities, who have established themselves among us.</p>

<p><label>Momus</label> I, Momus,<ref n="1"/> O Zeus, with your permission,
would like to speak.</p>

<p><label>Zeus</label> The proclamation already permits it. There
will, therefore, be no need of my intervention.</p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="2">
<p><label>Momus</label> Well, then, I say some of us are behaving
in a shocking manner. It isn’t enough for them to
have been themselves changed from men into gods.
Nay, but unless they place their followers and attendants upon an equality of privilege with us, they think

<note n="1"/> Momus: See Dial. of Gods, 20, note 3.

<pb n="p.96"/>

they haven’t accomplished anything great or mighty.
I demand, O Zeus, that you permit me to speak with
frankness. For I couldn’t do otherwise. On the contrary, all know that I’m free in the use of my tongue
and cannot possibly keep silent, when things don’t go
on right. For I put everything to the proof and say
right out what I think, without fear of anybody or concealing my opinion out of shame. Accordingly, most
people think me a nuisance even and by natural disposition a slanderer, and they call mea sort of public accuser. Albeit, since it is allowed and proclamation has
been made to that effect, and since you, O Zeus, grant
me leave, I shall speak without any dissimulation.</p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="3">
<p>Well, to proceed—many, I say, not content with
themselves participating in the same council-board and
faring sumptuously upon equal terms with us—and that
too, though they are half-mortal—have, besides, brought
up even their attendants and followers into heaven and
have illegally enrolled them among us, and now equally
with the rest they receive allowances and come in for a
share of the offerings, without having paid us even the
alien tax.<ref n="2"/></p>

<p><label>Zeus</label> Don’t speak in riddles, Momus, but plainly
and explicitly, and let us also have their names. For
you have now brought the subject directly before us, so
that many are trying to divine whom you mean and to
make now this one, now somebody else, tally with your
description. As you are a plain-spoken person, you
ought not to hesitate to tell.</p>

<p><label>Momus</label> Well said, Zeus, in that you even urge me
to frankness of speech. For you do this in right royal
fashion, magnanimously too. Therefcre, I will also
name them. Well, to proceed—there’s Dionysus,<ref n="3"/> of
the noblest extraction indeed !—half-human, not even a
Greek upon his mother’s side, but the grandson of Cadmus, a sort of seafaring merchant of Syro-Pheenicia.
Since, forsooth, he has been deemed worthy of immortality, I’m not going to say what sort of a fellow he is

for each family, laid upon the metoecus, or resident foreigner, in Athens.

Represented in art with almost a feminine expression of face. His huir falls

personally as respects his headgear, his getting drunk,
or his gait. For you all, I presume, see how womanish
and effeminate he is in his nature, half-demented and
smelling of strong drink from the first blush of dawn.
He has introduccd his tribe among us en masse and is
present here with the gang at his heels. Yes, and he
has made gods out of Pan,<ref n="4"/> Silenus<ref n="5"/> and the Satyrs<ref n="6"/>—
sort of country bumpkins, goatherds most of them,
frisky fellows and of divers uncouth shapes. The first
mentioned has horns and resemblesa goat all below the
waist and allows his beard to grow long and thick—
indeed he differs but little from a billy-goat. The second is a bald old chap, with a puck nose, and is generally mounted upon a donkey—he’s a Lydian,<ref n="7"/> you
know. Then there are the Satyrs, who have pointed
ears and are themselves bald and have horn-shaped protuberances like the rudimental horns of young kids—
they are sort of Phrygians. And they all have tails
besides, Do you see what sort of deities he is making
for us?—the generous fellow!</p>

<p rend="merge">And are we then surprised that mankind despise us, when they see such
grotesque monstrosities of gods? ForI omit to mention
that he has introduced among us even two women, one

placed in the company of the stars—and the other,
daughter of Icarius,<ref n="9"/> the farmer. And what is most

hero, Theseus, and aided him in his enterprise against the Minotaur. On his
return home he took her with him, but deserted her while asleep upon the island
of Naxos (see statue of sleeping Ariadne, Vatican). Here she was found by
Dionysus, returning from his travels in India, and became his bride. The
crown which he gave her at their marriage, he placed among the stars.

<note n="9"/> Icarius: A citizen of Athens who hospitably received Dionysus when he
visited Attica. In return the god taught him the cultivation of the vine and
gave him bags filled with wine. Some shepherds, becoming intoxicated _with it

under a tree, where after long search it was found by his daughter, Erigone.

ridiculous of all, ye gods, there’s Erigone’s dog, even
this he has brought up here, lest the girl should be distressed, if she hadn’t with her in heaven that pet poodle,

to you a piece of insolence, behavior befitting an old
toper, and matter for laughter? Listen, however, while
I name others also.</p>

heals diseases and is “worth a legion of men;”<ref n="12"/> while

semi-deities. For I couldn’t possibly speak otherwise.
Yes, and the matter becomes superlatively ridiculous,

Upon the death of Theagenes a bronze statue was erected there in his honor, of
which Pausanias tells the following story: An enemy of the athlete's went eve
night and scourged the statue with all his might, in the hope that the dead man would feel the blows. At last the statue got tired of this farce and unexpectedly
tumbled over upon the fool and struck him dead. His family brought action
against the statue for murder, and as a well-deserved punishment and an example to others it was sentenced to be cast into thesea. Not long afterward a famine arose among the Thasians, who thereupon had recourse to the Delphic
oracle for relief and were told to recall all those who had been exiled, They
obeyed, but still things were no better. Consulting the oracle again, they were
informed that they had forgotten to restore their fellow-citizen Theagenes. They
now bethought themselves that his statue, which had been thrown into the sea,
was meant, and they were in utter despair, for how could they hope to recover
it? But when they least expected, it was drawn up by some fishermen, into
whose net it had miraculously entered. They set it up again with great pomp in
its former place and thenceforth paid divine honors to Theagenes, in which they
were joined by various other Greek and Thracian cities. His statues were
reputed to heal all manner of diseases — Wieland.

Lucian makes it follow substantially the usages of the Athenian constitution,

it was to initiate legislation; and the Assembly, or Commons, holding forty
regular sessions each year and consisting of the whole body of qualified freemen, who passed upon whatever measure the Senate submitted to them, approving,
rejecting, amending it, or substituting some proposition of their own. The
Senate was divided into ten sections of fifty members each, each section representing one of the ten tribes of Attica and holding office about five weeks, its
turn being determined by lot. While in office its members were called Prytanes,
or Presidents, and in early times elected each day by lot one of their number,
called Epistates, or Chief President, to preside in the Senate or Assembly for
that day and to hold the keys and the public seal. In theearly part of the fourth
century B. C. this Epistates, while retaining charge of the keys and the seal,
chose nine Proedri, one from each tribe except his own, to preside in turn in the
Senate and Assembly. There was besides a State clerk, who read public documents to the Assembly; and each prytany had a secretary, whose duty it was
to record and publish decrees. At the head of a decree appeared the names of
the officers under whose administration it was passed.

<p><label>Zeus</label> The Stoic, Timocles, my dear Hera, and

they came to get into the discussion—were arguing
about fore-knowledge in the presence of a crowd of
eminent men—that is what especially annoyed me. On
the one hand, Damis was affirming that the gods pay
no attention at all to what is taking place, nor dispose
events—indeed have no existence. Timocles, on the
other hand—capital fellow that he is!—was trying to
help us. Then a great crowd congregating about
them, put a stop to any further conversation. So they
parted with the agreement to continue the discussion at
some future day. And now everybody is on the tiptoe
of expectation with regard to hearing it, to see which
one will come off victorious and apparently have more
of truth in what he says. Do you see the danger we

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="5">
<p><label>Hera</label> Really this is dreadful, Zeus, and not
without reason were you giving the affair the air of a
tragedy for them.</p>

<p><label>Zeus</label> But you thought I was in such distress out of
regard for some Danae or Antiope. Well, Hermes,

<note n="13"/> Damis: The Epicurean and Stoic were two opposite schools of Greek philosophy. The former founded by Epicurus (342-270 B. C.) held that pleasure, the
enjoyment of the hour, is the highest good and therefore the chief end of man
and of all philosophy. Epicurus, however, conceived of pleasure as consisting
in perfect contentment and peace of mind, though among many of his later followers it degenerated into sensualism—a not unnatural result; for, ignoring reason
and logic, he made the sensuous perceptions practically the only source of
knowledge. He believed in gods, but regarded them as consisting of atoms like
everything else and as cognizable by men through the images reflected from
them upon the senses. The gods do not concern themselves with the government of the world, and men are not immortal, but at death are resolved into
such elements as compose the universe. .</p>

<p>The Stoic school, so called from the Painted Stoa, or Porch, in Athens, in
which Zeno (344-260 B. C.), its founder, opened his school, held that reason was
the ultimate criterion of truth, that virtue is the only good end, therefore men
should be utterly indifferent to external circumstances, unaffected by joy or
sorrow, unmoved by passion, and all things should be submitted to, because controlled by fate, and that to be virtuous a man should live comformably to his own
nature and that of the universe. The noblest specimens of heathen life, such
as Epictetus and the Emperor Marcus Aurelius among the Romans, were of the
Stoic school; yetits tendency was to degenerate into formalism and an intense
egotism. Timocles and Damis, whom Lucian introduces as representatives of
fhe two schools, are perhaps fictitious characters.
<pb n="p.110"/>

Hera, and Athena, what shall we do? For do you yourselves also, on your part, aid in devising some plan.</p>

<p><label>Hermes</label> I say you ought to hold a council and lay
the matter before the whole body for their consideration.</p>

<p><label>Hera</label> I for my part agree with him entirely.</p>

<p><label>Athena</label> But I take the opposite view, my dear
father. You ought not to set heaven all in a ferment—
evidently it is not now disturbed over the affair—but
should take measures privately to insure the triumph
of Timocles in the argument and the retirement of
Damis from the conference, under a shower of ridicule.</p>

<p><label>Hermes</label> Yes, Zeus, but what you do will not escape
notice, as the debate between the philosophers is to take
place in public, and you will seem to act the part of a
despot in not consulting with all, concerning matters of
such grave moment and of common interest.</p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="6">
<p><label>Zeus</label> Well, you are right about it. So make
proclamation at once, and let all be present.</p>

<stage>Scene II. Hermes makes proclamation from the battlements of heaven.</stage>

<p><label>Hermes</label> See here, ye gods! Come to an assembly!
Don’t delay! Come together, all of you! Be on hand!
We are going to hold a council about matters of importance.</p>

<p><label>Zeus</label> Why, Hermes! Do you make proclamation
in such a matter-of-fact way as all that, in such homely
and prosaic fashion, and that, when you are calling the
gods together on business of the utmost gravity?</p>

<p><label>Hermes</label> But really, Zeus, how do you think it ought
to be done?</p>

<p><label>Zeus</label> How would I haveitdone? Why, I say you
ought to dignify your proclamation by clothing it in
some sort of verse and with poetic grandiloquence, so
as to secure a larger attendance.</p>

<p><label>Hermes</label> Yes, but that sort of thing, Zeus, is the business of verse-makers and rhapsodists, whereas I am
least of a poetic turn. I shall certainly spoil the proclamation by stringing together either too many feet or
too few; and they will laugh at the want of elegance in

my lines. At any rate, even Apollo,<ref n="14"/> I see, gets ridiculed on account of some of his poetical oracles, albeit
his skill at divination succeeds in investing most
everything with such an air of mystery, that the listeners have no leisure at all to scrutinize the metres.</p>

<p><label>Zeus</label> Well, then, Hermes, give us in your proclamation a mélange composed of the bulk of Homer’s
lines, with which he used to convene us in council.

fill up the assembly, but let them hold their tongues.</p>

<p><label>Hermes</label> Yes, that shall be done and they shall take
their appropriate seats. But we had better come to an
understanding on this point—suppose one of them is

workmanship, quite clumsy and wanting in symmetry

the first places. I’m made of gold, you know.</p>

<p><label>Hermes</label> No such thing, Aphrodite—at least so far as
Tcan see. On the contrary, unless my sight is very
much at fault you were, I believe, cut out of white
marble from Pentelicus<ref n="24"/> and then—for so it seemed
good to Praxiteles<ref n="25"/>—after being made into Aphrodite
you were bestowed upon the people of Cnidus.</p>

<p><label>Aphrodite</label> Yes, but I'll furnish you a trustworthy witness—Homer, who throughout his poems, calls me
“Aphrodite, the Golden.”</p>

<p><label>Hermes</label> Oh, that doesn’t signify, for the very same
author described Apollo as abounding in gold and rich.
But now you'll see even him sitting somewhere among

you together on the present occasion. Now that being

<pb n="p.117"/>

what I have to say. Well, ye gods, the crisis, now
upon us, all but has a voice itself, declaring that we
must take decided action in the present exigency,
while we, it appears to me, are utterly careless about
these matters. I will proceed at once—for my Demosthenes fails me—to set clearly before you the occurrences, which so perplexed me that I assembled this
council, Yesterday, as you know, Mnesitheus, the
master of a merchantman, was offering sacrifices of
thanksgiving for the deliverance of his vessel, which
came very near going to the bottom in the neighborhood of Caphareus;<ref n="35"/> and we were being feasted at
Pirzeeus—as many of us as Mnesitheus invited to the
sacrifice. And then, after the drink offerings were
over, you went off in different directions as each felt
inclined. But I—for it was not yet very late—went up
to the city<ref n="36"/> to stroll around at eventide in the Ceramicus, pondering the while upon the stinginess of Mnesitheus, who had provided only one cock for the entertainment of sixteen, gods—an old fellow at that and
affected with a catarrh—and four lumps of frankincense so very moldy that it straightway went out
upon the coals, affording not even enough smoke for the
tip of the nose to catch the scent—and that too, though
he had promised whole hecatombs when the ship was
just on the point of being dashed upon the headland
and had got inside the reefs.</p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="16">
<p rend="merge">AsI mused upon these
things, I came over against the Poecile.<ref n="37"/> There I saw
an immense throng of people huddled together, some
within the colonnade itself and many in the open air.
Some were shouting and engaging in hot debate, as
they sat upon the seats, I readily guessed what was
going on—that they were philosophers of your wrangling kind;<ref n="38"/> and so I was minded to stopand hear just

<note n="38"/> Your wrangling kind:

<pb n="p.118"/>

what they were saying. And—for, as it chanced, I
had thrown over myself a mist of thick clouds—I assumed the usual guise of those foiks and got me a
beard, so that I looked wonderfully like a philosopher.<ref n="39"/>
Yes, and I actually elbowed my way into the crowd
without its being known who I was.</p>

<p>I found there Damis, the Epicurean—the rogue!—
and Timocles, the Stoic—a capital fellow!—disputing
with great vehemence. Timocles, anyway, was all in
a perspiration and already had lost his voice from
shouting; while Damis by scornful derision was trying
to anger Timocles still more.</p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="17">
<p rend="merge">Their whole dispute,
then, was concerning us. That detestable fellow,
Damis, was maintaining that we take no thought for
men, nor pay any heed to what happens among them,
declaring that we have no existence whatever—for
plainly that was what bis talk amounted to. And
some there were who applauded him. Timocles, the
other disputant, espoused our cause and was taking up
the cudgels in our behalf. He was boiling with indignation and in every way was rendering us aid, eulogizing the care we exercise and explaining in detail how
we prescribe and arrange everything in its appropriate place and order. And he also won applause
from some.</p>

<p>But all to no purpose, for already he had grown
quite weary, his voice was in sorry plight, and the
crowd had their eyes fixed upon Damis. Knowing
what was being jeopardized, 1 ordered the night to
envelop them and put an end to the discussion. Accordingly, they departed, after agreeing to finish the
examination of the subject to-morrow. I followed the
crowd and overheard them, as they wended their way
homeward, praising among themselves what Damis
had said and not a few of them already taking his part.</p>

<p>But there were some also who did not think it right
to prejudge the opposing sides, but to wait and see
whether Timocles would say anything at all to-morrow.</p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="18">
<p>This, then, ye gods, is the business, on account of
which I have called you together; and it is of no little

importance, if you will reflect that all the honor, worship and glory we have come from men. If they
ghould be persuaded that we have no existence at all,
or—if we do exist—that we take no thought for them,
there would be no more sacrifices or oblations or worship rendered us from the earth, and we should sit idly
here in heaven and starve, deprived, as we should be,
of those feasts, holy-days, public games, sacrificial rites,
all—night banquets and solemn processions, which we
have been accustomed to enjoy. As, then, the business
in hand relates to matters of such grave importance, I
say it behooves us all to be devising some plan, that
shall bring us deliverance in the present crisis and by
which Timocles shall come off victorious and be
thought to have more of truth in what he says, while
Damis shall be laughed down by his hearers. For I
for my part have no confidence at all in Timocles, that
he will carry the day of himself, unless we also come to
his aid. (Turning to Hermes.) Now, Hermes, make
proclamation in due legal form, that they get up and
recommend some measure.</p>

<p>Scene II. Hermes makes proclamation, and various
divinities take part in the discussion which
follows.</p>

<p><label>Momus</label> Well, then, listen, ye gods, to what at all
events comes from the heart, to use a common expression. I for my part was fully expecting that our affairs
would get into this helpless condition and that many
such sophists would arise to our detriment, who would
derive from our very selves the occasion for their presumption. By all that’s just, it isn’t meet to be angry
with Epicurus or with his disciples and those who have
succeeded to his opinions, if they have taken up such
notions concerning us. For what else could one expect
them to think, when they see such disorder in the
world, the good among them treated with neglect and
perishing in poverty, disease and slavery, while the
utterly depraved and impure are preferred in honor,
roll in wealth and lord it over their betters; and when
they see the robbers of temples unpunished, nay unnoticed, while those who do no wrong are sometimes
impaled or beaten to death?</p>

<p>Naturally enough, then, at sight of these things
they come to the conclusion that we have no existence
at all;</p>

resulted in the destruction of his own.

happy and immortal—what else, by good rights, can
they do, but make fun of us and set at naught our prerogatives? But we get angry, if certain men, who are
by no means fools, utterly disprove these claims of ours

ought to be well content if some do sacrifice to us still,
notwithstanding we have such failings.</p>

here and watch for this one thing only, to see if somebody is offering an oblation, or raising the steam of

just as it happens. Accordingly, we are now suffering
just what we might reasonably expect, and we shall
continue to suffer thus, whenever mankind come to lift
up their heads and little by little discover that they
derive no advantage at all from sacrificing to us and

when he discourses in private with his pupils. But his
courage all oozes out when he comes to speak before a
crowd; he doesn’t know how to use his voice and talks
broken Greek, so that he provokes laughter because of
this; for in conversation he doesn’t speak connectedly,
but stutters and is all in a fluster, especially whenever,
notwithstanding these faults, he wants to display also
elegance of language. He is, though, exceedingly
quick to understand and subtle in mind, according to
the statements of those who are better acquainted than
I with the teachings of the Stoics. But in speech and
exposition he spoils it all through physical weakness
and jumbles everything together, not making clear
what he wants to say. On the contrary, he advances
his propositions in the form of riddles and in his turn
answers the questions put to him with still greater
vagueness. People, because they don’t comprehend,
make fun of him. He ought, I think, to speak plainly
and give particular attention to this, so that his hearers
shall understand.</p>

same; the seasons come each in its turn; plants grow,

such skill that they maintain themselves, think, move,
walk, build houses, make shoes, and go on. Are not

that come to pass, I also would say myself. However,

occur as the result of any forethought, It is possible

by Providence. As the comic poet says:

truth.</p>

concede that he, or any other poet, is a trustworthy

<p>Briareus, our most excellent sovereign, Zeus, would
have been seized and carried off and clapped into chains.
Out of gratitude to Thetis for this service he deceived
Agamemnon by sending a false dream, in order that
many of the Achaians might be killed, D’ye see? For
he couldn’t possibly have hurled a thunderbolt at
Agamemnon himself and consumed him, without being
thought a cheat. Or was it those stories you heard,
that had the most influence in persuading you into this
belief? namely, how Diomedes wounded Aphrodite<ref n="76"/>

performances, one of two alternatives follows inevitably:—either you must regard Polus, Aristodemus and
Satyrus<ref n="79"/>  as gods, or believe that there is something
divine in the very masks used to represent the gods, in
the busking, the tunics reaching to the feet, in the short
mantles, long flowing sleeves, the false bellies and padding and so on, with which they give a grave and
solemn air to tragedy—indeed, a most ridiculous
notion, I think. But, when Euripides is not controlled by the requirements of his dramas and expresses
his own real sentiments, then hear him, as he frees his
mind:
<quote>
<l>Seest thou the boundless aethe<ref n="80"/>  above.</l>
<l>All girt around the earth in moist embrace?</l>
<l>To this give Zeus’ high name; deem this the very god.</l>
</quote>
</p>

<p>And again:
<quote>
<l>Zeus, whoever Zeus may be, I ken not who,</l>
<l>Save as I list to legend’s far-off voice.</l>

<p>And so on.</p>

<p><label>Timocles</label> Are then all mankind and the nations of the

<p><label>Damis</label> It was very good of you, Timocles, to remind
me of the diversity of belief that prevails among the
nations,—from which very fact a person can see ata
glance that the doctrine concerning gods has nothing
certain about it. All is confusion; one believes one
thing; another, another. Scythians sacrifice to a sword;
Thracians to Zamolxis, a runaway slave, who came to
them from Samos; Phrygians to the Moon, and Ethiopians to Day; Cyllenians to Phales,<ref n="81"/> and Assyrianstoa

mon object of worship with all, yet the people of Memphis have the bull fas their own particular deity; the
Pelusians<ref n="82"/>  an onion; others have an ibis, or crocodile,
and others still a dog-faced baboon, a cat, or ape.
Moreover, in single villages, some regard the right
shoulder as a god, while those who dwell across the
way regard the leftassuch. With others it’s half of the
head, and yet others worship an earthen wine cup or
bowl. This is certainly matter for laughter—isn’t it,
Timocles, my fine fellow?</p>

<p><label>Momus</label> (Aside.) Didn’t I tell you, ye gods, that all
these things were going to come out and would be subjected to a rigid scrutiny?</p>

<p><label>Zeus</label> That you did, Momus, and your criticism
was just. I for my part am going to try and correct
these abuses, provided we escape this immediate
danger.</p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="43">
<p><label>Timocles</label> (To Damis.) But, you enemy of the gods,
there’s the oracles and the prophecies of future events
—whose work would you call them?—of the gods and
of their providential care?</p>

<p><label>Damis</label> Hold your tongue about the oracles, my dear
sir, for I’m going to ask you a question—which one of
them do you deem most worthy of mention? Is it the
one that the Pythian gave Croesus, which cut both
ways to a hair and was double-faced, just like some of
those images of Hermes,<ref n="83"/> that have two faces and present the same aspect on both sides, whichever way you
look at them? Of course that’s the one. But can you
tell from the oracle whether Croesus will be more likely
to break up his own empire by crossing the Halys, or
that of Cyrus? And yet that old plague of a Sardian
paid not a few talents for this ambiguous prophecy.</p>

<p><label>Momus</label> (Aside.) There! ye gods, the fellow is calling attention to the very points which I most feared.
Where now is our handsome player on the harp?

<p><label>Timocles</label> (To Damis.) Just see, Damis, what you
are doing, you sinner! You are all but overturning the
very temples of the gods by your talk, and their altars
too.</p>

<p><label>Damis</label> Nay, Timocles, not all the altars would I
overturn. For what serious harm proceeds from them,
if they are full of fragrant stuffs and give forth sweet
perfume? But those of Artemis among the Taurians<ref n="84"/>

he goes on, the fellow will tackle some one even of

</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="45">
<p><label>Timocles</label> But, Damis, you who fight against the
gods, pray don’t you hear Zeus when he thunders?</p>

<p><label>Damis</label> Why, how can I help hearing the thunder,
Timocles? But as to whether it is Zeus who thunders,
you would know better, had you come down from
somewhere there—from the gods. These people here
from Crete, though, tell us a different story,<ref n="86"/> that a
grave is shown there, over which stands a tombstone
setting forth that Zeus has got through thundering,

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="46">
<p><label>Timocles</label> (To Damis.) Say, you accursed monster!
have you ever taken a sea voyage?</p>

<p><label>Damis</label> Yes, many a time, Timocles!</p>

<p><label>Timocles</label> Well, at such times, while the oarsmen were
bearing you on your way, or the wind, striking the
mainsail and filling the staysails, wasn’t there also
some one man in command, who steered the vessel and
brought it into port in safety?</p>

<p><label>Damis</label> Certainly!</p>

<p><label>Timocles</label> The vessel, then, was not sailing without a
helmsman, was it? But do you conceive that this universe is borne along without a pilot, with no one to
guide it?</p>

<p><label>Zeus</label> (Aside.) Bravo, Timocles! Your illustration is right to the point.</p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="47">
<p><label>Damis</label> But, Timocles—you favorite of the gods—
that helmsman you would have seen all the while making suitable plans, getting ready beforehand and giving orders to the seamen; and the vessel hadn’t a thing
about it that was useless or not adapted to the purpose,
or that was altogether unserviceable and unnecessary
for their voyage. But this pilot of yours—who, you
claim, is in command of this mighty ship of the universe—and his shipmates arrange not one thing sensibly
and with an eye to what is fit. But the forestay is
made fast to the stern, just as it happens, while the
sheets are both secured to the prow; sometimes the
anchors are of gold, and the end of the stern, shaped
like a goose’s neck, is made of lead; and those parts of
the ship below the water line are painted over while the
partsabove waterare unsightly.</p>

tailed to bail out the bilge-water. The case is just the
same even with the passengers. There’s a sorry knave
sitting upon a privileged seat near the helmsman—every
body is paying court to him; and there’s another—a
lewd fellow or, may be, a parricide, or temple-robber—
who is held in great honor and has taken possession of
the highest place in the ship; while many accomplished
gentlemen you will see crowded together away down
in the hold and trampled upon by those who in point
of fact are their inferiors, At all events, reflect how
Socrates, Aristides and Phocion<ref n="88"/>  made the voyage—
who hadn’t even barley meal enough, nor were they
allowed so much as to lie down upon the bare deck

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="49">
<p>That’s the way things go, on board your
vessel, Timocles, you paragon of wisdom! Hence it is,
that there’s no end of shipwrecks. Now, if there had
been a pilot in command, who was in the habit of
looking after and ordering everything, in the first place,
he would have known who are the good and who the
bad among those on board; and secondly, he would
have given to each one his deserts—to the better class,
the better place, on high, close by himself, but the lower
place to the worse. Some of the better ones he would
have made his messmates and counsellors, and any
sailor who was full of zeal would have been appointed
prow-master or commander of one side of the ship, or,
at all events, would have been given the precedence of
the rest; while he who flinches from duty, or is lazy,
would have been beaten upon the head with small cords
five timesaday. So then, my admirable friend, this

<p><label>Zeus</label> You are correct in your conjecture, Momus.

commonplace arguments, all of them easily overthrown

<p><label>Timocles</label> (To Damis.) Well, then, since in your
opinion, my illustration of the ship isn’t at all conclusive just listen, and I’ll give you the argument that

it—which, no way you can fix it, will you be able to
break asunder.</p>

<p><label>Zeus</label> (Aside.) What in the world is he going to
say now?</p>

<p><label>Timocles</label> (Almost indespair.) Pray, see if there’s any
flaw in this syllogism of mine, and upset it if you possibly can! If there are altars, there must also be gods,
Now, we know, altars do exist; therefore gods also
exist. What do you say to that?</p>

<p><label>Damis</label> I'll answer you, as soon as I get my fill of
laughter.</p>

<p><label>Timocles</label> But, to all appearance, you’ll never stop
laughing. All the same, tell me in what respect my
statement seemed to you ridiculous?</p>

<p><label>Damis</label> Why, because you fail to see by what a
slender thread you have suspended your anchor—and a
sheet-anchor at that. By merely coupling the assertion
of the existence of the gods with the fact that there are
altars you assume that you have made the chain composed of these propositions a strong one. Accordingly,
as you say you’ ve nothing better to offer in the way of a
sheet-anchor, we may as well be off at once.</p>

<p><label>Damis</label> Yes, Timocles—if you will haveitgso. For
just as those do, who are hard-pressed by somebody, so
you have taken refuge at the altars, in order to get
out of our reach, Therefore, by that sheet-anchor of
yours, I’m willing to swear a truce with you at once

their confidence and betray them into the hands of the Persians. The Babylonians, trusting his assurance that he had deserted in order to avenge himself
upon the king for the pretended outrage, placed him in charge of the principal
gates, through which at the critical moment he admitted his countrymen. Darius
go appreciated this service that he often declared he would rather Zopyrus had

entreats a crocodile, which is making off with her child in his jaws, to be so good
as to give back her boy. “That I will do,” replied he, “provided you answer truly
this question. Tell me, am I going to give you back the boy, or not?” She may
reply either yes, or no. In either case she will not get back her child. Says she:
“ You do not intend to restore it to me.” But he gives it back to her, and it follows that she has not told the truth and hence has lost the wager and must return the child to the crocodile. Or, says she: “You intend to give it back.”
Then he replies: “ That's false. I’ve no intention of doing anything of the sort,”
and proceeds to devour the child. And the mother cannot charge him with a
breach of the agreement, for she did not tell the truth. The grammarian, Aphthonius, advises the mother to give the first answer and then make off with the
child, which the crocodile must restore to her in order to convict her of falsehood. If she can run faster than the crocodile, it is the best advice, no doubt, so
far as rescuing the child is concerned; but the sophism remains unsolved.—

<p><label>Diogenes</label> Now I understand it clearly. According

<p><label>Heracles</label> No, you fool! We were both the very same

<p><label>Heracles</label> Why, do not all beings seem to you to be

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="5">
<p><label>Diogenes</label> Well, my dear son of Amphitryon, you
would have explained the matter satisfactorily, if you
were body; but as it is, you are incorporeal ghost. You
run the risk, therefore, of making Heracles a threefold
existence already.</p>

<p><label>Heracles</label> How threefold?</p>

<p><label>Diogenes</label> Well, in some such way as this. If the one,
whoever he be, is in heaven and the other—7.e., you his
counterpart—is with us, and if his body has dissolved
already into dust—why, you see, there’s three. You
had better be considering, then, just whom you have
in mind as father number three—for the body.</p>

from Sinope. For I was king of all Caria and ruled also
over some Lydians, brought a number of islands under
my sway and advanced as far as Miletus, conquering
most of Ionia; I was also tall and handsome, and puissant in war. But chiefly because I have a colossal

dead man ever had one so large or even so beautifully
wrought—perfect representations of men and horses

As for your tomb and those costly stones, the people of
Halicarnassus might perhaps put them on exhibition
and pride themselves before strangers upon having
really a pretty large structure. But you, my dear sir,
I do not see what possible benefit you can derive from
it, unless it be that to which you refer—namely, that
you sustain a heavier burden than we do, weighed down

what I saw, when I came down that road.</p>

<p><label>Diogenes</label> By all means, Crates! From your looks, I
take it you’ve seen some quite funny things,</p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="2">
<p><label>Crates</label> Well, to proceed —many others besides
were our companions on the way down, among them
some people of note. There were Ismenodorus,<ref n="5"/> our
wealthy countryman, and Arsaces, viceroy of Media, and
Oroetes, the Armenian. Ismenodorus—he had been
murdered, you know, by robbers in the neighborhood
of Cithaeron,<ref n="6"/> I think, when on the way to Eleusis—:
well, Ismenodorus was groaning and had hold of the
wound with both hands; and his children—whom he
had left behind, because they were mere infants—he
kept calling by name and reproaching himself for his
temerity in crossing Cithzron and passing through
the districts around Eleutheree—utterly desolate as they
were from the wars—accompanied by only two servants
and that though he had with him five golden bowls and
four cups.</p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="3">
<p rend="merge">As for Arsaces, he was already stricken
in years, and upon my word, not undignified in appearance—Arsaces was expressing in barbaric fashion his
vexation and displeasure at going afoot, and kept demanding that his horse be brought to him. For his
horse had been killed at the same time he was, both
having been run through at one blow by a certain
Thracian targeteer<ref n="7"/>  in the struggle against the Cappadocian at the Araxes.<ref n="8"/>  Arsaces—according to his own
story—was riding along, having unbeknown to them
gone out some distance in advance of the others, when
the Thracian, lying inambush under cover of his shield,
pushes aside Arsaces’ spear, and putting his own long
pee beneath, transfixes both the man himself and his

horse.</p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="4">

be done at one stroke?</p>

was advancing with his lance—twenty cubits long or
so—leveled; and the Thracian, after parrying the
thrust with his shield and when the point had slipped
past him, dropping upon his knee, received the charge
with his pike and wounded the horse beneath the breast,
who in the fury and violence of his struggles drove the
weapon through himself. Arsaces also was thrust
through and through from the groin as far as the rump.
You see what sort of an affair it was—the doing not of
the man, but rather of the horse. All the same, he
was vexed at being put upon a level with everybody
else and insisted upon going down on horseback.</p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="5">
<p>
Oroetes for his part was very tender-footed and unable
even to stand upon the ground, to say nothing of walking. All Medes in fact suffer in this way, whenever
they dismount from their horses, and walk with great
difficulty on tiptoe, as though they were treading upon
thorns. When, therefore, having thrown himself down
he lay sprawled out and flatly refused to get up,
Hermes—most excellent fellow that he is—raised him
up and carried him to the ferry, while I was convulsed
with laughter.</p>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="6">

events, it was plain to be seen that he was extremely
cadaverous and mere skin and bone. Though I knew
the circumstances, I plied them with questions as to the
manner of their taking off. “Well,” said I to Damis,
who was upbraiding his son, “you got your deserts,
though, at his hands, since, when you had in round
numbers a thousand talents and fared sumptuously
yourself—ninety years of age though you were, while
your son was eighteen—you used to dole out to the young
man the paltry sum of four obols. And you, O Acarnanian there”—he too was groaning and calling down
curses upon Myrtion—“why do you find fault with
Eros,<ref n="13"/> when you ought to blame yourself—you, who
never quailed before the enemy, but from sheer love of
danger were wont to fight in front of the rest, while you
were conquered by the feigned tears and sighs of a
chance young miss—a brave man, indeed!” Blepsias
on his part kept accusing himself beforehand of consummate folly in keeping guard over his property, all
for the benefit—as it proved—of heirs who bore no relation to him, thinking—the fool!—that he was going
to live forever. However, their groaning afforded me
at least no little enjoyment at that time.</p>

may—as for the men of “ye olden time,’ you know,

it’s either some ons who has been poisoned to death by

themselves in your presence—how the former was red-

<note n="24"/> Nestor: An aged chieftain of the Greeks at the siege of Troy, so distinguished
for justice, wisdom, bravery, eloquence and knowledge of war, that his advice
was appealed to in every emergency. Palamedes was also member of the expedition against Troy. Becoming obnoxious to some of the leaders, he was falsely
accused of treachery and stoned to death, exclaiming: ‘ Truth, I lament thee,
for thou has died even before me.” Inhis A Apology Socrates expresses pleasure
at the prospect of meeting in the other world with Palamedes and other heroes
of old, who had died by unrighteous judgment, and of examining those who, like
Nestor, had been renowned for wisdom.

<note n="25"/> Aristippus: 435-350 B.C. Founder of the Cyrenaic school of philosophy; a
disciple of Socrates, but departed widely from the teachings and practice of his
master, being luxurious in mode of life. He is said to have been the first amon
the followers of Socrates to take money for ing. A part of his life he passe

<note n="26"/> Plato: A native of Athens, 429-847 B. C., and devoted follower of Socrates.
He taught in the gymnasium and olive groves of the Academy, in the northwestern suburb of Athens. Menippus does not correctly represent Plato's relations with the tyrants of Sicily. While there for purposes of sightseeing, he was
introduced by Dion to the elder Dionysius, who took offense at the plain talk of
his guest, and subjected him to the greatest indignities and even sought to kill
him, if we may credit Diodorus and Plutarch. Subsequently, at the invitation of
the younger Dionysius, and urged by Dion, he revisited Sicily, in the hope of
persuading the tyrant to adopt his theories of government and education. At
first he was received with universal enthusiasm; but owing to the intrigues of
the conservative party, Dionysius, after keeping him awhile in a sort of semicaptivity, permitted him to depart, with the understanding that he would make
the despot another visit. During this third visit he was treated in the same way,
and his friends with difficulty got him back to Athens alive. Cf. Parasite, 34.

<p><label>Socrates</label> But what do people think about me?</p>

<p><label>Menippus</label> You are a fortunate man, Socrates, at least
in this regard. At any rate, all think that you were a
wonderful man, and knew everything, and that, though
you didn’t know anything—for, I suppose I must speak
the truth.</p>

<p><label>Socrates</label> Why, I myself used totell them so. But they
thought my ignorance was all a pretense.</p>

<p><label>Menippus</label> But who are these people around you?</p>

<p><label>Socrates</label> Charmides,<ref n="27"/> Menippus, and Phaedrus<ref n="28"/>  and the

esteem either.</p>

Croesus and Sardanapalus, with the view of establishing myself in their neighborhood. At all events, it

he seemed to be approaching with his countenance perfectly calm; apparently he was not at all afraid of death
and wanted to show this to those who stood outside the

the yawning gulf and saw the nether darkness, and
when I in aid of the hemlock, bit him, as he still de-

to cry just like a baby, and mourned for his own

else. Yes, our beau idéal of a ghost conductor has

you see, bringing us quite a goodly number, or rather
wita his wand scaring them on, huddled together like a
herd of goats. But what means this? I see one among
them in fetters, and another laugbing, and one in particular with a wallet hanging to him, and holding a
cudgel in his hand, fiercely eying the rest and urging
them forward. And don’t you see, too, how Hermes
himself is dripping with sweat, and his feet covered
with dust, and how he’s puffing and blowing? At any

<p><label>Hermes</label> Matter, Clotho! Why, nothing else than
the fact that this reprobate here ran away, and in chasing after him I to-day came within an ace of being a

<p><label>Clotho</label> But who is he, and what object had he in
running off?</p>

<p><label>Hermes</label> Oh, that’s as plain as a pikestaff—it was because he wanted to live longer. He’s some king, or
tyrant—at least, I infer so from his lamentations, and
from the theme of his loud wailing, for he says he has
been deprived of great good fortune of some sort.</p>

Why, had not that most noble fellow yonder—he with

ever since Atropos<ref n="9"/>  put him in my charge, he kept resisting all the way, and holding back, and set his feet
firmly against the ground, so that it wasn’t an easy
matter at all to bring him along. And every now and

then he resorted to prayers and earnest entreaty, demanding to be set free for a little while, and promising
to reward me abundantly. But, of course, I didn’t let
him go, as I saw that he wished for what was impossible. But when we were just atthe very entrance, on
my taking an inventory of the dead for Aeacus,<ref n="10"/> as is
my wont, while he compared them with the tally-sheet
your sister sent him, somehow or other this thriceaccursed wretch got off unnoticed. So, by the count
one dead man proved to be missing. At this Aeacus
drew up hiseyebrows. “Hermes,” says he, “don’t persist in practicing upon all occasions your thievish propensity. ’Tis enough for you to play your childish
pranks up above. But.the accounts pertaining to
the dead are kept with scrupulous exactness and cannot
possibly escape our notice. The check list, as you see,
has one thousand and four names recorded upon it,
whereas here you are with one short of the required
number for me, unless you enter the plea that Atropos
has cheated you.” At this speech I turned as red as a
lobster, but instantly bethought myself of what had
happened while en route. And when, upon looking
around, I saw this rascal nowhere, I perceived that he
had given me the slip, and pursued him at the top of
my speed along the road that leads to the light. And
this best-of-fellows<ref n="11"/>  here followed of his own motion;
and by running as if from the starting line<ref n="12"/>  of a race-course, we overtook him just at Taenarus<ref n="13"/> —go near did

yesterday in battle in Mysia, and among them Gobares,

parents exposing infants whom they were unable or unwilling to rear. In Athens
it was done by the father; in Sparta by the State in the case of the physically
incapable. Plato recommends the practice in his ideal state. Aristotle maintains that there should be a law against rearing a cripple.

her paramour?</p>

by robbers—where are they, Hermes?</p>

wounds—as you perceive. And the women, will you
have me bring them forward at one and the same time?</p>

<p><label>Clotho</label> Certainly! And along with them, those
who have suffered shipwreck, for they died in similar
fashion. And those who died of fever, bring them forward at the same time, and Agathocles, their physician,

<p><label>Cyniscus</label> I’ve been standing near you this long

my spindle to run on until the thread was almost spun

Pll come back soon of my own accord, without anybody

<p><label>Clotho</label> But why do you want to return?</p>

<p><label>Megapenthes</label> Suffer me first to finish my house. I left it
half done.</p>

<p><label>Clotho</label> What nonsense! But get on board!</p>

<p><label>Megapenthes</label> It isn’t a long respite that I ask for, O goddess of fate. Permit me to stay this one day, until I
give some directions to my wife about the property,
and tell her where I had my great treasure buried.</p>

<p><label>Clotho</label> ’Tis allsettled. You would notaccomplish
your purpose.</p>

<p><label>Megapenthes</label> Will, then, the gold treasure that I amassed
in such quantity be utterly lost?</p>

<p><label>Clotho</label> Oh, no, not lost. You need give yourself
no concern on that score at least. Your cousin, Megacles, will inherit it.</p>

<p><label>Megapenthes</label> Oh, what an outrage! Is my enemy to have
it, whom I failed to kill off beforehand, only because of
my easy-going temper?</p>

<p><label>Clotho</label> Yes, the very man! and he’ll survive you
forty years and more, after inheriting your mistresses
and wardrobe and all that gold of yours.</p>

<p><label>Megapenthes</label> It’s a piece of injustice on your part, Clotho—
this distributing my property among my greatest
enemies.</p>

<p><label>Clotho</label> What! Didn’t you take possession of it,
when it belonged to Cydimachus, most noble Sir, after
you had both killed him and butchered his children
upon him, while the breath of life was still in his body?</p>

<p><label>Megapenthes</label> Yes, but now it was mine.</p>

to have it has already expired.</p>

<p><label>Megapenthes</label> Listen, Clotho! I want to say something to
you in private without any one hearing.—You_ people
here stand one side for a moment! (Confidentially to
Clotho). Now, if you’ll let me slip off, I promise to
give you to-day a thousand talents in gold coin.</p>

<p><label>Clotho</label> What! You ridiculous fellow! Have you
still got gold and talents on the brain?</p>

<p><label>Megapenthes</label> Yes. and the two bowls, which I took when

<p>I killed Cleocritus—would you have me give you them
also? They each weigh a hundred talents of refined

that he won’t embark for us of his own accord.</p>

<p><label>Megapenthes</label> (Turning to the bystanders.) I call you to
witness—the city wall remains unfinished and the
dockyards. I should have completed them had I lived
only five days more.</p>

<p><label>Clotho</label> Never mind! Somebody else will build the
wall.</p>

a perfectly reasonable one, too.</p>

<p><label>Clotho</label> ‘Well, what is it?</p>

<p><label>Megapenthes</label> That I may survive until I bring the Persians
under my sway and levy tribute upon the Lydians, and
until I erect acolossal monument for myself and inscribe thereon the great deeds of generalship I performed during my life.</p>

you might leave him behind upon the earth?</p>

<p><label>Megapenthes</label> Yes, that was my prayer in days of yore; but
now I see what is better.</p>

<p><label>Clotho</label> Well, he too, let me tell you, will be here

has lately become king.</p>

after I’m gone.</p>

<p><label>Clotho</label> Well, listen! You'll be distressed yet
more, when you know the story. Your slave, Midas,
is going to have your wife. Yes, long ago he used to
carry on his intrigues with her.</p>

<p><label>Clotho</label> And your daughter, let me tell you, is
going to be numbered among the concubines of the
present ruler. Yes, and the images and statues which
the city in days gene by set up in your honor, will all
be overturned and become, I presume, a laughing-stock
to those who behold them.</p>

<p><label>Megapenthes</label> Tell me! Is noone of my friends indignant
at such doings?</p>

<p><label>Clotho</label> Why, who was a friend of yours? Or what
reason had any onefor becoming yourfriend? Are you
not aware that all who were wont to pay you homage
and applaud all your sayings and doings did so from
fear or hope, out of love for power and with an eye
to their own profit?</p>

<p><label>Megapenthes</label> And yet, when making their drink offerings
at the banquets, with loud voice they used to invoke
many blessings upon me; and each of them professed a
readiness to die for me, if that were possible. In short,
they were in the habit of swearing by me.</p>

<p><label>Clotho</label> Yes, and it was after dining with one of
them yesterday that you came to your death. The
last thing that was brought in for you to drink—that
sent you down here.</p>

<p><label>Megapenthes</label> Well, as to that, I did taste something bitter.
But with what intent did the fellow do it?</p>

<p><label>Clotho</label> Come! You keepasking meso many questions, when you ought to have gone on board.</p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="12">
<p><label>Megapenthes</label> There’s one thing, Clotho, that especially
vexes me, on account of which I was anxious to pop up
into the light again just for a little while.</p>

<p><label>Clotho</label> And what’s that? You look as though it
were something extraordinary.</p>

<p><label>Megapenthes</label> My steward, Carion, the moment he saw I
was dead, toward evening went up into the chamber
where I was lying, and improving the opportunity—
for nobody was keeping guard over me—he brought in
my concubine, the darling Glycera—they had carried
on their liaisons of old, I presume—and pulling the door
to, he made love to her, just as though there was
nobody within; and then, looking at me—“You brute
of a fellow, you!’ says he, “you gave me a flogging
many a time when I did nothing wrong.” As he said
<pb n="p.182"/>

this, he plucked out my hair and struck me upon the
temple; and finally, after coughing loudly and spitting
upon me, ‘he departed, adding these words: “Get you
gone to where the ungodly dwell !”—I was on fire with
rage, but for all that, I could do nothing to him, for I
was already exhausted and in the chill of death.
Yes, and the foul jade, when she heard the sound of
persons approaching, smeared her eyes with spittle, as
though she had been weeping over me, and went off
shrieking and calling my name. If I could only get
hold of them, I’d——

upon a man who is a king?</p>

<p><label>Clotho</label> No one, upon a king, but Rhadamanthus
will, upon a dead man. You’ll see him present]ly—he’s
very just and punishes each one according to his
deserts. Don’t persist in delaying the business we now

daily bread, a slave even, instead of the king I once
was; but suffer me to return to life—that’s all I ask.</p>

had a bodyguard of ten thousand spearmen.</p>

plucked out your hair?—you look so disfigured. Anyhow, bitter will be the thought of your kingly rank,

<p>Anyhow, be it the first or the last course, it’s the
same teeth that await it. Besides, I’m quite differently
situated from the rich. For the lives of us poor folks
are, as the saying has it, diametrically opposite to
theirs. This tyrant here, who was seemingly happy
during his lifetime, an object of fear to all and admired
of all observers, and who left behind him such a quantity of gold and silver, wearing apparel, horses, dinners,
blooming children and comely wives, had good reason
to be grieved and distressed at being torn away from
them. Somehow or other the soul becomes attached to
such objects by a sort of glue, so to speak, and cannot
easily quit its hold, because it has clung to them so

a gift in pledge of hospitality.

long. Or rather, the chain, with which these people
have come to be bound, is, as it were, quite incapable
of being broken. Of course, if one carry them off by
force, they utter loud lamentations and beg hard; and
while in other respects they do not want for courage,
as regards the road that leads to the nether world they
prove arrant cowards, Atall events they turn about
and look back, and like those who are desperately in
love, they would fain gaze steadfastly, even from afar,
at what they have left behind in the world of light, just
as that fool there was doing, even trying to escape while
enroute, and here plying you with his entreaties.</p>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="15">
<p>But I, because I had nothing to tie me to life—no
estates, no houses, no gold, no furniture, no glory, no
statues—naturally enough I was all ready to start off;
and when Atropos only nodded to me, I gladly threw
aside my knife and the sole I was stitching—for I had
a boot in my hands—and jumping up at once, all barefoot as I was, and even without having washed off of
me the black stains of the leather, I followed along, or
rather I led the way, with my eyes directed forward.
For none of the things behind turned me about or
called me back. Yea, by Zeus, to my eyes already, all
the ways in vogue with you people here are just elegant.
For to me at least it seems ever so nice to find all upon
an equality of privilege and nobody better than his
neighbor. I infer that debtors don’t even get dunned
here, and nobody pays taxes, and what’s of most consequence, people don’t shiver with the cold or suffer
from disease, nor are they beaten by the more powerful.

among goddesses! When upon earth, I lived next door
to a tyrant and used to observe very closely how things
went with him. At that time I thought him about
equal toa god. For I pronounced him happy, when I
beheld the brilliancy of the purple he wore, the crowd

of attendants about him, the gold, the beakers set
with precious stones, and the divans with their legs of
silver, Nay, more, the savory odor of the viands, as
they were being cooked for his dinner fairly wore me
out; so that he actually seemed to me to be a sort of
superhuman person and thrice happy; yes, and all but
handsomer than anybody else, and taller by a whole
royal cubit, as he strode along with pompous air, elated
at his good fortune, throwing his head back haughtily,
and striking with awe all who met him. But when he
was dead, the man himself seemed to me thoroughly
ridiculous, now that he had stripped off his luxury; and
still more did I laugh at my own self, such a reprobate
had I been admiring, inferring his good fortune from the
savory odors that came from his kitchen, and deeming
him happy because he regaled himself with the blood of
the snails caught in the Laconian sea.<ref n="22"/> </p>

to the spendthrift, Rhodochares—this fellow, you know,
was next of kin to him, and legally the first one to be
cited to receive the inheritance. In his case, too, I
could not possibly stop laughing, especially when I recalled how pale and slovenly he always was, how his
forehead was all wrinkled with care, and how he was
rich with his fingers alone, with which he used to count
talents, even tens of thousands of them, that he was
accumulating little by little, to be soon squandered by

<note n="31"/> Rhadamanthus: Son of Zeus. Minos, Aeacus and himself constituted tbe
tribunal before which every soul, on entering the lower world, had to appear.
Minos was chief-justice, to whom appéal was made in cases of doubt.

<note n="32"/> Examine by the marks upon you: See Plato’s Gorgias, 523 ff., where
Socrates is represented as setting forth his views concerning the fate of the
dead. By the law of Cronus, he who has lived a life of justice and holiness shall
go to the Isles of the Blest (placed by the later Greeks in the ocean far to the
west), while the unjust and impious shall go to the house of punishment, called
Tartarus. At first judgment was rendered on the very day upon which a man
was todie. But Pluto and the authorities of the Isles of the Blest complained to
Zeus that the souls were finding their way to the wrong pieces accurate judgment not being given, because both the souls of the judges and of the judged
were still clothed with their bodies, which formed, as it were, a veil before the
soul, often making it impossible to diagnose its realcharacter. Accordingly it
was ordered that judgment should take place after death, when the souls of both
the judged and of the judge were stripped of their vesture. Thus the naked soul
of the latter would be enabled to pierce into the naked soul of the former and
render a just decision as to its fate. When at death body and soul part comany, they each retain their characteristics, which are much the same as in life.
When the soul is divested of the body all its natural or acquired affections are
laid open to view. Rhadamanthus inspects the soul of each one, not knowing
whose it is. But oftentimes, when he lays hold upon the Great King, or some
other prince or potentate, he perceives no soundness in his soul, but finds that it
has been subjected to a severe scourging, and is full of scars made by Berens
and wrongdoing, which each one’s own conduct has stamped upon his soul, and
is all crooked from falsehood and bragging, and nothing is straight, because he
has lived without truth. So the judge sees the soul full of deformity and stained with license and luxury and insolence and incontinence, and dispatches it ignominiously to its prison, and there it undergoes.the punishment it deserves.</p>

<p>Apropos of a letter written to the Senate by the Emperor Tiberius, describing
the utter misery and remorse of mind which had come upon him as a penalty for
his crimes and infamies, Tacitus remarks: 

<cit>
    <quote>Not without reason was the man
        most distinguished for wisdom (Socrates) wont to declare that, were the minds
        of kings to be laid open, there could be seen lacerations and wounds; for just as
        the body is mangled by whips, so by cruelty, by lust and by evil devices is the
        soul lacerated. Indeed, neither outward Present. nor living in solitude could
        save Tiberius from the necessity of confessing his tortures of soul and from the
        retribution he had brought upon himself.</quote>

<p><label>Cyniscus</label> Why, how did I become a branded culprit?</p>

<p><label>Rhadamanthus</label> Whatever evil deeds any one of you has
done during his life, he carries about upon his soul invisible marks of every single one of them.</p>

<p><label>Cyniscus</label> There! I stand before you stripped, as you
direct. Now then, search out those marks you speak
of.</p>

<p><label>Rhadamanthus</label> (Making examination.) Well, this man
here is upon the whole without blemish, except these
three or four scars that are quite faint and indistinct,
But what means this? There are many traces and indications of the brands; but somehow or other they
have been obliterated, or rather cut out. How comes
that, Cyniscus? How is it that you have proved to be
without spot again?</p>

<p><label>Cyniscus</label> Well, Pll tell you. In my younger days I
became bad through ignorance, and thereby earned for
myself many marks. But just as soon as I began to
devote myself to philosophy, little by little I washed off
all the stains from my soul by the use of this remedy,
so good indeed and highly effectual was it.</p>

<p><label>Rhadamanthus</label> Well, my friend, you may go to the Isles of

speak of. Now, Hermes, call up some more! (Micyllus steps forward.)</p>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="26">
<p><label>Cyniscus</label> It were entirely unnecessary to say anything at all. For you’ll find out right here and now
what sort of a fellow he is, from the brands upon him.
But for all that, I will myself tear aside the veil and
expose the man to your view more clearly by means of
speech also. However, I think Pll pass over what this
thrice-accursed wretch here did as a private citizen.
But when, associating with himself the boldest spirits
and having got together a lot of spearmen, he rose in
revolt against the city and established himself as
despot, he put to death more than ten thousand without
trial. Confiscating the property of each of them, and
having thus become immensely rich, he neglected no
form of excess and practiced all manner of cruelty and
wanton violence upon the miserable citizens. He
seduced maidens, dishonored youth, and in every way
behaved toward his subjects like one drunken. Indeed,
you could not possibly punish him according to his
deserts for his arrogance and conceit and his insolence
toward those who met him. Why, it would have
been easier for one to look at the sun without winking,
than at him. Nay, more, who could describe the unheard-of cruelty, of the punishments, which he invented? Indeed he spared not even his nearest of kin.
And that this is no mere empty slander against him,
you’ll soon find out, when you have summoned those
whom he has murdered. Or rather, as you see, they
are present unbidden and, standing round about, are trying to choke him. All these people, Rhadamanthus,
have died at the hands of this old sinner. : Some were
the objects of his plots on account of their handsome

wives; some were put to death because they were indignant, when their sons were taken away to gratify
his lust; and others, because of their wealth; and others
still, because they were shrewd, sensible men, and not
at all pleased with his doings.</p>

he even turned prophet and foretold future events, and
was thought to be doing nothing paradoxical; nor did
the hearer invoke the Defender-from-evil, as you did,
because, forsooth, he fancied that what he heard was to
be deprecated. And, indeed, what would you have
done, if the keel of the Argo<ref n="3"/>  had spoken to you, or

to master the language of men without difficulty. But
if you were to promise me to hold your tongue, I
shouldn’t hesitate to tell you the truer cause of my
speaking the same language with you and whence I
derive the ability to talk in such wise.</p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="3">
<p><label>Micyllus</label> But this, too, isn’t a dream, is it—a cock
conversing with mein this fashion? Be thatas it may,
in the name of Hermes, do tell me, my dear friend,
just what else is the cause of your ability to speak!
Why should you have misgivings about my keeping
mum and that I will tell somebody? For who would
believe me, if I should relate something, with the
assertion that I had heard a cock tell it?</p>

<p><label>Cock</label> Well, then, Micyllus, listen! I well know
that I am making a statement: that is most incredible
to you. For this creature here, who now seems to you
a cock, not long since was a man.</p>

<p><label>Micyllus</label> Of course, I long ago heard some such thing
about your tribe—how a youth named Alectryon (Cock)
became a friend of Ares, drank with the god, was a
boon companion of his in merrymaking, and shared in
his love affairs. And when, for instance, Ares<ref n="6"/>  sallied
forth to the apartments of Aphrodite to play the gay
Lothario, he took Alectryon also along with him, and
—as he was especially suspicious of Helios, lest he
should observe what was going on and tell Hephaestus
—he always left the young man outside near the door,
so as to give the signal when Helios should rise.
Then, so the story goes on to relate, Alectryon on one
occasion slept through and unwittingly abandoned his
watch, and Helios, without being observed, stood near
Aphrodite and Ares while wrapped in slumber, because
they took it for granted that Alectryon would sound the
alarm if any one approached. And Hephaestus, having
thus learned of the affair from Helios, made them fast
by throwing chains around them, which he had made
for them long before, and so caught them as in a net.
But Ares, when let go—as was the case—was angry
with Alectryon and changed him into this fowl here—

<note n="6"/>  Ares: God of war. The account of his amour with Aphrodite  (goddess of
love) in Od, viii., 266 ff., furnished the basis of the story here given.
<pb n="p.197"/>

arms and all—so that he still retains upon his head the
helmet crest. And, therefore, by way of apology to
Ares—though there’s no use in it—you, cocks, when
you see Helios about coming up, crow a long time
before, to give notice of his rising.</p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="4">
<p><label>Cock</label> Yes; people do tell that story also, Micyllus. But my case is quite different; you’ll find I’ve
changed into a cock very recently.</p>

<p><label>Micyllus</label> And how was it? For that’s what I’m especially desirous of knowing.</p>

<p><label>Cock</label> Well, have you heard of a certain Pythagoras,<ref n="7"/> son of Mnesarchus, of Samos?</p>

<p><label>Micyllus</label> You refer, I suppose, to the sophist, the
quack, who forbade by law to taste flesh, or eat beans,
banishing from the tablea most delicious relish—to my
notion at least. And furthermore, he persuaded people
that he had been Euphorbus,<ref n="8"/> before he became Pythagoras. They say, O Cock, that the man was also a
sorcerer and wonder worker.</p>

<p><label>Cock</label> Well, I’m myself the famous Pythagoras,
you’ll find. So, my good man, stop railing at me, especially as you don’t know just what sort of a person I
was for character.</p>

<p><label>Micyllus</label> Why, this story, I repeat, is far more marvelous than the other. Good heavens! A cock, a philosopher! But for all that, tell me, son of Mnesarchus,
how it was you came to appear as a bird with us, instead of a man, and from Tanagra<ref n="9"/>  instead of Samos.
For that is not probable, or very easy to believe, as I
think [ve already observed in you at least two characteristics quite foreign to Pythagoras.</p>

<p><label>Cock</label> Well, what are they?</p>

<p><label>Micyllus</label> One, that you are garrulous and noisy,
whereas he, I think, used to exhort people to remain
silent for five whole years; and the other is indeed a
direct violation of law. For I had come home yesterday without the wherewithal to set before you, but with
beans only, as you are aware, and you made no bones

of gobbling them up. It must be, therefore, that you’ve
told a lie and are somebody else, or, if you are Pythagoras, that you’ve acted unlawfully and committed
sacrilege in eating beans.</p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="5">
<p><label>Cock</label> No wonder you think so, Micyllus, for
you don’t understand the rationale of these things or
what is adapted toeach kind of life. I didn’t eat beans
at that time, for I was a philosopher; but now I may
eat them, for this food is for fowls and not forbidden
us. If, however, it is agreeable to you, hear how it
is, that, after having been Pythagoras, I am now, what
you see before you, and in what states of being I formerly lived and what enjoyment I have derived from
each transmigration.</p>

<p><label>Micyllus</label> Say on! For to me at least the tale would ba
fascinating beyond measure. Why, if somebody should
set before me the choice, whether I would rather hear
you relate such adventures, or behold again that superlatively happy dream that I had a little while ago, I
don’t know which I should choose, so exactly like the
things that seem most charming do I regard your experiences; and both of you I hold in equal honor—you
yourself and my highly-prized dream.</p>

<p><label>Cock</label> What! Are you still conning over your
dream—whatever it was that appeared to you—and intently watching rather unsubstantial shapes, chasing
in memory an empty and, to quotea word from the
poets, a pretty “fleeting” happiness?</p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="6">
<p><label>Micyllus</label> But, be assured, O Cock, I shall never
forget that vision. So abundant is the honey that the

what sort of a thing it is, since you have such an intense yearning after it.</p>

<p><label>Micyllus</label> Well, I’m ready to tell you. Indeed, I shall
be delighted to recall it to mind and give a somewhat
circumstantial account of it. But, my dear Pythagoras,
when are you going to relate the story of your transmigrations?</p>

<p><label>Cock</label> When you, Micyllus, stop your dreaming
and wipe off the honey from your eyelids. But, as it
is, do you have your say first, that I may learn whether
the dream was sent by way of the ivory gates, or
through those of horn.</p>

<p><label>Micyllus</label> Not through either of them, Pythagoras.</p>

    <p><label>Cock</label> And yet Homer declares there are only those
two.<ref n="11"/> </p>

<p><label>Micyllus</label> Have done with that silly poet, for he doesn’t
know anything about dreams. The flimsy dreams
such as he saw—though not very clearly, for he himself was blind, you know—perhaps they came forth by
way of such gates. But my dream—the most bewitching of all—came through a sort of golden doorway, and
was itself composed of gold and draped entirely in gold,
and brought a quantity of gold along with it.</p>

<p><label>Cock</label> Cease talking of gold, my dear friend Midas,<ref n="12"/>

may learn at once what sort of athing it was. You
remember I didn’t dine at home yesterday; for Eucrates,
the millionaire, met me in the market-place and bade
me be on hand and dine with’ him at the appointed
hour, having first taken a bath.</p>

in with Eucrates. After saluting him as “my lord,”
according to my custom, I was on the point of taking
my leave, lest I should mortify the man by keeping
company with him in my seedy attire, when says he,
“To-day, Micyllus, I celebrate the anniversary of my
daughter’s birth with a banquet, and I’ve invited in
very many of our friends. But it’s reported that one
of them is on the sick list and cannot dine with us.
So, do you make your toilet and be present in his place,
unless, indeed, upon a second invitation, he should say
that he will be on hand—which now at least is doubtful.” On hearing this I made my bow and departed,
beseeching all the gods to send chills and fever, pleurisy, or an attack of the gout upon the guest who was
under the weather, whose alternate and substitute at
dinner and successor I had been invited to be. The
time until the hour for bathing seemed an eternity, and
I kept my eyes fixed intently upon the sundial to see
how long the shadow of the gnomon was and when at
length it would be necessary to take my bath. When
at last the proper time arrived, having quickly made
my toilet, I set forth quite decently clad, having turned
my cloak that my dress might have its legs soiled part
outside.</p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="10">
<p rend="merge">I find at the door many other guests, and
even him too—borne upon a litter by four men—in
whose stead I was to dine, and who was said to besick.
And indeed he evidently was badly off. At any rate,
he kept up a low moaning, and had arather deep-seated
cough, and hawked and spit, so one couldn’t go near
him. He was pale as a ghost and bloated, and about
sixty years old. He was said to bea sort of philosopher—one of that class who talk nonsense to the youth.
Anyhow, his beard was very like that of a gout and
greatly in need of being trimmed. On being taken to
task by Doctor Archibius for venturing out in sucha
state of health, he replied: “One ought not to prove
false to duty, especially if he isa philosopher, though
countless infirmities stand inhis way. Why, Eucrates
will think I didn’t care a straw for him.” “No indeed!’ said I. “On the contrary, he will commend
you, if you prefer to depart this life at home by your-

self, rather than in the banquet hall, coughing up your
immortal spirit<ref n="15"/>  along with the phlegm.” Out of
pride, I suppose, he pretended not to have heard my
jest. After a little, Hucrates, having finished his toilet,
appears upon the scene, and seeing Thesmopolis—for
that was our philosopher’s name—“Professor,” says
he, ‘I appreciate your good will in being present in
person at my house; but even had you stayed away,
you wouldn’t have lost anything, for all the courses
would have been sent you in their order.’? With these
words he passed in, leading Thesmopolis by the hand,
who was also supported by the servants.</p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="11">
<p rend="merge">I accordingly was getting ready to leave, when my host
turned around and was for some time at a loss what
to do. But when he saw that I was very much out of
sorts, he said—“And do you also, Micyllus, stay and
dine with us. I will direct my son to eat with his
mother in the women’s apartment, in order that you
may have aplace.” So in I went, having come within
an ace of posing as a wolf<ref n="16"/>  who opens his mouth for
nothing,” and mortified because I thought I had turned
my host’s son out of the banquet hall. When it came
time to take our seats at the festive board, in the
first place some strapping young fellows — five, I
think—with much ado, I assure you, lifted Thesmopolis up and deposited him in his chair, stuffing
in pillows all around him, that he might maintain his
position and be able to hold out a long time. Then, as
nobody was inclined to sit near him, they unceremoniously put me in the seat next below his, that we might
be table companions. Dinner, Pythagoras, immediately followed—a rather sumptuous repast, with a profusion of viands, served upon an abundance of gold
and silver plate. There were beakers of gold, servants
in the bloom of youth, and singing girls and buffoons
between-whiles. In a word, the entertainment was delightful in the extreme. One thing, however, vexed
me beyond measure. Thesmopolis made a regular
nuisance of himself, spinning a long yarn about “virtue”

an affirmative, and that it is not night when it is day;
and every now and then he even declared I had horns.<ref n="17"/> 
Though I didn’t care a straw for them, he kept on indulging in a lot of such speculations, and so spoiled my
pleasure by not permitting me to listen to the players
and singers. Such, my dear Chanticleer, was the
dinner.</p>

<p><label>Cock</label> Not very delightful after all, Micyllus, especially as you were allotted a seat near that old fool!</p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="12">
<p><label>Micyllus</label> Well, listen now to my dream also, I
imagined that Eucrates had no children himself, and
now lay at death’s door—I know not how it came about
—and that he then called me to him, made his will, in
which I was constituted heir of all his property, and
soon after died. Then, in my dream, having come
into possession of the estate, I drew off in pretty large
tubs the gold and the silver, which poured into them in
an ever-flowing and abundant stream; and the other
things—the wardrobe, tables, drinking cups, and the
menials—were all mine, of course. Then I rode out in
a carriage with a span of white horses, with my head
proudly thrown back, the cynosure of all eyes, and the
object of their envy. A crowd ran ahead, or led the
way on horseback, and more tagged on behind. Clad
in the old gentleman’s clothing, and wearing some sixteen massive rings upon my fingers, I was ordering a
pretty splendid banquet to be prepared for the entertainment of my friends. Ags is natural enough in a
dream, you know, they were on hand in a trice, and
the dinner was presently brought in and the drink compounded. Just as I was in the midst of all this, and
drinking healths in golden bowls to each of my guests,
at the very moment the cake was being brought in, you
inopportunely set up a crowing, and to our loss turned
the symposium topsy-turvy, tipped over the tables,
scattered that wealth of mine and caused it to be borne
away on the wings of the wind. Don’t you_think,
then, I’ve good reason to be vexed with you? Had my
dream appeared to me three nights in succession, I
should still have looked upon it with delight.

whom this is true; nay, you yourself also, when you
were Euphorbus,<ref n="18"/> fastened ornaments of gold and silver
in your locks, and thus tricked out you went into battle
with the Achaians. Although in the midst of the
combat, where it was better to be ironclad rather than
wear gold, yet even then you thought fit to contend,
with your tresses tied up with gold. And in my opinion, it was fcr this, that Homer said your locks were

when entwined with the gold also and shining forth
along with it. And yet, my friend with the golden
ornaments in your hair, if youdid prize gold, your

nothing more lovely into which he might transform

into gold, and streaming down through the roof, embraced his Dulcinea, Why, then, should I go on to
tell you, in the next place, what uses gold subserves—
that it makes those who have it beautiful, wise and

customs and manner of life that the multitude follow
I should utterly fail to induce men to admire me; but
the more eccentric I showed myself, in so much the

Therefore I chose to introduce new-fangled notions, representing the rationale of them as secret, in order that,
one conjecturing one thing, another another—all might
be astonished, just as at the baffling replies of the oracles. D’ye see? You, too, now, in your turn, are

carded wool and spun thread, and played the woman

Became a philosopher after being a hetzra!</p>

<p><label>Cock</label> Yes, and then a king, then a poor man, and
after a little a satrap, and then a horse, jackdaw, and
frog, and other things without number. It would be
tedious to enumerate them all in detail. And last of
all, [repeatedly became a cock; for I was charmed with
that sort of life, and have been in the service of many
different persons—kings, poor men, and rich; and to
end up, I am now with you, every day laughing at you

whine over your poverty, and admire the rich through

<p><label>Cock</label> It will make no difference, whether you address me as Euphorbus, Pythagoras, Aspasia or as

war, if the report come, that the enemy are approaching. Nor are you anxious, lest in their incursions they
lay waste your farm, or trample your park underfoot,
or cut down your vines; but on hearing the trumpet,
you have only to look out for yourself—if in sooth it
comes to that—and providea refuge where you can save
yourself and avoid the danger. Whereas, the rich both
have to look out for their own personal safety and are
distressed, as they see from their walls all the property
plundered, which they had upon their estates. And if
it be necessary to pay a special property tax, they alone
are called upon; and if to go out against the foe, they
bear the brunt of battle as generals, or as commanders
of cavalry. Whereas, you have a shield of osier and
are well equipped with reference to safety, and free from
incumbrances and are ready to feast in honor of victory, when the commander in chief offers up sacrifices
for the triumph he has won.</p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="22">
<p rend="merge">In time of peace, on
the other hand, you, as one of the commons, will go up
to the public assembly and play the tyrant over the
rich, while they shake in their shoes and cower down
and try to win your favor by meansof largesses. Why,
they labor that you may have bathhouses, public
games, and spectacular shows, and all the other luxuries
to your heart’s content. Whereas you inquire rigidly
into their conduct of affairs and subject them to a cruel
scrutiny,<ref n="48"/> as though you were their master, sometimes
not even allowing them an opportunity to explain matters. And if you take a notion to, you pelt them with
a shower of stones like hail, and confiscate their possessions. Then, too, you yourself have no fear of a false
accuser, or that some robber will scale the eaves or dig
through the wall of your house and purloin your gold.
You are not bothered with computing interest, making
collections, or on account of squabbles with cursed

<p><label>Micyllus</label> But, tell me, my dear Chanticleer, when
you were a king—for you say you once even sat on a

Were you really altogether happy in possessing the
climax, whatever it is, of all good things?</p>

<p><label>Cock</label> Don’t even remind me of it, Micyllus, so

<p><label>Micyllus</label> And what were they? For what you say is
paradoxical and not altogether credible.</p>

<p><label>Cock</label> Well, I was sovereign of no small country,
Micyllus, prolific in pretty much everything. As to
population and the beauty of its cities, it was among
those most worthy of admiration, with navigable rivers
flowing through it and having the use of a sea with
good harbors. I hada largearmy, an organized force of
cavalry, a considerable bodyguard, ships of war, an
incalculable amount of money and no end of gold plate,
with all the other paraphernalia of royalty splendid in
the extreme; so that when I appeared in public, the
multitude were wont to pay me homage and thought
they were looking upon a sort of god, and flocked together crowding one upon another in order to see me.
Some even clambered upon the roofs and regarded it as
a great privilege to get a good view of my carriage, mantle and diadem, and of those who went ahead in the
procession or followed on behind. But I knew all the
time what things were harassing and torturing me, and
so I excused those people on the score of their ignorance; while I pitied myself, resembling, as I did, those

fashioned. A not inapt comparison; for each of these is
externally a Poseidon, or all-beautiful Zeus, wrought of
gold and ivory, and holding in his right hand a thunderbolt, lightning, or a trident. But if you stoop down
and look at what is within, you will see bars and bolts
and nails piercing it through and through, timbers and
wedges, pitch and mortar, and much unsightliness of
this sort lying hidden, not to mention a legion of rats
and mice that sometimes take up their abode in them.
Some such thing is even royalty.</p>

<p><label>Micyllus</label> But you haven’t yet explained what you
mean by the mortar and the bolts and bars, that belong to royal station, or what that mass of unsightly
stuff is. At least, as respects being stared at, when he
rides out, and ruling over so many people and being
worshiped like a god, a king really does bear some external resemblance to the colossal statues, to which you
liken him. For there’s something marvelous about
this also. But tell me at once what the things inside
the colossus represent.</p>

<p><label>Cock</label> Well, what shall I tell you first, Micyllus?
Shall I describe his fears, his apprehensions and suspicions, the hatred a king receives from those about him,
their machinations, and, too, the little sleep<ref n="54"/>  he gets because of these, and that only light, and his dreams full
of turmoil, his perplexities, and the forebodings of evil
ever present with him? Or, shall I tell you of his lack of
leisure, how he has to give audience to ambassadors,
administer justice, conduct military campaigns, issue
orders, make treaties and manage the finances? These
things make it impossible for him to have any pleasure
even in a dream; but he alone must take cognizance of
everything and have no end of trouble.

<p><label>Hermes</label> Indeed, Sir Ferryman, I haven’t the leisure, for I’m going away, charged by the Zeus above<ref n="5"/>

I’m in duty bound to be obliging. For, how can a fellow help himself, when one who is his friend constrains
him? However, Sir Ferryman, it is impossible for
you to inspect everything thoroughly one by one. It
would furnish serious employment for many years.
And then Zeus will find it necessary to advertise me as

<p><label>Hermes</label> Homer, the poet, says that the sons of Aloeus<ref n="10"/> 
—two like ourselves—when mere boys, sought once upon
a time to drag Ossa from its foundations and place it
upon Olympus, and then Pelion on top of that, thinking
that thus they would have a ladder adequate to scaling
the heavens. Those two lads, therefore, paid the penalty
of their presumption. But why do not we—for we are
not planning this with intent to harm the gods—why
do not we also, ourselves, build up an eminence in the
same way by piling mountains one on top of another,
that we may obtain a more accurate view from a higher
point?

<p><label>Charon</label> And can we too, by ourselves, Hermes,
remove Pelion or Ossa and set it upon Olympus?</p>

<p><label>Hermes</label> Why not, Charon? Do you expect we are
inferior to those two brats—and that, too, when we have
the advantage of being gods from the very cradle?</p>

<p><label>Charon</label> No! But in my opinion your plan involves
a stupendous amount of labor, that is quite impossible.</p>

made it possible for us to scale heaven in a moment, by
means of a distich, with such ease did he put the
mountains together. And I am surprised that this
seems a prodigious task to you, who, of course, know
about Atlas,<ref n="11"/> who by himself supports the very firmament and upholds us all. You have probably heard tell
of Heracles also, my brother, how he once on a time
took the place of that very Atlas and gave him a moment’s rest from his burden by assuming the load himself.</p>

<p><label>Charon</label> Yes; I have heard these stories also. But
you, Hermes, and the poets should know as to their
truth.</p>

<p><label>Hermes</label> Unquestionably true, Charon. For why
should wise men tell lies about it? So then, let us take
a crowbar and raise Ossa first just as our engineer in
his poem directs:

we have done it, and at the same time poetically. Now,

shines so, pale yellow with a rosy tint? From time out
of mind I have heard about it, but now for the first
time have I set eyes upon it.</p>

<p><label>Hermes</label> Yes, Charon, that is the famous thing, about
which men fight so much.</p>

<p><label>Charon</label> And yet I don’t see what good there is in it,
unless, forsooth, this be a sort of one only, that they
who carry it are oppressed by the weight.</p>

<p><label>Hermes</label> Why, don’t you know how many wars have
come about because of this, and plots, and robberies,
false oaths, and murders, and imprisonments, long voyages, commercial ventures, and enslavements?</p>

<p><label>Charon</label> Is it because, Hermes, it differs not much
from copper? For I am familiar with copper, since, as
you are aware, I collect an obol from every one who
makes the voyage down.

<pb n="p.232"/>
</p>

<p><label>Hermes</label> Yes; but copper is abundant. Therefore,
they don’t put a very high value upon it. But this they
dig up in small quantity by mining to a great depth.
Albeit this, too, comes from the ground just like lead
and the rest.</p>

<p><label>Charon</label> That’s a pretty appalling story of human
folly you tell, if men have such a passionate fondness
for a yellowish, burdensome piece of property.</p>

<p><label>Hermes</label> But at any rate, Solon there, Charon, does
not appear to be fond of it; for as you perceive, he is
laughing at Croesus, at the barbarian’s boastful pretensions; and I take it, he wants to ask him some question. Let us listen, therefore.<ref n="25"/> 

</p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="12">
<p><label>Solon</label> (Resuming.) Tell me, Croesus, think you
the Pythian has any need of these ingots?</p>

<p><label>Croesus</label> Yes, by Jingo! for he hasn’t got in Delphi
any such votive offering as this.</p>

<p><label>Solon</label> Do you, then, imagine that it will make the
god happy if he should have, along with his other offerings, gold ingots also?</p>

<p><label>Croesus</label> Why, how can it but be so.</p>

<p><label>Solon</label> According to what you tell me, Croesus, they
must be dreadfully poor in heaven, if they have to send
for gold from Lydia, in case they want it.</p>

<p><label>Croesus</label> Why, how could there be so much gold as
there is with us?</p>

<p><label>Solon</label> You have gold to be sure. But tell me, is iron
one of nature’s products in Lydia?</p>

<p><label>Croesus</label> No, not to any extent!</p>

<p><label>Solon</label> You, then, are lacking in the better metal.</p>

<p><label>Croesus</label> How is iron better than gold?</p>

<p><label>Solon</label> If you should answer questions without being
vexed, you would find out.</p>

<p><label>Croesus</label> Proceed with your inquiries, Solon.</p>

<p><label>Solon</label> Which are better, those who save people, or
those saved by them?</p>

<p><label>Croesus</label> They who save, of course.</p>

<p><label>Solon</label> If now, Cyrus, as certain newsmongers represent, should attack the Lydians, would you in that
case make sabers of gold for your army, or would iron
be indispensable then?

<note n="25"/> Let us listen: The following conversation is of Lucian's own invention.

<pb n="p.233"/>
</p>

<p><label>Croesus</label> Iron, undoubtedly.</p>

<p><label>Solon</label> And if indeed you shouldn’t provide this, your
gold would be gone as spoil for the Persians.</p>

<p><label>Croesus</label> (Getting excited.) You, sir, mind what you
say!</p>

<p><label>Solon</label> God forbid that such things should happen!
However, you clearly admit that iron is superior to gold.</p>

<p><label>Croesus</label> Would you then have me make even to the
god a votive offering of iron ingots and bring the gold
back again?</p>

<p><label>Solon</label> He, at any rate, will have no need even of
iron. But whether you make an offering of bronze or of
gold, you will have set it apart as a possession and
windfall at some time or other for somebody else—for
Phocians,<ref n="26"/> Boeotians, or the Delphians themselves, or
for some despot or robber; but the god will care little
for your goldsmiths.</p>

<p><label>Croesus</label> (Angrily.) You are all the time making
war upon my wealth and harboring envy. (Sardis

</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="13">
<p><label>Hermes</label> The Lydian, Charon, does not brook
the frankness with which Solon tells him the truth, but
thinks it an extraordinary procedure that a man who
hasn’t a farthing does not cower before him, but speaks
freely whatever comes into his head. However, he’ll
remember Solon by and by, when he himself has been
captured and he has to mount the funeral pyre<ref n="27"/>  by
Cyrus’ command. For I lately heard Clotho<ref n="28"/>  reading
aloud every man’s destiny, and in the list this, too,

<note n="26"/> Phocians, etc.: During the Sacred War (356—346 B. C.), the temple of Delphi
was despoiled of its treasures by the Phocian generals, in order to pay the mercenaries they had hired to enforce the ancient Phocian claim to the presidency
of the temple. Among the objects carried off were the splendid aie of Croesus 117 bricks of gold, 860 golden goblets, a female statue of gold; also seme of the
most precious heirlooms, such as the necklaces of Helen and Eriphyle. In these
successive spoliations the temple is said to have been robbed to the extent of
over $10,000,000.

<note n="27"/> Funeral pyre: When Cyrus the Great captured Sardis, the capital of Croesus,
he ordered the king to be burned alive pale a huge pyre. As Croesus stood in
chains upon the pyre, bethinking himself of what Solon once said to him, that
it cannot be told until the end comes, whether, or no, a man has lived a happy
life, he uttered thrice the name of Solon. Cyrus inquired whom he was invoking,
and was so impressed when he heard from the lips of Croesus what the lawgiver
had said, that he ordered the fire to be quenched. But it was too late; and the
king -vould have perished had he not appealed to Apollo on the score of the
presents he had given the Delphic oracle, to save him now. Immediately the fire
was extin iched by an abundant shower, and thereafter Croesus was made the
friend and counselor of Cyrus.

Cyrus, and that Cyrus himself would perish at the hand

<p><label>Charon</label> Yes, indeed, I do!</p>

head of Cyrus and is about to put it into a wineskin
full of blood. Do you see also his son, that young
man? Thatis Cambyses.<ref n="30"/>  He will behis father’s successor upon the throne, and, after meeting with numberless disasters in Libya and AXthiopia, at last will die
bereft of reason for having slain Apis.</p>

<p><label>Charon</label> How very ridiculous! But as the case now
stands who could bear to see them treat their fellowmen with such disdain? Or who could believe that,
after a little, the first is to be a captive and the second
is to have his head in a wineskin of blood.</p>

also, after being betrayed to Oroetes, the satrap, by Mzandrius his secretary, who stands near him, is fated to
be miserably deprived in a trice, of his good fortune
and to be fixed upon a stake. And this is sure to come
true, for I heard it from Clotho.</p>

<p><label>Charon</label> Wellsaid, Clotho! Give them a good toasting, my dear friend; cut off their heads and impale
them, that they may know they are but men. Meanwhile let them be exalted, for they will experience the
more pain in falling from a higher elevation. But I
shall chuckle, when I discover each of them in my little
skiff, stripped of everything, without either purple
cloak, tiara, or couch of gold.</p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="15">
<p><label>Hermes</label> Yes; such shall be their fate. But,
Charon, do you observe the teeming millions, some of
them seafaring men, some engaged in war, some in litigation, others tilling the soil, others lending money,
and others asking alms?</p>

<p><label>Charon</label> Yes, I see the throng—a pretty motley one—

a kind of sting of his own, with which he torments his
neighbor; while some few, like wasps, make a business

that hovers over them unseen-—who are they?</p>

<p><label>Hermes</label> Hopes, Charon, and fears, and follies, lusts,
and avaricious desires, passions and hates, and such
like. Of these, folly mingles with the throng upon the
earth, yea, verily, is even their fellow-citizen; so, also
hate and anger, and jealousy, and ignorance, and want
and greed. Butfear and hopes soar aloft. The former,
swooping down, frightens one out of his wits, sometimes
even makes him cower in terror; while hopes float overhead, and at the very moment one thinks he is going to
lay hold of them, are on the wing, leaving him all
agape—just as you see Tantalus<ref n="33"/>  served in the Jower

will also catch sight of the Fates on high, turning for
each one the spindle, from which it appears that all
hang by delicate threads. Do you see any threads coming down upon each from the spindles, exactly like sort
of cobwebs?</p>

<p><label>Charon</label> I do see each one’s thread, though very slender, wreathed indeed into a tangled network, this with
yonder man’s thread and his in turn with another’s.</p>

<p><label>Hermes</label> Quite likely, Sir Ferryman. For it is fated
that that one should be murdered by this one, and this
one by another, that this person should be that man’s
heir whose thread is smaller, and that person this one’s
heir, for that is about the meaning of the intricate network. Do you actually see that all are suspended by a
tiny thread? And this one has been hoisted up so that
he is in mid-air, and by and by when the thread snaps,
when it can no longer sustain the weight, he will tumble down with a tremendous crash; while that one
raised only a little way above the earth, even if he fall,
will have a noiseless descent, his neighbors even scarcely
hearing the sound of his fall.</p>

<p><label>Charon</label> This account is perfectly ridiculous, Hermes.</p>

<p><label>Hermes</label> Yet you couldn’t begin to tell as it deserves, how ridiculous it all is, Charon, especially their
intense eagerness, and the fact that right in the midst of
their hopes they are suddenly snatched away by their
best friend, Death. He has very many messengers and
ministers, as you perceive—chills and fevers, consumption, inflammation of the lungs, the sword, robber
bands, hemlock juice, judges and despots. Men take
no thought at all about any of these things, so long as
they are prosperous; but when they fall from their
high estate, then there’s no end of “Ohs!” “Ahs!’ and
‘““Ah mes!’ But if they were to bear in mind from the
very first that they are themselves but mortal, and after
sojourning in the world their usual time—brief at that—
will depart as it were, out of a dream, leaving everything upon the earth, they would live more wisely and
be less grieved at dying. But, as the case stands, they
expect to have the use of the present world for all time;
and so, when the minister of death, standing near, calls
and leads them away, having chained them to a fu-

neral pyre, or to consumption, they are displeased at
being carried off, having never anticipated that they
would have to part company with it. Why, what
would the man do, who, at great pains, builds himself a
house and hurries up the workmen, if he should learn
that he will see it finished, but will himself depart, as
soon as he has got the roof on, leaving his heir to get the
benefit of it, he, himself, poor fellow, not having had
even a meal within its walls? And the man who is
jubilant because his wife has borne him a gon, and entertains his friends<ref n="34"/>  on account of it, and christens the
boy with his own father’s name, if he understood that
the child would die when seven years old, pray do you
think he would rejoice at his birth? But the reason is
that he only observes the one who is fortunate in his
son, the father, I mean, of the athlete who has won a
victory at the Olympic games;<ref n="35"/> whereas he does not
observe his neighbor who carries his little one forth to
burial, nor does he note by how slender a thread his
child hung. You perceive some quarreling over the
boundary lines of their estates and others heaping up
riches, and then, before they have a chance to enjoy
them, summoned by the messengers and ministers of
whom I spoke.</p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="18">
<p><label>Charon</label> Yes, I observe all this; and I’m racking
my brain to make out what pleasure they have during life, or what that is, at the loss of which they are
distressed. At all events, if one look at the kings
among them—the very men who are apparently most
happy—aside from the fickle and, as you say, uncertain part which Dame Fortune plays, he will find that
the troubles which it is their lot to experience, the terrors and tumults, the hateful deeds and cabals, the insults and fulsome comp]iments—outnumber the pleasant
things; for all princes are no strangers to such trials. I
pass over sorrows, diseases, and accidents which, of
course, wield the scepter over them equally with other

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="19">
<p> And by the bye, I fain would tell
you, Hermes, what mankind and all the life they lead
seemed to me to be like. Have you ever seen bubbles
rise up in water, where a brook falls in a cascade? I
mean the bubbles of which the foam is composed. Well,
then, some of them are small and burst at once and
vanish, and some hold out longer, and, becoming prodigiously inflated by the addition of others, attain to
enormous dimensions. But presently these, too, burst
all to pieces, for it cannot be otherwise. Such is human
life. All are breathed into by the spirit of life, some
in a greater degree, others in a less; and some continue
to be inflated for a brief but fleeting span, while others
disappear as soon as they come into being. All, I repeat, must needs break to pieces.</p>

<p><label>Charon</label> And though such is their nature, Hermes,
you see what they are about and how they vie with one
another in the competition for offices, honors and possessions, all of which they will have to leave behind,
and come to us with just one obol. Is it your pleasure,
then, seeing we are upon an eminence, that I cry out
with might and main and exhort them to desist from
this silly drudgery and to live, keeping death ever before their eyes? And shall I say to them, O fools!
why are you so eager about these things? Cease toiling, for you will not live forever. Naught of the grand
things here is eternal, nor could one at death carry
away with himself, any of them; but he must needs depart empty-handed, and his home, estate and gold must,
from time to time, change their owners and become the
property of different people. If I should din in their
ears these and such like expostulations within hearing
distance, don’t you think the world would be much advantaged and men would become a great deal wiser?

<p>Introduction: Timon was a citizen of Athens in the palmy
days of the Attic Comedy, by which he was stamped as the type
of misanthropy, a character which he has had the singular fortune to sustain ever since. The ancient notices of him are few
and meager. Plutarch, in hislifeof Antony, who, after his downfall, compared his own fate to that of Timon, gives the following
brief account of the latter:

“Timon was an Athenian who lived about the time of the
Peloponnesian war (431-405 B.C.), as we may conclude from the
plays of Aristophanes and Plato; for he is brought forward in
them as peevish and misanthropical. Though he avoided and rejected all intercourse with men, yet he received in a friendly
manner Alcibiades, who was a young, audacious fellow, and
showed him great affection. And when Apemantus wondered
at this, and asked the reason, he said that he liked the young
man, because he knew that he would be the cause of much ill to
the Athenians, Apemantus was the only person whom he sometimes allowed to approach him, because he was like himself and
imitated his mode of life. On one occasion, during the festival
called Choés, when the two were feasting together, Apemantus
said, ‘How delightfulthe entertainment is, Timon !’—‘ Yes, if you
were not here,’ was the reply. It is said, that when the Athenians were in public assembly, Timon ascended the bema and
called for silence, which raised great expectation, on account of
the unusual nature of the circumstance: he then said, ‘I havea
small plot of building ground, men of Athens, and there is a fig
tree growing on it, on which many of the citizens have already
hung themselves. Now, as I intend to build on the ground, I
wish to give public notice, that if any of you choose, they may
hang themselves before the fig tree is cut down.’ After his death
he was buried in Hale, near the sea; but the shore in front of
the place slipped down, and the sea, surrounding the tomb, made
it inaccessible and unapproachable. The inscription on the tomb
was:
<pb n="p.244"/>

<quote>
   <l>Here from the load of life released I lie;</l> 
   <l>Ask not my name; but take my curse and die.</l>
</quote> 

And they say that he wrote this inscription during his lifetime;
but that which is commonly circulated as the inscription is by
Callimachus:

<p>We have this picture of him by the chorus of women in the
Lysistrata (808 ff.) of Aristophanes:

<l>By bitter detestation led,</l>
<l>And many a curse invoked upon their impious head.</l>
<l>So this your friend to wicked men was moved</l>
<l>By hatred, but by women dearly loved.</l>
</p>

<p>And in the Birds (1547 f.) Prometheus calls himself a “Timon
pure and simple (<foreign>καθαρός</foreign>)”.

</p>

<p>Phrynichus, of the Old Comedy, makes his hero say in the
Monotropos (Hermit) :

<cit>
    <quote>
        <l>I lead a Timon’s life—</l>
        <l>No wife, no servant, verjuiced, unapproachable;</l>

    </quote>
    <bibl>Phrynichus, Monotropos, trans. Gildersleeve.</bibl>
</cit>


</p>

<p>Callimachus has two epigrams relating to Timon:

    <cit>
        <quote><l>Utter no word of kind adieu, base heart, pass thou by;</l>
            <l>Say’st thou farewell, or draw not nigh, ‘tis all the same to me.</l></quote>
        <bibl>Tytler</bibl>
    </cit>


</p>
<p>And then, as if to complete and intensify the conception of his
misanthropy, he represents Timon as never ceasing to hate even
in the world of shadows:

<cit>
    <quote>
        <l>Say, Timon, sunk in night, abhorr’st thou now</l>
        <l>The light above or gloomy shades below?</l>
        <l>‘I hate the shades, since filled with humankind</l>
        <l>In greater numbers than I left behind.’</l>
    </quote>
    <bibl>Tytler.</bibl>
</cit>



</p>

<p>Plutarch leaves us to infer that Timon became embittered by
the base ingratitude of those whom he had befriended with his
wealth, but who turned to him the cold shoulder when he himself became poor. This idea Lucian develops more fully. Perhaps, as Prof. Charles R. Williams suggests, ‘one main cause for
<pb n="p.245"/>

his soured disposition” was ‘the growing degeneracy of the times
—the moral and religious disintegration,” which he saw going on
around him, and “the influx of laxer moral ideas.” In bitter disgust he secludes himself in his lonely tower, taking no part in the
life of men, except to criticize with cynical contempt. He is said
to have died in consequence of refusing the services of a surgeon
to set a broken limb.</p>

<p>How much, if any, Shakspere was indebted to Lucian for the
materials of his Timon of Athens has been a disputed question
among scholars. Skottowe remarks (Life of Shakspere, Vol. IL,
p. 280): “It has been deemed a satisfactory conclusion, that he
derived none of his materialsfrom Lucian, because no translation
of the dialogue of Timon is known to have existed in Shakspere’s
day. But it should rather have been inferred from the many
striking coincidences between the play and the dialogue, that
Lucian had some influence over the composition of Timon, although the channel through which the influence was communicated is no longer to be traced.” If there was no English translation of Lucian’s work, Erasmus, at least, had rendered it into
Latin, and Timon was a familiar character in literature. His
story was doubtless known to Shakspere through Paynter’s Palace of Pleasure, and through the passage from Plutarch already
quoted. There is extant an earlier play upon the same theme,
written about 1600, and edited in 1842 by Dyce for the Shaksperean
Society. This, however, was intended for an academic audience
only, and there is no evidence that Shakspere was acquainted
with it. His own play he left unfinished. He wrote out the main
part of it, and outlined its general plan, but a later hand worked
it up into the form in which we now have it. This author may
have been familiar with Lucian’s dialogue.</p>

<p>Gervinus, in his Commentaries, affirms that Shakspere was “indirectly acquainted with Lucian’s Timon. The digging up of the
gold, the parasites’ pursuit of him, his driving them away with
stones and blows, the portioning of his servant, and even some
resemblances in the imagery and speeches leave scarcely any
doubt of this, But the use of Roman names seems to prove that
he did not borrow directly from Lucian, as Shakspere would in
that case have avoided them.” Shakspere’s Timon refuses the
gold; Lucian’s refuses, but afterward reluctantly accepts it, in
deference tothe divinecommand. Thereis also some correspondence between the poet and Gnathonides, the flatterer, who offers
Timon the tribute of an ode, and between the senators and Demeas,
the public man. Other similarities and contrasts in treatment
are suggested in the notes.</p>

<p>There is a marked difference in aim between the two authors.
Shakspere seeks to arouse sympathy and compassion for Timon.
In the earlier scenes of the play he represents him as in the heyday of wealth and popularity, and courted by crowds of flatterers
and “trencher friends,” who impose upon his lavish generosity
and eat him out of house and home, and then abandon him to his
poverty and wretchedness with the most unfeeling indifference.
It is against these parasites and sycophants that the dramatist
<pb n="p.246"/>

directs his satire, while their unhappy victim is the “noble” Timon.
Lucian’s satire takes a wider range. One of its motives is to discredit the popular theology, by picturing Zeus as utterly unconcerned about the wrong-doing that is going on in the world, and
in particular the treatment to which the hero of the dialogue had
been subjected. Another is to show up the poet, parasite, the
politician, professional philosopher and the cheat, who, on hearing of hisnewly-found wealth, hasten to fawn upon him as of yore.
A third motive of the satire is to exhibit Timon and that class of
which he is a type in their true character, as wronged, to be sure,
by those who prey upon them, but as themselves really to blame
for it all, because of their folly, simple-mindedness and lack of
discrimination in choosing their friends and companions. That
Lucian did not place a high estimate upon the character of Timon
would appear from what he says of him in the True Story. He
there represents him as standing sentry at the single narrow pass
between the rivers that flow around the abode of the damned.
While giving his own interpretation to Timon’s character, Lucian
was no doubt influenced by a play, not now extant, of that name,
by Antiphanes, one the most distinguished poets of the Middle
Comedy. He also derived some suggestions from the Plutus of
his favorite master, Aristophanes. Lucian gives an original and
striking turn to the plot in representing his hero as having suddenly had his wealth restored to him.</p></note></head>

and in every way plot against me. And lastly, you
said that I have betrayed you; whereas, on the contrary, I myself would charge you with driving me out
in every way and with thrusting me forth head-foremost from your dwelling. Therefore, instead of a soft

man in one day paid the city in full of all demands sixteen talents out of my purse—for he had had judgment
given against him, and in default of payment, had been
bound with fetters, and I took pity on him and set him
free.<ref n="65"/>  But when recently it fell to his lot to apportion
the theoric fund<ref n="66"/>  to the tribe of Erechtheis, and I went
and asked him for my proper share, he declared he
didn’t recognize me as a citizen. (Enter Demeas.)</p>

coming with parted beard and eyebrows elevated, and
cocking his nose a bit all to himself, looking the very
image of a Titan, the hair over his forehead standing on
end, as if he were frightened out of his wits—a veritable Boreas,<ref n="76"/> or Triton, as Zeuxis<ref n="77"/>  painted them. This
fellow—trim in dress, regular in gait, seemly in the
way he wears his mantle—early in the morning indulges in an utterly exhaustless flow of talk about “virtue,” berates the devotees of pleasure and extols contentment with little. But when, after a bath, he goes
to his dinner and the waiter hands him a wine cup of
massive size—for he delights especially in drinking
wine less-tempered<ref n="78"/>  than people usually take it—just as
though he had quaffed a goblet of the water of Lethe,<ref n="79"/>
he conducts himself in a fashion directly opposite to his
morning discourse. He snatches at the dainties before
him just like a kite, and elbows his neighbor aside.
He gets his beard saturated with rich sauce, and gorges
himself likea dog. He habitually stoops over, just as
if he expected to find in the dishes “the virtue’ upon
which he expatiates so eloquently. He carefully wipes
the bowls clean with his forefinger, so as not to leave
behind even a morsel of the hodgepodge of cheese,
honey and garlic.</p>

and carry him out of the drinking room, after he has
thrown both arms around the flute girl.<ref n="80"/>  Albeit, even
when sober, he would yield the palm to none for lying,
effrontery, or covetousness. On the contrary, he is the

only fair that he should receive for himself a double, or

<head>The Parasite; or, Parasitism Considered as an Art.<note><p>Introduction: The following dialogue is a good-humored satire
    upon a character which had a certain recognized standing in the
    later social life of Athens and at Rome under the emperors, and
    to which modern society is not altogether a stranger. In the
    luxurious society of those days, it was a very general custom for
    families of wealth and position to practice a lavish hospitality,
    which included within the range of its favors not only the private
    friends of the house, but also a class of persons with no visible
    means of support, but who made a business of dining out, getting
    an invitation in return for contributing by their buffoonery to the
    entertainment of the guests, or by playing the part of Sir Pertinax
    MacSycophant to the self-esteem of the host. These people, goodnatured and easy-going, skilied in all the ways of society, and
    often, withal, of considerable culture, were appropriately called
    parasites, from the faculty they had of fastening themselves upon
    the rich, and getting themselves dined and wined at their expense. Athenzus, a Greek gentleman of the third century A.D.,
    who wrote one of the earliest collections of what are called “Ana,”
    speaks of three sorts of parasites. There was the parasite who
    was in demand to entertain the table with his bright remarks,
    stories and bons mots, for which, no doubt he made special preparation. Then there was the parasite whose stock in trade was
    his knowledge of human nature and his ability to play upon the
    self-conceit of his host by toadying and flattery. A still lower
    class curried favor with the rich by their obsequious servility,
    running of errands and rendering almost any service, no matter
    how menial, The writers of Comedy were not slow to level their
    shafts at such choice game, notably in the Phormio of Terence.
    The present dialogue is in the catechetical style of Plato, upon
    which, perhaps, it is intended to be a sort of burlesque.</p></note>

<head>INTERLOCUTORS.
<label>Simon</label>, a Parasite, and his friend, <label>Tychiades</label>.</head>


<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="1">
    <p><label>Tychiades</label> Pray, how comes it, Simon, that
everybody else, free and slave alike, is versed in some
<pb n="p.280"/>

craft, by means of which he makes himself useful both
to himself and to others; whereas you, to all appearance, have no occupation, whereby you can get any
good yourself or contribute to another’s well being?</p>

<p><label>Parasite</label> I donot yet understand, Tychiades, what
you mean by yourinquiry. Pray, try and put your question more clearly.</p>

<p><label>Tychiades</label> Well, my point is this—is there any art of
which you are master—for example, music?</p>

<p><label>Parasite</label> Why, yes, my dear fellow! But, ’pon my
word, it isn’t that one.</p>

<p><label>Tychiades</label> What then? Is it the healing art?</p>

<p><label>Parasite</label> No, not even that.</p>

<p><label>Tychiades</label> Well, it’s geometry, is it?</p>

<p><label>Parasite</label> Oh, no, no!</p>

<p><label>Tychiades</label> What then? Is it rhetoric? For you are as
far removed from philosophy as even wickedness is.</p>

<p><label>Parasite</label> Yes, if such a thing is possible, even farther
off. So don’t pretend to cast that fact in my teeth, just
as though I wasn’t aware of it. For I confess I’m bad—
yes, even worse than you think.</p>

<p><label>Tychiades</label> Undoubtedly! But perhaps youdidn’t master these arts, because of their magnitude and difficulty,
but some one of the common trades, such, for example,
as carpentry, or shoemaking? For in other respects
you are not so situated as to have no need even of such
a trade.</p>

<p><label>Parasite</label> You are right about that, Tychiades. But as
a matter of fact, I’m not versed in any of these.</p>

<p><label>Tychiades</label> Well, in what other, then?</p>

<p><label>Parasite</label> What trade? A noble one, in my opinion;
and if you should learn it, I’m thinking you, too,
would commend it. I’ve already made, I think, a success of it practically; but whether I shall succeed in
vindicating it in your estimation, I can’t say.</p>

<p><label>Tychiades</label> Well, what sort of a thing is it?</p>

<p><label>Parasite</label> As for the arguments relating to it, I feel that
I haven’t mastered them yet. The fact, however, that
I’m versed in some art, it is possible for you to know
already, and you shouldn’t be out of humor with me on
that score. But what it is, you shall hear by and by.</p>

<p><label>Tychiades</label> But I can’t wait.
<pb n="p.281"/>

</p>

<p><label>Parasite</label> Perhaps, though, when you’ve heard what it
is, my art will strike you as of a very paradoxical
nature.</p>

<p><label>Tychiades</label> And yet, for that very reason, I’m on the quiz
vive to know what it is.</p>

<p><label>Parasite</label> Well, I'll tell you one of these days, Tychiades.</p>

<p><label>Tychiades</label> Nay, notso! But tell me at once, unless,
forsooth, you are ashamed to.</p>

<p><label>Parasite</label> Well, it’s—it’s—the trade of a parasite.</p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="2">
<p><label>Tychiades</label> Why, Simon! Would anybody call that
a trade, if he weren’t beside himself?</p>

<p><label>Parasite</label> Well, I for my part call itso. But if I seem
to you to be beside myself, please regard my mental
aberration as the cause of my not knowing any other
art, and at once acquit me of your imputations. For
they say this goddess,<ref n="1"/> though harsh in other respects
to those who are possessed of her, exonerates them from
their faults, taking the blame upon herself, as their
teacher, or tutor.</p>

<p><label>Tychiades</label> Well, then, Simon, is parasitism an art?</p>

<p><label>Parasite</label> Yes, an art, and I’m her handicraftsman.</p>

<p><label>Tychiades</label> And you, then, are a parasite?</p>

<p><label>Parasite</label> You cast it in my teeth as altogether a reproach, Tychiades.</p>

<p><label>Tychiades</label> But don’t you blush to call yourself a parasite?</p>

<p><label>Parasite</label> Not at all! I should be ashamed of myself not
to acknowledge it.</p>

<p><label>Tychiades</label> Good heavens! Whenever we wish to present you to somebody who does not know you, must
we, as a matter of course, introduce you as “the parasite,’? when he craves your acquaintance?</p>

<p><label>Parasite</label> Yes, and in doing so, you will gratify me
much more than you would Phidias by calling hima
sculptor. For I delight in my art no less than Phidias
did in his statue of Zeus.</p>

<p><label>Tychiades</label> And besides, as I think the matter over, I
find occasion for no end of laughter.</p>

<p><label>Parasite</label> What is it all about?</p>

<p><label>Tychiades</label> Why, if, according to custom, we should

<note n="1"/> This goddess: <foreign>Μανία</foreign>, madness, personified.
<pb n="p.282"/>

place your name at the head of the letters we address
you, it would read “To Simon, the Parasite.”</p>

<p><label>Parasite</label> And indeed, by doing so you would please
me, more thany ou would Dion<ref n="2"/>  by giving him the title,
philosopher, in the superscription.</p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="3">
<p><label>Tychiades</label> Well, I care little or nothing how you
like to be called. But pray consider also the further
absurdity of the thing.</p>

<p><label>Parasite</label> And pray, what is that?</p>

<p><label>Tychiades</label> Why, if we reckon this also among the arts,
then when any one inquires what is the nature of art,
so-called, we shall have to mention by way of illustration the grammatic art, the art of medicine, that of the
parasite, etc.</p>

<p><label>Parasite</label> Well, Tychiades, I should say that this is
much more of an art than any of the others. And if
you have a mind to listen, I’ll give you my views upon
the subject, although, as I said before, I’m utterly unprepared to do so.</p>

<p><label>Tychiades</label> Oh, that will make no difference, provided
you are brief and say what’s true.</p>

<p><label>Parasite</label> Well, then, if you like, let us in the first place
consider what is the essential nature of an art. For in
this way we shall also be able to distinguish the arts
according to their kind, and determine whether they
really partake of the nature of an art.</p>

<p><label>Tychiades</label> Tell us, then, what an artis, No doubt you
know all about it.</p>

<p><label>Parasite</label> Certainly!</p>

<p><label>Tychiades</label> Don’t hesitate, then, to tell what it is, if
you really know.</p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="4">
<p><label>Parasite</label> Well, then “anart,” as I remember to have
heard a certain wise man say, “an art<ref n="3"/>  is a system of
perceptions, or ideas, harmoniously directed to some
useful end in the economy of human life.”</p>

<p><label>Tychiades</label> Yes, you have correctly stated what the

<p><label>Parasite</label> Now, if parasitism partakes of all these ideas,
would it not also be itself an art?

</p>

<p><label>Tychiades</label> Why, yes, if the facts are as you represent.</p>

<p><label>Parasite</label> Come, then! Let us test parasitism, by applying to it one by one the general principles which
characterize an art, and see whether it is in accord
therewith; lest otherwise, just as poor pottery does
when struck, it give outa false note. Well, then, to
proceed—this, too, just like every art, must be a system
of ideas. In the first place, one has to apply tests and
exercise judgment in determining who would be a
suitable person to give him a support, and with whom
he can begin to play the parasite, without having occasion to repent of it by and by. Or shall we affirm that
the assayer of silver possesses an art, if indeed he
knows how to distinguish spurious coins from the genuine, but that the parasite, without the aid of art, discriminates the base among men from the good, especially since men do not, like coins, show right off for
what they are? Why, also the wise Euripides complains of this very thing in these words:

<cit>
    <quote>
        <l>Upon their frame no stamp hath nature set,<ref n="4"/></l>
        <l>Whereby the base ’mong men can be discerned.</l>
    </quote>
    <bibl>Medea, 518-519.</bibl>
</cit>
</p>

<p>


Plainly the art of the parasite is all the greater, since
indeed it both recognizes and knows, better than that
of the seer, things that are so obscure and out of sight.</p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="5">
<p>Then, too, there’s the knowledge one must have of
just the right words to say, and the right things to do,
by which he will secure the favor of his patron, and
show himself most kindly disposed toward him.—Don’t
you think that this requires mother-wit and a keen perception?</p>

<p><label>Tychiades</label> Certainly!</p>

<p><label>Parasite</label> Yes, and on festive occasions themselves, that
one may go forth from the banquet hall having the
best of everybody, and more highly esteemed than those
who do not possess the same art with himself—can this
be accomplished, think you, without acting upon some
definite principle, or without a sound judgment?

</p>

<p><label>Tychiades</label> By no means.</p>

<p><label>Parasite</label> And how about this? Does the ability to
recognize the good and the bad qualities of victuals and
sauces seem to you a piece of meddlesomeness characteristic of a person ignorant of the principles of
art?—especially when our most noble Plato speaks
on this wise: “If the guest at a banquet<ref n="5"/>  is not a
connoisseur in cookery, his judgment upon the
dinner as it is brought on carries less weight.”
</p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="6">
<p>Indeed, that parasitism grows out of not only perception, but also the practical exercise of the same, you
can easily learn from the following considerations.
The perceptions that belong to the other arts remain
unexercised for days, and nights, months and years ofttimes, and yet these arts do not perish in the case of
those who have once acquired them. Whereas, unless
the perceptions of the parasite are daily put in practice,
in my opinion not only is the art utterly lost, but even
the artist himself is done for. </p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="7">
<p>However, as to
whether parasitism has in view some useful end in life,
I fear it may be a symptom even of mental unsoundness to ask such a question. For I find that nothing is
more useful in the world than eating and drinking.
Indeed it’s impossible even to live without this.</p>

<p><label>Tychiades</label> Of course!</p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="8">
<p><label>Parasite</label> And further, parasitism is not any such
thing even as beauty or strength, so as to be, on the
face of it, not itself an art, but merely some endowment
like them.</p>

<p><label>Tychiades</label> Quite true!</p>

<p><label>Parasite</label> No, nor yet is it a condition in which skill is
lacking. For unskillfulness would never enable a, person who is possessed of it to make a success of anything. Why, suppose somebody should have a ship
intrusted to his care in a storm at sea, when he doesn’t
know how to steer—would he weather the storm?</p>

<p><label>Tychiades</label> Of course not.</p>

<p><label>Parasite</label> And what possible reason can be given for
this except that he doesn’t possess skill whereby he can
save himself.</p>

<p><label>Tychiades</label> Certainly! that accounts for it.

<note n="5"/> If a person about to attend a banquet, etc.: See Plato's Theetetus, 178.

<pb n="p.285"/>

</p>

<p><label>Parasite</label> Would not, then, a parasite also fail to keep
himself alive by means of parasitism, if indeed it were
a condition in which skill is wanting?</p>

<p><label>Tychiades</label> Yes!</p>

<p><label>Parasite</label> Well, then, it’s skill, is it not, that keeps
him alive—not the absence of it?</p>

<p><label>Tychiades</label> To be sure!</p>

<p><label>Parasite</label> It follows, then, that parasitism is an art.</p>

<p><label>Tychiades</label> Yes, an art, so it seems.</p>

<p><label>Parasite</label> And further, I’ve often known capable helmsmen and expert charioteers to fall off their seats, some
getting their bones broken and others being killed outright; whereas nobody can mention any such wreck in
the case of a parasite. Well, then, if parasitism is not
a condition in which skill is wanting, nor a mere endowment, but a system of trained perceptions, evidently we’ve to-day come to an understanding that it
is an art.</p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="9">
<p><label>Tychiades</label> Yes, I infer as much from your premises.
But let us also have a good definition of parasitism!</p>

<p><label>Parasite</label> Yes, you are right in your demand. Indeed,
to my thinking, it has been best defined as follows:
Parasitism is an art that has to do with what we eat
and drink, including also what is to be said in behalf
of these things; and its end is pleasure.</p>

<p><label>Tychiades</label> I think you’ve defined your own art exceedingly well. But look out, or you’ll have on your hands
a quarrel with some of the philosophers, as respects the
end it has in view.</p>

<p><label>Parasite</label> Well, it’s, at any rate, enough, if, as the
fact is, parasitism and happiness have the same end in
view.</p>

Lemnos, in the Aegean Sea. Here he remained until the last year of the war,

 </p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="11">
<p>Yet Epicurus has had the amazing effrontery to
appropriate the object which parasitism has in view,
and make it the aim of what he calls happiness. That
this is a piece of plagiarism on his part and that Epicurus does not really concern himself about pleasure,
whereas the parasite does, you can learn from the following considerations. For myself I regard pleasure
as, in the first place, a condition of calm repose of the
fleshly nature; and, secondly, as that state in which the
soul is free from turmoil and disquiet. Now the parasite attains both of these states, Epicurus<ref n="13"/>  neither. For
he is always racking his brain over the form of the
earth, and the infinite extent of the universe, the size
of the sun, the distances of celestial bodies, and the
original elements of matter, and over the question
whether the gods exist or no; and he is all the time
wrangling and quarreling with somebody about the
highest good itself, and so finds himself involved not
only in human anxieties, but also in those which concern the universe at large. Whereas the parasite
thinks that all is well, and believes implicitly that a
change would be no improvement upon the existing
order of things; and so with great freedom from fear
and with calmness of mind—allowing none of the
things I have mentioned to interfere with his comfort—
he eats and sleeps, lying upon his back with his hands
and feet outstretched, just as was the case with Odysseus, when he sailed homeward from Scheria.<ref n="14"/>   </p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="12">

<note n="13"/> Epicurus: See Zeus in Heroics, note 13. His philosophy concerned itself very
pe A problems of matter and the universe. He wrote much upon these

<p>On arriving at their destination the crew laid him, yet heavy with slumber, cn
the sand, and departed, Od. 18, 73 ff.

<pb n="p.288"/>

But it is not only in these respects that pleasure has
nothing to do with Epicurus, but also in the following
particulars, to wit:—This Epicurus, whoever he is—
the sage, they call him—surely can eat, or he cannot;
now, if he cannot, not only will he fail to enjoy life,
but he will not make out to live atall. But if he can
eat, he must get his living either out of his own resources, or off somebody else. If, then, he gets his
living off somebody else, he is a parasite, and not what
he says he is; but if from his own resources, then he
will not get any enjoyment out of life.</p>

<p><label>Tychiades</label> Why not?</p>

<p><label>Parasite</label> Why, if he gets his victuals by his own
means, many inconveniences, let me tell you, my dear
Tychiades, must inevitably attend such a life. Just
consider how many they are! Whoever will pass life
pleasantly must satisfy all his innate appetites. What
do you say to that?</p>

<p><label>Tychiades</label> Yes, that’s my opinion.</p>

<p><label>Parasite</label> Well, such a thing is easy, perhaps, for a
person who has an abundance, but for one who has
little or nothing, it is no longer possible. A poor man,
therefore, cannot become a sage, or attain the highest
good—I mean pleasure, you know. Nay, not even the
rich man, for that matter, who spends his substance in
the unstinted gratification of his desires, can attain
this. Why, pray? Because, whoever spends his own
means must inevitably meet with many disagreeable experiences. Now he gets into an altercation with his
cook for making a botch of the cooking, or if he doesn’t
have a set-to with him, he has to eat the viands—poor
stuff at that—and fails to obtain any enjoyment. And
now he is involved in a quarrel with the man who has
charge of his household affairs, in case the latter does
not manage well. Isn’t that so?</p>

<p><label>Tychiades</label> Certainly! I agree with you.</p>

<p><label>Parasite</label> Now, in the case of Epicurus, all these things
are likely to happen, and therefore he will never attain
the highest good. Whereas the parasite has no cook
with whom to get angry, no estate, or house-steward, or
money, the loss of which would occasion him grief, and
has all he wants to eat and drink, while he alone hag

none of the annoyances which must needs trouble those
people.</p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="13">
<p rend="merge">Well, that parasitism is an art has been
made sufficiently clear from these and the other considerations. It remains to be shown, that it is algo the
best art, and that not in the abstract merely; but, in
the first place, that, it surpasses all the arts taken together, and then that it surpasses each one also in particular. Looking, then, at the arts as a whole, it is
superior to them in the following respects. Every
other art of necessity involves study and toil, anxiety
and blows, the very things that everybody without exception would deprecate. Whereas, this is the only
art, it would seem, which one can learn without labor.
For, who ever went away from a dinner in tears, just as
we see some do from the schools? And who, when on
his way to a dinner, ever appeared in low spirits, as
they do who resort to the schools? Yes, the parasite
goes to a dinner of his own accord, nothing loth, out of
sheer passion for his art; whereas they who acquire the
other arts, hate them, so that some run away on accourt of them. And how about this? Ought you not
also to consider the fact that fathers and mothers, when
their children make progress in those arts, reward them
chiefly with the very gifts with which they every day
honor the parasite too? “Why, how beautifully the
boy has written!’ say his parents, “give him something to eat,” or ‘What a wretched piece of writing;
don’t give him anything!’ So important does the
matter seem, both for reward and for punishment. 14.
Furthermore, all other arts have this reward later, and
it is only after one has learned them that the enjoyment of their fruits comes. For long and “steep is the
path that leads to them.’? Whereas the trade of a
parasite is the only one among them all that has the
benefit of the art at once in the very process of learning
it, both at the moment it is begun and when it is completed. Moreover, all of the other arts, without exception, have in view as their sole object the gaining of a
livelihood; while the parasite has his subsistence assured from the very moment he enters upon his trade.
Do you not observe that the farmer tills the soil, not
for the sake of tilling it, and the carpenter does carpena.

tering, not for the sake of doing it, whereas the parasite
has no other object in view, but both his occupation
and the purpose which leads him to follow it, are identical?</p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="15">
<p rend="merge">And again, as to the following facts at
least, there is no one who isn’t cognizant of them.
They who practice the other arts work hard at them all
the time, with the exception of only one or two holy
days, which they observe each month, and the holidays
—some yearly, others monthly—which the cities celebrate, and they are said to have a merry time then.
Whereas, the parasite keeps thirty holy days every
month, for in his opinion they are all sacred to the
gods.</p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="16">
<p rend="merge">Besides, they who wish to succeed in the
other arts are moderate eaters and drinkers, just like
sick folks; for one cannot learn them and at the same
time give himself up to the pleasures of the table and
of the glass.</p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="17">
<p rend="merge">And the other arts, without tools,
can be of no service whatever to him who has acquired
them. For it isn’t possible to play the flute without
you have a flute, or the lyre without a lyre, or to ride
horseback unless you have a horse; whereas the art in
question is so excellent and easy for the craftsman that
it is possible for him to practice it, even without any
tool.</p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="18">
<p rend="merge">And while learning other arts we pay a fee,
it would appear, but take pay while learning this. 19.
Moreover, all other arts have their teachers, whereas
that of the parasite has none, but just as Socrates said
of the poet’s art, this, too, comes by a sort of divine
allotment.<ref n="15"/></p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="20">
<p rend="merge">And note this fact also, that we are

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="21">
<p><label>Tychiades</label> Yes, all that is true, no doubt.</p>

<p><label>Parasite</label> And besides, my dear Tychiades, the other arts
seem to me to have a hankering after this one, whereas
this art has no desire for any other.</p>

<p><label>Tychiades</label> But how about this? Don’t you think that
they do wrong who take things that belong to sumebody else?</p>

<p><label>Parasite</label> Why, of course!

<p><label>Tychiades</label> How comes it, then, that the parasite is the
only one who does no wrong in taking what belongs to
somebody else?</p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="22">
<p><label>Parasite</label> Well, as to that, I can’t say. But to
proceed —the other arts are sort of mean and paltry in
their origin, whereas the parasite’s art has an exceedingly noble one. For you will find that it has its
source in nothing else than friendship, a word that is
in everybody’s mouth.</p>

<p><label>Tychiades</label> What do you mean?</p>

<p><label>Parasite</label> Why, that nobody invites to a dinner an
enemy, ora stranger—nay, not even one whom he knows
only passably well; but the invited guest, I hold, must
be previously a friend, in order that he may take part
in the drink offerings and the privileges of the table,
and in the mysteries of this art. I at least have often
heard people remark, “What sort of a friend can that
person be, who has never eaten and drunk with us?”—
evidently regarding him alone as a faithful friend who
has partaken of food and drink with them.</p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="23">
<p rend="merge">That
this is verily the most royal of all arts, you can learn
from the following by no means least important consideration. In the case of all other arts, they who work at
them not only are in sorry plight and reeking with sweat,
but, by my troth, they have to sit down, or stand up to
them, just as though they were in fact slaves of their
trades; whereas the parasite practices his own art like
a king, in a recumbent posture, 24. But why need I
describe in detail his good fortune? how he is the only
one in fact, who, according to the wise Homer:

<p><label>Parasite</label> Well, I think I’ve demonstrated that it
is superior to all arts taken together. But come! Let
us now consider how it also surpasses each one individually. It is absurd to compare it with the purely
mechanical arts. By doing so one somehow detracts
rather from the dignity of the art. Bethat as it may,
I have only to prove that it is superior to the most
beautiful and greatest arts. It is, you know, conceded
by all that both rhetoric and philosophy which, on
account of their nobiliiy, some declare to be sciences
even, rank first among these arts. Now if I prove that
the trade of a parasite far surpasses even such arts, it
will be clear beyond doubt, that it is ever so much superior to the others, just as Nausicaa<ref n="17"/>  was to her waiting maids.</p>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="27">
<p rend="merge">Well then it transcends both of them
jointly—both rhetoric and philosophy—in the first place
as respects its very essence. For it is consistent with
itself, whereas they are not. For we do not regard
rhetoric ag always one and the same, but some look
upon it as an art, others on the contrary, as no art at
all, others still as base art, and otners as something
else. In like manner, philosophy also we do not consider as self-consistent. For Epicurus<ref n="18"/>  takes one view
of her problems, another the Stoics, the Academics
quite another, and yet another the Peripatetics. In a
word, one claims that philosophy is one thing, another
another. Even unto this very day the same men have
not reached any agreement among themselves, nor is
there any semblance of unity in their art. The conclusion which remains to be drawn from these facts is
plain. To begin with, I maintain that that which has
no consistency is not an art. For how on earth can it

be? Arithmetic is everywhere one and the same; both
with us and the Persians twice two are four, and there
is agreement upon these points alike among Greeks and
barbarians. Whereas, we see many differing systems
of philosophy and that there is no harmony between
them, either in the first principles or in the aims of any
of them.</p>

<p><label>Tychiades</label> Yes, you are right. For they say that philosophy is one, and yet, they themselves make many
philosophies of it.</p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="28">
<p><label>Parasite</label> Moreover, also, in the case of the other
arts, although there might be some lack of harmony in
them, yet one would pass it by, deeming it worthy of
pardon, because they seem undetermined, and the conceptions of them are not unchangeable. But who
could possibly abide a want of unity in philosophy, and
that she should be even more out of harmony with herself than is the case among musical instruments?
Philosophy, then, as we actually find it, is not one;
for I see that in fact it assumes countless forms. But
in the nature of things there cannot be many philosophies, for the very reason that philosophy is one, 29.
In like manner also one might say the same concerning
the nature of the art of rhetoric. For the fact that all
do not express the same views as to the one end proposed by the art, but there is a struggle of conflicting
opinions, is the strongest proof that the thing does not
exist at all, the conception of which is so wanting in
unity. Yes, and the fact that men inquire what its
nature is rather and never admit its oneness destroys the
very existence of the matter in question. 30, Such is
not the case, however, with the art of the parasite; but
both among Greeks and barbarians it is one and the
same and unchanging, and nobody can affirm that
some practice the art in one way and others in another;
nor are there, I believe, any parasites, who, like Stoics
or Epicureans, differ in their opinions, but there prevails among them all a mutual agreement and a harmony as respects what they do and the end they have
in view. To my thinking, then, parasitism, in this regard at least, is presumptively the very embodiment of
wisdom.

<p><label>Tychiades</label> Well, I think you’ve said quite enough
on that point. But how do you show that philosophy
is inferior to your art in the remaining particulars also?</p>

<p><label>Parasite</label> Well, then, it must be said, in the first place,
that there never was a parasite who fell in love with
philosophy; whereas, we are told of ever so many
philosophers who had a hankering after the parasite’s
trade; and they have a passionate love for it even to
this day.</p>

<p><label>Tychiades</label> And pray, what philosophers can you mention who essayed to play the parasite?</p>

<p><label>Parasite</label> Do you really ask who, my dear Tychiades?
Why, you know just as well as I do; you are only pretending ignorance to me, as though some disgrace, and
not honor, accrued to them therefrom.</p>

<p><label>Tychiades</label> Nay, ’pon my oath, I’m not. On the contrary, Simon, I’m in great doubt as to whom you may
actually find to mention.</p>

<p><label>Parasite</label> My good sir! You seem to me to be ignorant
even of those who wrote their lives; else you would
surely be able to recognize what ones I mean.</p>

<p><label>Tychiades</label> Really, pon my word, I’m very desirous of
hearing who they are.</p>

<p><label>Parasite</label> Well, I'll point them out to you in detail—
not the commonest sort, mind you, but those who rank
first, to my notion, and whom you least imagine. 32.
There’s Aeschines,<ref n="19"/> of course, of the Socratic school of
philosophy, the man who wrote those long and clever
dialogues—he once visited Sicily, with these in his
pocket, to see if somehow through them he might be
able to make the acquaintance of Dionysius, the tyrant.
He read before that gentleman his “Miltiades,” and
thinking that he had won the tyrant’s esteem he settled thenceforth in Sicily, where he bade farewell to the
discourses of Socrates and became parasite to Dionysius.</p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="33">
<p>And what of this? Don’t you regard Aristippus,<ref n="20"/>
of Cyrene, as one of the distinguished philosophers?

<note n="19"/> Aeschines: Not the rival of Demosthenes, but the son of a sausage seller and
a disciple of Socrates. He was so very poor that Socrates advised him ‘ to borrow mouey of himself, by diminishing his daily wants.” After the death of his
master, in the hope of bettering his condition, he retired to the court of Syracuse,
where he remained until the expulsion of Dionysius, the younger. For Dionysius, see Dream, or Cock, note 52.
<note n="20"/> Aristippus: See Dial. of Dead, 20, note 25.

<pb n="p.295"/>
</p>
<p><label>Tychiades</label> Why, certainly!</p>

<p><label>Parasite</label> This one, too, let me tell you, lived at the
same time in Syracuse and played the parasite to
Dionysius. Anyhow, of all the parasites at his court
Aristippus was beyond question the most highly esteemed. And with reason, for he was a man of considerably more natural aptitude for his art than the
rest, so that Dionysius used to send his cooks to him
every day to learn something from him. Surely this
man also seems to have worthily adorned his art. 34.
And there’s your most excellent Plato<ref n="21"/> —he himself also
visited Sicily for this purpose, and after playing the
parasite to the tyrant for afew days, was obliged to
abandon the calling because he hadn’t a natural gift
for it. He accordingly returned to Athens, and after
laborious preparation again set sail on a second voyage for Sicily; but after dining again with the tyrant
for a few days, he had to give it up from sheer stuvidity. And this mischance of Plato’s in the neighborhood of Sicily bears some resemblance to that which
befell Nicias<ref n="22"/>  there.</p>

<p><label>Tychiades</label> (Incredulous.) Who, pray, is your authority for this story, Simon?</p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="35">
<p><label>Parasite</label> (ignoring the question.) Yes, and
there are many others beside. There’s the musician,
Aristoxenus,<ref n="23"/> a man worthy of high esteem—he himself was a parasite to Neleus. Yes, and you surely
are aware that Euripides played the parasite with
Archelaus<ref n="24"/>  until his death, and Anaxarchus<ref n="25"/> with

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="37">
<p>Well, then, I have shown that philosophers, just
as I said, have applied themselves zealously to the parasite’s art; whereas nobody can point out a single parasite who wanted to be a philosopher. 38, And furthermore, if it’s a fortunate thing not to be hungry, or
thirsty, or cold, such is the case with no one else besides
the parasite. Philosophers, therefore, one may find
famished and shivering with cold, but a parasite never;
otherwise he wouldn’t be a parasite, but a sort of unlucky fellow, or beggar, or like a philosopher.</p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="89">
<p><label>Tychiades</label> Well, enough on that point, at least.
But how do you prove that the trade of a parasite is in
many respects superior to philosophy and rhetoric?</p>

<p><label>Parasite</label> Human life, my dear sir, is divided into two
periods—that of peace, I believe, and that of war.
Now, at such times, it must needs be, that the true
nature of the arts should become manifest, and also of
those who practice them. First, then, if you please,
let us consider war time, and what sort of people would
then be of the greatest possible use, each to himself individually and to the community at large.</p>

<p><label>Tychiades</label> Well, that’s no ordinary struggle you announce as coming off between the men. Yes, I, for my
part, have been laughing in my sleeve this long while
at the thought of what a figure a philosopher would cut,
coming to blows with a parasite.</p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="40">
<p><label>Parasite</label> Well, then, that you may not be utterly
lost in wonder, nor regard the affair as worthy only of
a jest, come now, let us imagine to ourselves that news
has been received, that, all of a sudden, a hostile force
has invaded the land. It is necessary to go out against
them, and one may not stand by unconcerned and see

<note n="26"/> Aristotle: Named the Stagirite, from Stagira, a Greek colony on the coast
of Macedonia, where he was born, 381 B.C. He was a pupil of Plato’s, who
called him the “ mind” of his school. The “beginning of parasitism” perhaps
refers to the three years (847-344 B. C.) which he passed with his former fellowstudent, Hermeias, ruler of Atarneus in Mysia, his relations with whom gave
rise to certain injurious, but groundless, suspicions; or, possibly, to his seven

ears’ stay (842-335) in Macedonia, as friend of Philip and tutor and adviser to

is son, Alexander. In 335 he settled in Athens, and until his death, in 322, gave
himself to the preparation of his great works and to teaching in the Lycaeum as
head of the Peripatetics. Simon’s claim that all, or any of the philosophers here
Bepnoued were parasites, in any true sense of the term, is of course a shecr
assumption.

the country laid waste; and the general commands all
of serviceable age to be enrolled, and also that the rest,
including in particular any philosophers, rhetoricians
and parasites, present themselves for duty. Now, in
the first place, let us strip them, for those who are going
to put on armor must first disrobe. Just look at the
men one by one, my good sir, and scrutinize their bodies.
Well, some of them you will see emaciated from want,
and pale, all in a tremor and exhausted as though
already wounded. Now would it not be ridiculous to
assert that men like these, in need as they are of some
refreshment, can endure the strain of battle, a hand-tohand combat, the jostling, dust and wounds?</p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="41">
<p rend="merge">But
pass in turn to the parasite, and note carefully what
sort of a person he appears to be. Is he not, in the first
place, stout in body and of agreeable complexion?—neither black nor white, for the latter is like unto a
woman’s, the former, a slave’s. And in the second
place, is he not a gallant, fierce-looking fellow, just
such as I am, big and hot-blooded? For it isn’t well to
bear into war a timorous, effeminate look. Would not,
then, such a one, while alive, be a noble-looking manat-arms, and noble, too, should he die nobly?</p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="42">
<p rend="merge">But
why need we conjecture these things, when we have
examples of them? For to speak frankly, of the rhetoricians or philosophers who have lived hitherto, some
have not even plucked up any courage at all to venture
outside the wallin war; and even if one of them was
compelled to take his place in the line of battle, I
affirm that he abandoned his post and took to his heels.</p>

<p><label>Tychiades</label> How wonderful it all is! There’s nothing
modest about your claims. All the same, say on.</p>

<p><label>Parasite</label> Moreover, among rhetoricians, Isocrates<ref n="27"/>  not
only never went to war, but not even so much as entered a court of justice—from timidity, I presume, because he hadn’t a voice of sufficient strength. And
what shallI say more? Didn’t Demades<ref n="28"/>  and Aeschines

<note n="27"/> Isocrates: The Attic orator and rhetorician (436-388 B. C.), who established
a famous school of rhetoric at Athens, and also wrote discourses to be read, not
spoken, the most brilliant of which was the Panegyricus, on which he is said to
have spent ten years. Hewas by nature timid and of weakly constitution, which
compelled him to refrain from political life and public speaking.

<note n="28"/> Demades: A man of brilliant oratorical powers, but an unprincipled demagogue and a leader of the Macedonian party in opposition to Demosthenes. He seems to have sold himself to Philip and his successors, and Plutarch calls him
the ruin (<foreign>ναυάγιον</foreign>) of his country. For Aeschines see Introduction, Note 11.
From the first he was a persistent advocate of peace with Philip almost at any
cost, not necessarily because he had been bribed so to do, though Demosthenes
charges him with this, but because of his weakness of character, which made
him an easy prey to the wiles of the crafty king, and led him to take the opposite
side to Demosthenes. Philocrates was another prominent member of the Philipizing party, at times proceeding to even greater lengths than Aeschines in playing into the hands of Philip, and ostentatiously displaying the wealth which he
had no doubt received as the price of his treason.
<pb n="p.298"/>

and Philocrates, out of sheer terror, surrender the city
and their own persons to Philip the very moment Philip
declared war, and didn’t they continue to carry out his
policy all the time at Athens? Accordingly, if any
other Athenian whatsoever made war after the same
fashion, he, too, was hail-fellow-well-met among them.
And there are Hyperides, Demosthenes and Lycurgus,
who, at any rate, had the reputation of being more
courageous than the rest, and in the popular assemblies
were forever raising aclamor against Philip and railing
at him—why, what on earth did they do in the way of
noble deeds during the war against him? Yes, and
Hyperides<ref n="29"/>  and Lycurgus didn’t even go forth into the
field; nay, they didn’t muster up courage enough to
take even a wee bit of a peep outside the gates, but remained quietly within the walls at their houses, framing
petty motions and decrees, though already in a state of
siege. And the very chiefest one among them, who
was everlastingly repeating this expression in the popular assemblies—“Philip, the Macedonian pest, from
whom one would never purchase even a slave”—he
had courage enough to advance into Boeotia, but before
the armies joined battle and were engaged in hand-tohand combat, he actually threw away his shield and fled.
Or, perhaps, you have never before heard anybody tell
this story, quite notorious though it is, among not only

against the enemy, yet Simon's charge that their courage was only that of the
forum is wholly gratuitous. Baal unwarranted is the imputation upon the
conduct of Damosthenes at the battle of Charonea, He was a member of the
heavy-armed troops, and fell back with the rest of his defeated countrymen before the superior discipline and equipment of the Macedonians. His political

whom that outcast had his origin?<ref n="30"/>

</p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="43">
<p><label>Tychiades</label> Yes, I’m acquainted with it. But these
men were rhetoricians, trained in speech making, and
not in courage.—But what have you to say of the philosophers? Surely you cannot bring against them the
same accusations as against the former.</p>

<p><label>Parasite</label> Why, my dear Tychiades, it will appear that
these in their turn, the topic of whose daily conversation is manliness, and who fairly wear out the name of
virtue, are far more cowardly and effeminate than the
rhetoricians. Note the following considerations. In
the first place, there is no one who can name a philosopher who died in war. For, in sooth, they never did
go to the field at all, or even if they did, they all took
to their heels. There’s Antisthenes,<ref n="31"/> for example, and
Diogenes and Crates and Zeno and Plato and Aischines
and Aristotle, and all that crowd—they never even saw
a line of battle. The only one of them who had the
pluck to go out to the battle at Delium was the wise
Socrates,<ref n="32"/> and he fled thence from Mt. Parnes and took
refuge in the wrestling school of Taureas. For it
seemed to him far more delightful to sit down and chat
with the youngsters and propound sophisms to any
chance listeners, than to fight a Spartan.</p>

<p><label>Tychiades</label> My good sir! I’ve heard these things before
from others also, who surely had no wish to scoff at and
cast reproach upon the philosophers. Accordingly, I
do not believe that partiality for your own art has led

<note n="30"/> From whom that outcast had his origin: One of the many charees by which
the adversaries of Demosthenes sought to discredit him was the claim that he
was not a genuine Hellene, but a foreigner and semibarbarian, The only basis
for this was the fact that his grandmother on his mother’s side was a Scythian
woman, who married an Athenian exile, who had settled near the Cimmerian
Bosporus, north of the Euxine Sea. They had two daughters, who came to
Athens and wedded Attic citizens, one of them the father of the orator. Snch
unions were not uncommon in the Greek colonies on the Black Sea, and not a
few distinguished Athenians hada strain of Thracian or Scythian blood in their
pedigree, e. g., Cimon, Thucydides, the historian, and possibly Themistocles.
Aristotle was only half a Greek.

<note n="31"/> Antisthenes and Crates: See Dial. a Dead, 27, notes 2and 3, For Diogenes, see Dial. of Dead, 1, note 1. Zeno (344-260 B. C.) was founder of the Stoic

Plato, see Dial. of Dead, 20, note 26.

<note n="32"/> Socrates: At Delium, the Athenians met a disastrous defeat (424 B. C.) at the
hands of the Boeotians. Socrates was on this occasion a member of the heavyarmed troops, and, contrary to Simon's assertion, distinguished himself for his

repulsed the pursuing cavalry.

<p><label>Parasite</label> Really, my dear friend, there’s nobody so
ignorant of Homer, or so utterly uncultivated, as not
to know, that, in his judgment, the most distinguished
of his heroes were parasites. For instance, there’s the
famous Nestor,<ref n="33"/> from whose tongue speech flowed just
like honey—he was parasite to the king himself, and
neither Achilles, who was reputed to be and actually
was most noble in person and most righteous, nor Diomedes, nor Ajax, did Agamemnon<ref n="34"/>  praise and admire
so much as he did Nestor. For, mind you, he doesn’t
wish that he had ten men like Ajax, or ten like
Achilles; but he declares that Troy would have been
taken long before if he had had ten such soldiers<ref n="35"/>  as
this parasite, though he wasanold man. And in like
manner Idomeneus, who traced his descent to Zeus,
Homer speaks of as a parasite of Agamemnon’s.</p>

of honor, to banquet at the king’s table. Idomeneus
and Nestor used to dine every day with the king, as I
myself maintain. But Nestor, to my thinking, was of
all the kings par excellence a clever and accomplished
parasite. For he, we are told, began the art not in the
time of Agamemnon, but away back in the days of
Caeneus and HExadius;<ref n="36"/> and, I presume, he would never
have given up being a parasite had it not been for the

whit the inferior of any one of the other Greeks, either
in soul or in body, albeit he was a young man? For
I, methinks, can judge by his exploits that he was not
inferior even to Achilles himself. For, when Hector
broke through the gates of the Grecian campand fought
within, near the ships, Patroclus thrust him out and
quenched the flames with which the ship of Protesilaus<ref n="38"/>
was already in a blaze, and yet those on board of her
were not by any means the commonest sort of soldiers,
but Ajax and Teucer, sons of Telamon, the one excellent as a man-at-arms, the other as an archer. And he

from the tyranny under which she groaned, and now
there stands in the market place a bronze statue of him,
with his favorite nearby. Now these men, illustrious
as you see they are, were parasites.</p>

not otherwise, for whomsvever Odysseus bids fight in
battle, though it should be necessary to fight at the very
break of day, he will fortify beforehand with a hearty
meal. And while in the case of other soldiers, under
the stress of fear one is putting his helmet in order, and
another is donning his coat of mail, and a third is shaking in his shoes, as he gets an inkling of the danger
itself that belongs to war, at that very moment the parasite is banqueting with right joyous countenance; but
immediately upon marching to the field of conflict, he
fights desperately among the foremost. Whereas, the
one who gives him his support posts himself behind the
parasite, who covers him with his shield, just as Ajax
did Teucer,<ref n="43"/> and protects him from the flying missiles

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="50">
<p rend="merge">But suppose now, that a
parasite should actually fall in battle, of course, neither
captain, nor fellow-soldier would have occasion to be
ashamed of him, he would make such a fine large
corpse, and look so strikingly handsome, lying outstretched, as though at a banquet. For it is well worth
while, by way of contrast, to notice the dead body of a
philosopher lying near him—a lean, slovenly, weakly
fellow, with a long beard, who died before the battle
was fairly begun. Who, then, would not despise the
state whose defenders, he sees, are such a wretched lot?
And who would fail to conclude, at sight of the tallowfaced, long-haired little men lying there, that the state,
because it was in want of allies, had set free for use in
war the criminals in its penitentiary? Well, that’s the
sort of men parasites are in war, as compared with rhetoricians and philosophers.</p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="51">
<p rend="merge">In peace, on the other
hand, parasitism seems to me as much superior to pbilosophy as peace itself is to war. And first, if you
please, let us consider the places where peace has her
abode.</p>

<p><label>Tychiades</label> But I don’t yet make out what in the world
you mean by this. All the same, let us proceed to consider them.</p>

<p><label>Parasite</label> Well, then, there’s the market place, the
courts of justice, the wrestling and gymnastic schools,
hunting establishments and banquet halls—may I not
speak of them as places belonging to a city?</p>

<p><label>Tychiades</label> Certainly!</p>

<p><label>Parasite</label> Well, now, the parasite will not so much as
enter a market place, or the courts of justice, because,
I presume, all such places belong rather to false accusers, and a total lack of moderation is characteristic
of all that goes on there. But he seeks the wrestling
and gymnastic schools and the banquet halls, and is
their sole adornment. For what philosopher or rhetorician, when stripped naked at a wrestling school, is
worthy of comparison physically with a parasite? Or
who among them, when he appears at a gymnasium,
doesn’t rather reflect disgrace upon the place? Moreover in a wilderness, not one of them would stand his
<pb n="p.305"/>

ground against a wild beast when it came to close quarters with him. Whereas, the parasite stands fast
and awaits their attack with equanimity, because he
has habituated himself to make light of them at the
dinners he attends, and neither stag nor bristly wild
boar frightens him; but even if the boar does whet his
tooth against him, the parasite also whets his tooth in
turn against the boar. Why, he is more given to hunting hares than hounds are. And, then, at a banquet,
who, forsooth, can quite compete with a parasite in
cracking jokes, or as a bon vivant? And who can furnish more delight to his boon companions?—the man who
is always ready with song and jest, or a fellow who
never laughs, but reclines at table in a coarse cloak of
scant pattern and keeps his eyes fixed upon the ground,
just as though he had come toa funeral, and not toa
banquet? To my thinking, at least, a philosopher in
a banquet hall cuts just such a figure asadog in a
bathing establishment.</p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="52">
<p rend="merge">Well, leaving these matters, let us proceed at once to consider the parasite’s life
itself, and at the same time compare it with the one
already referred to. In the first place, then, one will
observe, that the parasite always holds reputation in
contempt and cares nothing at all for what men think
of him; whereas, in the case of rhetoricians and philosophers, one will find all of them, without exception,
consumed with vanity and a thirst for reputation, and
not for reputation only, but—what is more disgraceful
than this—for money also. The parasite looks upon
silver with just as much indifference as a person would
even upon the pebbles on the beach, and as for gold, it
seems to him no different from fire. Rhetoricians,
however, and—what is more dreadful—even those
who profess to be philosophers, are possessed with such
a wretched thirst for these things, that of the most distinguished philosophers of the present day—-for why
need I speak of the rhetoricians?—whoever has a case
to decide, makes no bones of taking a bribe for his decision; while another demands remuneration from a
king for the privilege of his society and is not ashamed
of going, even in his old age, to foreign parts for this
<pb n="p.306"/>

purpose and of serving for hire,<ref n="44"/> just like any Indian or
Scythian captive in war—yes, and is not even ashamed
at the very name itself, which he receives.</p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="53">
<p rend="merge">And
not only will you find these things appertaining to
them, but that they are given to other passions also,
such as grief, anger, jealousy, and all manner of lusts.
The parasite, however, is free from all these, for he
never gets angry, owing to his patient forbearance and
because he has no one with whom he can fly into a passion; and if he should ever be angry, his anger leads to
no painful or melancholy result, but rather occasions
laughter and puts his companions in good humor.
From grief, moreover, he suffers even least of all, for
his art secures to him and freely bestows exemption
from anything which would occasion him distress. For
he has no money, nor house, nor house-slave, nor wife,
nor children, the loss of which must inevitably give
pain to their possessor. And his heart is not set upon
glory or wealth; nay, not even upon beauty.</p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="44">
<p><label>Tychiades</label> But, Simon, it is at ‘least fair to presume that lack of the means of living causes him many
a worry.</p>

<p><label>Parasite</label> You forget, my dear Tychiades, that the man
who is at a loss for his daily bread is from the start not
a parasite. .A brave man, you know, ceases to bejbrave
the moment his courage fails him, and a prudent man
is no longer prudent when he loses his wits. On the
same principls, a man would not bea parasite if the
means of living should fail him. But the question before us concerns what a parasite actually is, not what
he is not. If now it is only the actual presence of courage that constitutes the brave man and only the actual
presence of sagacity that constitutes the prudent man,
so also the parasite will be truly such only when he is
actually engaged in playing the parasite. Since, if this
characteristic does not really belong to him, the subject
of our inquiry will prove to be not a parasite, but somebody else.

<note n="44"/> Serving for hiro: The earlier philosophers regarded it as finconsistent with
their professions to tale fees for instruction. Aristippus is said to have been the
first of the disciples of Socrates to take pay. In Lucian’s day they had become
more mercenary, and no doubt many of them by their Sings eet justified
his trenchant criticisms upon the wide discrepancies between their practice and
their preaching.
<pb n="p.307"/>

</p>

<p><label>Tychiades</label> Well, then, does a parasite never lack for
the means of living?</p>

<p><label>Parasite</label> Itappears not. Accordingly, he has no occasion to worry, either on this score or on any other.</p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="55">
<p>Moreover, also, philosophers and rhetoricians live
one and all in the greatest fear. The most of them, at
the very least calculation, will be found carrying a club
as they walk abroad—and of course, they wouldn’t go
armed in this way were they not afraid. Yes, and
they bar their doors very stoutly, because they are apprehensive that somebody is going to spring a plot upon
them by night. But the parasite shuts the door of his
chamber just as it happens, and that merely to prevent
the wind from opening it; and if a noise is made at
night, he is nomore disturbed about it than if there
had been no noise at all; and when he goes through a
desert country, he travels without any sword, for he
isn’t at all afraid anywhere. But philosophers, I’ve
ofttimes before now seen armed with bows, when there
was no danger whatever. Why, they have their clubs
with them, even when they go to the bath, or.to breakfast.</p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="56">
<p rend="merge">Furthermore, nobody can accuse a parasite
of adultery, or of any act of violence or robbery, or of
anything else whatsoever in the way of wrongdoing,
for indeed sucha reprobate wouldn’t bea parasite—nay,
he does himself a wrong. Therefore, if by any chance
he has committed adultery, at the very moment of its
commission he exchanges his name for the one derived
from the crime itself. Just asthe base man does not
have given him the name “good,’” but “bad” rather,
so, in my opinion, the parasite, if he does any wrong,
loses his own special name and receives that which is
appropriate to the wrong that he does. Such offenses
not only we ourselves know have been committed in
abundance by rhetoricians and philosophers in our own
day, but also in books we have records left us of their
evil deeds. There’s the plea that Socrates made<ref n="45"/>  in

<note n="45"/> The plea that Socrates made: Referring to his “ Apology,” or defense, before
the court which condemned him to death. The plea of Atschines may refer

brought against him, of having been bribed and of having betrayed the interests

of his country. Inthe case of Demosthenes, Simon probably had in mind his
oration on the Crown, in which he defends himself against Aischines.

<pb n="p.308"/>

his own defense, and the pleas of Aischines and Hyperides and Demosthenes, and of well-nigh the majority
of rhetoriciansand philosophers; but there isno defense
extant, that a parasite has had to make, nor can any
one say that anybody has ever brought an action
against a parasite.</p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="57">
<p rend="merge">Well, depend upon it, the life
of the parasite is superior to that of rhetoricians and
philosophers; but how about his death? Is that more
miserable than theirs? Quite the contrary; his death is
far happier. For weknow that all philosophers—or the
most of them—base that they are, have met a base
death; some by poison, to which they were sentenced,
because convicted of the greatest crimes; others had
their whole body burned up; others still died in exile.
But no one can mention a parasite who departed this
life in any such way. On the contrary, his is a most
happy death,'in the midst of eating and drinking. But
if some parasite even apparently met a violent end, it
was an attack of indigestion that really proved the
death of him.</p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="58">
<p><label>Tychiades</label> Well, we’ve had enough of your hot
contention in behalf of parasites as compared with philosophers. But, further, I challenge you to show
whether this piece of property isa source of honor and
a profitable investment to him who supports him. To
my thinking, men of wealth are, as it were, benefactors
to support such folks, and do it out of pure benevolence,
and it is a disgrace to him who gets his living in that
way.</p>

<p><label>Parasite</label> How very stupid it is of you, my dear Tychiades, if you‘ean’t understand that a rich man, though
he has the gold of Gyges,<ref n="46"/> is poor, if he has to eat all
by himself, and that if he walks abroad without a parasite by his ‘side, he has the air of a beggar; and just
as a soldier without arms, ora robe devoid of purple,
or a horse without metal bosses upon his headgear, is
held in less honor, so alsoa wealthy man without a
parasite, is to all appearance, a sort of mean, paltry,
fellow. Besides, the parasite is an ornament to the rich
man, whereas, the latter is never an ornament to the

<note n="46"/> Gyges: A Lydian king, of the same dynasty with Croesus, whom he preceded
by ae one hundred and thirty years. “The riches of, Gyges’ became a
proverb.
<pb n="p.309"/>

former.</p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="59">
<p rend="merge">Moreover, it is not, as you claim, even
a reproach to him, an inferior, to play the parasite to
one who is evidently his superior, since it is nevertheless to the advantage of the rich man to support the
parasite; for, indeed, along with the honor which the
latter confers upon him, he also finds in this man’s protection ample security for himself. For no one, when
he sees the parasite standing at his side, would lightly
set upon a rich man in battle, and, on the otber hand,
a person who has a parasite would run no risk of dying
by poison. For who would undertake to plot against
the former, when the latter tastes beforehand of all the
food and drink? The rich man, therefore, is not only
honored by the presence of the parasite, but he is saved
from the greatest dangers. The parasite loves his
patron with such affection that he submits to every
hazard and would not leave the rich man to take his
dinner alone, but chooses to eat with him, even at the
risk of death itself.</p>

<p><label>Tychiades</label> Well, Simon, I think you’ve treated

have fallen into this mode of life used to tell me all
about it. Some of them were still in this wretched
thraldom and bitterly lamented the number and nature
of their trials; while others, now that they had fled
therefrom, as it were from a sort of prison, were not
unwilling to recount what they had suffered. Yes,
they actually took delight in recalling the troubles from
which they hadescaped. All the more worthy of belief

they were telling the story of some shipwreck and their
unlooked-for deliverance, after the manner of those who
stand hard by the temples, with their heads shaven.
You’ve heard such persons describe in graphic style,
many of them talking all at once, the huge waves and
surges, the projecting headlands, and how they had to
cast the cargo overboard, the repeated breaking of the
mast and snapping of the rudders. And, to crown all,
they tell how the Dioscuri<ref n="4"/>  suddenly put in an appearance—for they, you know, are appropriately associated
with such a tragedy—or how some other deus ex
machina came and sat upon the masthead or took his
stand at the rudders and steered the vessel toward
some soft beach, and how, after being borne thither, she
was destined to go to pieces gradually and by slow degrees, while they themselves would land in safety by
the favor and grace of the god. Those people, however, are in the habit of exaggerating the most of their
adventures for their own immediate advantage, in order that they may get more persons to give them alms,
because they are reputed to be not only unfortunate,
but also sort of dear to the gods.</p>

how at first they sailed on with the sea apparently calm

voyage, as a whole, from thirst or seasickness, or from
being water-logged, and finally how they wrecked
their unlucky little craft upon some sunken rock or precipitous headland and, miserably wretched, swam off
naked and in want of all the necessaries of life. In

conceal the most of their experiences out of shame, and
to be willing to forget them. But putting together both
their own statements and whatever else since the conversation I find appertaining to such companionshipgy, I,
for my part, shall not scruple, my good Timocles, to give
you all the particulars about them. For methinks I’ve
observed you for a long time now harboring designs
upon this mode of life.</p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="3">
<p>Well, to begin with, when the conversation
chanced to turn in that direction, some one of those
present expressed his approval of hiring oneself out in
this way. He affirmed that they are thrice happy who
have the most distinguished Romans as their friends
and enjoy costly dinners, all without expense to themselves, and live in a splendid house, and, should occasion require, travel in a carriage with white horses,<ref n="6"/> with
all possible ease and pleasure, and with the head
haughtily thrown back, and at the same time get a
handsome salary besides, as friend of the family and
in return for the benefits which the latter receive.
For all things, he declared, grow for such people absolutely without any sowing or tilling of the soil.<ref n="7"/>  When,
therefore, you heard these and such-like statements, I
noticed how you were all agape at them and had your
mouth stretched wide open, ready for the bait. That
we, then, on our part may henceforth be ‘guiltless, and
that you may not have it to say that we saw you swallowing such a big fishhook, shrimp and all, and yet
didn’t seize and draw it away before it got into your
gullet, nor pointed it out to you clearly, but waited,
the hook meanwhile being drawn backward and having already become firmly lodged, and beheld you trailing along after it and carried away perforce, when,
now that there was no help for it, we stood and wept, —
that you, I say, may never have any reasonable ground
whatever, or one from which we cannot escape, for
such an allegation—in case you do make it—listen! for
we do no wrong in showing up the matter beforehand.
Listen, I entreat you, to a full account from the begin-

ning; and from a safe place upon the outside—not
from the inmost corner within—take a leisurely survey
beforehand of the net itself. Note the absence of any
outlet to the weels, yes, and also the curve of the fishhook and how its point bends backward. And then
take in your hands the points of the three-pronged fish
spear and try them against your jaw, distended as in
the case of one going to be shaved. Then, if you do
not find them very sharp, or admitting of no escape, or
painful in the wounds that they make, as they draw
you along by force and irresistibly lay hold of you—
why, set me down as a coward and a starveling, bid
yourself be of good cheer and then fall upon the prey,
if you want to, just as the sea-mew, with wide-open
mouth, swallows the bait whole.</p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="4">
<p>The whole story will be told entirely perhaps for
your benefit. It will, however, have to do not only
with you, professional philosophers, who have deliberately adopted a course of life of a more serious tone,
but also with schoolmasters, rhetoricians and men of
letters; with those, in short, who for hire consent to
serve as tutors in the families of the rich. Asall, upon
the whole, have a common lot and the things that befall them are similar, evidently philosophers have no
exceptional experience, but a more disgraceful one, although the same as that of the rest, in case they should
be deemed worthy of the same treatment with the others,
and their employers should regard them with no greater
respect. Whatever, therefore, the narrative itself may
bring to light as it proceeds, first and above all, they
who do these things are themselves justly to blame for
this, and, next, they who submit to such treatment.
Whereas, I am blameless, unless there is some penalty
for frankly telling the truth. As for those, however,
who make up the rest of the crowd, for example, trainers of athletes, flatterers, men without professional
knowledge, of small minds and mean in themselves, it
isn’t worth while to try and turn them away from such
companionships—for they wouldn’t obey. Nor, in
sooth, is it well to censure them, if they do not abandon their employers, notwithstanding the very many
insults they may receive from them—for they are
<pb n="p.315"/>

adapted to just such a mode of life and not unworthy
of it. And, besides, they wouldn’t have anything
else whatever to which they could turn and in which
they could make themselves effective. On the contrary, if one deprive them of this, they at once lose
their occupation and are idle and useless. So far,
then, as they are concerned, they would suffer nothing dreadful in being treated thus, nor would their
masters seem to be committing any outrage in putting,
as the saying has it, the spittoon to ifs intended use.
For surely from the very beginning of their service they
enter the houses of the rich with the intention of submitting to this outrageous treatment; and it is their trade
to endure and put up with whatever happens. But in
the case of the men of education already referred to, it
is meet for one to be vexed and to try, so far as one can,
to get them out of this bondage and set them free.</p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="5">
<p>I shall do well, I think, to examine first the reasons which lead some to enter upon such a life, and show
that they are not at all forcible or conclusive. Thus
their defense will be disproved by anticipation and also
the primary reason they give for their voluntary slavery. Confessedly the most of them plead their poverty
and want of the necessaries of life, and imagine that
they have thereby offered a sufficient excuse for going
over to that way of living; and they hold that it is
enough for their justification to say that they regard it
as a pardonable offense, if they seek to escape poverty,
that hardest-to-bear of all the experiences of life.
There’s a verse handy, of Theognis<ref n="8"/>  to the same effect,
one that is often quoted:

and all the other direful things the basest of the poets
have uttered concerning poverty. Now, if I saw that
these people were actually finding in such companionships any refuge from poverty, why! I should not, in
replying to them, dwell with such particularity upon
their lack of freedom. And since, as our fine orator

<note n="8"/> See Timon, note 45. He was
chief among the earlier Greek elegiac poets, sixth century B. C.
<pb n="p.316"/>

has somewhere said,<ref n="9"/> “they fare in the matter of food
just the same as sick folks,” is it not, moreover, beyond question, that in this respect also they have apparently made a foolish resolve, since their circumstances in life always remain at bottom thesame? For
they are in a chronic state of poverty and under the
necessity of accepting from others, and they have nothing laid by against a rainy day, nor any surplus to be
securely guarded; but whatever is given them, even if
given and received in a lump, is all spent frugally, and
yet proves insufficient for their need. It were well for
them not to be devising any such ways and means as
will prolong their poverty by giving it only temporary
aid, but such as will remove it altogether. Yes, instead of taking such a course, such a one, perhaps,
ought, as you say, Theognis, to cast himself into the
deep-yawning sea<ref n="10"/>  or down steep rocks. But if any
one, who is always poor and in want and serving for
hire, imagines that he is thereby out of all danger of
poverty, Ido not see why such a person should not be
regarded as self-deceived.</p>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="6">
<p>Others declare that they would not be frightened
or terrified at poverty itself, if they were able to provide barley-meal by toiling like other folks. But, as
it is—for their bodies, they say, are worn out either
from old age, or from the attacks of disease—they have,
they tell us, hired themselves out in this way as being
the easiest thing to do. Well, then, let us see, whether
they speak the truth and whether what is given accrues
to them in the easiest way without much labor on their
part, or at least with no more than what others expend.
Indeed, that would be like building castles in the air,
to expect to receive ready cash without having labored
or toiled. But their condition cannot be adequately
described. They have so much to do and to suffer in
their companionships, that, under such circumstances
and for such a purpose especially, they have all the
more need of health, for there are every day numberless
things that wear out the body and reduce them to utter
despair. But we will mention these at the proper time,

when we will also give a circumstantial account of
their other annoyances. For the present it is sufficient.
to have called attention to the fact, that even they who
allege this as the reason for selling themselves, do not
speak the truth.

7%. There remains another motive, and confessedly the
truest one, though they least often mention it, which
leads them to push their way into the houses of the
rich—namely, the pursuit of pleasure and the prospect
of realizing the many, ay, the crowd of hopes which
they cherish. They are amazed at the quantity of gold
and silver they see there; they enjoy the dinners and
the rest of the luxurious surroundings, and expect almost immediately to drink of the gold with mouth wide
open and no one to restrain them. These things draw
them on by degrees and at last make them slaves instead of free men—not the want of the necessaries of life,
as they allege, but the longing for the things that are not
necessary and the emulous desire for the many very
costly objects already referred to. Accordingly, their
patrons, who are sort of skilled and experienced in being
loved, after receiving them into their service, treat
them with contempt, just like infatuated, ill-starred
lovers passionately in love, in order to show them that
they will always be loved merely as their attendants;
but they give them no share in the peculiar privileges
of favorites—no, not even to the extent of the fag end of
akiss. For they know that the dissolution of the attachment is liable to occur at any moment, Therefore
they shut it up and jealously guard it. As for the rest,
they keep the lover all the time in a state of expectancy.
For they fear lest despair draw him away from his inordinate passion and he cease to have any love for
them. Accordingly, they smile upon bim and promise
that they will forever and ever treat him well and
gratify his desires, and take care of him with lavish
generosity. Meanwhile, all unawares, both parties
have become old and infirm—too old, the latter for bestowing love and the former for sharing it. In all
their life, therefore, the unhappy lovers have got no
further than the hope with which they set out.</p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="8">
<p>Indeed, for one to submit to everything because
<pb n="p.318"/>

he has his heart set upon pleasure, is perhaps not at all
culpable, but excusable rather, if he takes delight in
pleasure and pays court to her in every possible way, in
order to partake of her. And yet, perhaps, it is disgraceful and slavish for one to sell himself on her account. For much more delightful is the pleasure derived from freedom. Nevertheless, however, let such
a course be pardoned in their case, if it should turn out
weil. But to submit to many annoyances, merely because one hopes for pleasure is, I think, ridiculous and
silly, especially when men see that the sufferings to be
endured are in plain sight and manifest beforehand and
inevitable, while that which is hoped for, whatever in
the world the pleasure is, has not yet been realized,
though such a long time has passed, and besides, is not
likely to be realized, if one can judge from the facts of
the case. The comrades of Odysseus, you know, eating
the lotus,<ref n="11"/> which was sort of sweet, were careless about
everything else and, in comparison with present pleasure, held in contempt their true interests. Therefore,
not altogether irrational was their forgetfulness of what
was good, their soul being absorbed in that pleasure.
But that a person hungering for it should stand by the
side of another who is taking his fill of the lotus, but
does not share it with his neighbor, and that he should
attach himself to him from the mere hope of some time
getting a taste of it himself, having become oblivious
to what is good and right—how ridiculous, by Heracles,
such a course would be! Verily it would deserve blows
administered in sort of Homeric fashion.</p>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="9">
<p>These, then, are the motives—or as near 38 we can
get at them—which lead these people into such companionships, and because of which they precipitately
intrust themselves to the rich to do with them whatever
they please; unless some oneshould think fit to mention
those persons, also, who are elated even at the honor
merely of being with men of noble family and grandees. For there are thosealso who think, that this at-

<p>So much, then, for the purposes they have in view
in entering upon this mode of life. Let us now proceed
to consider between ourselves what they endure, before
they gain their end and are received into the house of
some nobleman, and how they are treated, now that
they have secured admission, and, above all, what is
the dénouement of the tragedy in which they are actors.
For certainly this at least cannot be said, that though
these things are bad, they are, at any rate, easy to
obtain and will not require much toil, but you need
only to wish for them and then you bave accomplished
the whole without trouble. On the contrary, there has
to be a great deal of running about from one to another,
and protracted waiting at the door of some great man.
You must rise early in the morning and wait and wait,
and then be thrust out and have the door shut in your
face. You get the reputation of being sometimes impudent and importunate and are ordered about by a
doorkeeper, who talks broken Syrian, or by an African
usher, whom you have to fee in order to get your name
announced. Moreover also, you have to be more particular in the matter of dress than your present means
warrant—to suit the rank of the person upon whom
you are waiting—and to select such adornments for
your own person as he will be pleased with, in order
that you may not be out of harmony with your surroundings or give offense, when he looks at you. And
then you must be indefatigable in dancing attendance
upon him, or rather in going before him, pushed forward
by the servants, and supplying, as it were, a sort of
escort for him. But for many days in succession he
doesn’t so much as glance in your direction.</p>

daily stipend of five obols,<ref n="16"/> and when also you have
succeeded in finding some god of tragedy who interests
himself in your behalf, then the next thing on the programme is a rigid examination as to your proficiency in
the various branches of knowledge. The delay occasions no annoyance to your rich patron, accustomed as
he is to be complimented and accounted happy, but to
you it seems as if at that moment a life-and-death
struggle were before you—one involving your entire
means of living. In all likelihood the thought comes
into your mind, that no one else will receive you into
his home, if you prove unable to stand the test and are
rejected by the first one whose patronage you seek.
Moreover, you inevitably suffer at such a time countless distractions; you are jealous of your competitors—

the same ends. You imagine, that you yourself have

beard and gray hair makes, undergoing examination as
to whether he knows anything useful, some of those
present thinking that he does know, while others think
he doesn’t. Meanwhile also your entire past life is
closely scrutinized. Even some fellow-citizen, out of

with scandalous practices, and his testimony has just

from staying up late nights; and you ought to have the

your patron took you in the beginning and which you

it would then be no great evil to stoop beneath and wear
a yoke that is so light, easily borne and, above all, overlaid with gold. But this ideal state is far from being
realized; nay, rather, it utterly fails of it. For numberless things, intolerable to a free man, occur in such

you!’ says he. ‘I accept itfrom you? God forbid!’
But after making a show of refusing, he is persuaded
at last and departs, grinning upon you from ear to ear.
You now provide yourself with a spotless suit of clothes,
and having taken a bath and decked yourself out as
becomingly as possible, you are on hand, anxious lest
you arrive before the other guests, for this would argue
ignorance of the proprieties, even as coming last smacks
of vulgarity. Well, you look out about this, and manage to get there when the affair is about half over.

watching to see how you will act. Even the old nabob
himself is not indifferent upon this point, but even tells
some of the servants beforehand to observe whether
from your place of vantage you often gaze in the direction of his wife and children. Why, even the attendants of your fellow-guests notice your bewilderment as
you watch the infinite variety of things that are being
done, and rally you upon it, regarding it as a sure
sign that you have never dined with anybody else before, and that the napkin laid by your plate is something quite novel to you. Naturally, and as a matter of

and cannot even pluck up courage enough to ask for
wine when you are thirsty, for fear you should be

such luxury; at another you commiserate yourself, as
you realize that you are a good-for-naught and yet are
in the land of the living. But sometimes this thought
also comes into your mind, that you are now going to
lead a pretty enviable life in the estimation of all these
people, as you are to live in luxury and share in every

that you are to be celebrating all the time a feast of
Dionysus ;<ref n="23"/> and perhaps also handsome lads, as they

wanting in this, that we must play second fiddle even

third. “Hardly five whole days will pass before you’ll

I should intrust to you the greatest interest I have, my
own soul, or even the souls of my children”—in case
he has children who require education—“and at the
same time should not consider you master of everything
else, upon equal terms with myself. Well, I suppose,
we must come to some definite understanding. I observe, though, how frugal you are in your habits and
content with what you have, and I quite understand
that you have come to our house from no mercenary
motives, but for other reasons, because of the friendship
we have for you and the honor everybody will pay you.
All the same, some definite amount must be decided
upon, I suppose. Well, my dear sir, please state what

holidays, which occur from time to time during the
year; for we shall not neglect even such matters, you
may be sure, although we do not now formally put it
down in the contract. There are many such occasions,
you know, in the course of the year. In view of these
considerations, then, you will no doubt place at a rather
moderate figure the salary you expect usto pay. It
would especially become you men of education to be
above mere pecuniary motives.”

know how to conduct yourself discreetly. Knowing as
I do many persons of distinction, who, even if they had
to pay a honus, would like to be companion to this man
for the mere name of the thing, and to be seen about
him and pass for his chums and friends, I know not
how I can congratulate you enough upon your good
fortune, when you also get a salary besides for such
happiness. Therefore, unless you are improvident, I

<p>You have to be content, allthe same. For it
would be no longer possible for you to run away, now
that you are already within the toils. Accordingly,
you shut your eyes and accept the bit, and at first are
easily led in conformity with it, not pulling it violently
around, but taking care not to get severely pricked by it,
until at last, without your knowing it, you become
accustomed to it. To be sure, people outside thenceforward envy you, as they see you living in court, going
in with no one to hinder, and that you have become one
of those who belong on the inside. But you yourself
do not yet see why you seem to them so happy.
However, you try to look on the bright side and deceive
yourself, and think all the time that things are going to
be better. But the contrary of what you expected
comes to pass, and, as the proverb has it, like the offering of Mandrobulus,<ref n="29"/> the thing continues to grow beautifully less day by day, so to speak, and goes backward

slowly and little by little in the dim light, as it were,

“For,” you say, “I do not see what there is that is so
painful in such companionships, nor do I perceive what
those experiences are which you spoke of as being
wearisome and intolerable.” Well, then, listen, my

mind you, all these things—family, freedom, ancestry—
you are to Jeave behind you on the outside whenever
you sell yourself and engage in such service. For freedom will not care to go in with you as you enter upon
such an ignoble and abject career. As a matter of
fact, then, you will be a slave, although greatly annoyed at the name, and necessarily a slave not of one,
but of many, and you will be a serf, stooping over from
early morn until evening, “all for scanty wages”; and
for the very reason, that you have not been bred to this
slavery from childhood, but have learned it only lately,
perhaps getting your education when pretty well along
in years, you will in nowise secure thereby the good
opinion of your master or be worth much to him. For
the memory of your former freedom, which comes over
you every now and then, demoralizes you and makes
you refractory at times, witl the result that you fare
badly in your thraldom, unless you fancy that, so far
as freedom is concerned, it is all sufficient for you that
you are not son of a Pyrrhias or Zopyrion<ref n="30"/>  and have not
been sold off, like some Bithynian, by a loud-voiced

Or suppose some one should take hold of you, and
march you off with the words—“ You are my slave”—

such treatment and boil with indignation? Heavens

sake of a few obols, at that time of life, when even if
you were born a slave, it would be high time for you
to be looking toward freedom, you have sold yourself,
wisdom, virtue and all, paying no heed to the many
elaborate disquisitions of the noble Plato,<ref n="31"/> Chrysippus,

of slavery. And are you not ashamed at being compared with flatterers, loungers in the market-place and

that you are driven by sheer want of means to resort to
such shifts? Well, evidently it is not the lack of water
or lupines, but the longing for sweetmeats and rich
fare and wine with a fine bouquet, that has led to your
being caught; like the bass, you have your deserts in
getting your throat itself pierced through and through,
because it reached after these things. As might be expected, right upon the heels of it comes the penalty for
this greediness. With a collar fastened about your
neck, as is the case with monkeys, you become a laughing-stock to others, while you think yourself faring
sumptuously, because you have an abundance of dried
figs<ref n="34"/>  with which to stuff yourself. But as for freedom

will get the reputation of being fond of Greek learning

good in education. And so, my good sir, it will quite
likely prove to be your beard and cloak that you have
hired out, instead of your wonderful learning. Accordingly, it behooves you to be seen with him all the time
and never to stay behind; but you must get up early in
the morning and present yourself, in order to be observed among his suite, and it won’t do to leave your
post. He sometimes places his hand familiarly upon
your shoulder and indulges in foolish talk upon whatever topic happens to occur to him, thus showing to

you have not even a place where you can sit down, and,
being at a loss what to do with yourself, you pull out
your book and try to read, standing bolt upright. And
when night overtakes you, without your having had a
bite or a drink of anything all day, after taking a bath

somewhere about midnight itself, you make your appearance at the dinner table, where you are no longer
held in equal honor by those present, nor are you the
cynosure of all eyes. But if some one else, even a
younger person, comes in after you, you have to give
place to him, and so being thrust back into the meanest

sheer hunger glad to eat, as though it were a rare

they garnish the other viands, in case it should be overlooked by those who sit above you at the table. Yes,
and the other ways in which it is possible to subject a
person to indignity, are by no means wanting. You
are the only one who is not allowed an egg, for you
must not expect to have always the same fare with
guests and strangers—that, you know, would be a piece
of presumption on your part. The fowl set before you
isn’t as good as the others; your neighbor’s is plump
and fat, whereas yours is a young chicken—and half a
one at that—or a somewhat tough pigeon, a downright
insult and disgrace. Nay, oftentimes, ifan additional
guest is unexpectedly present and there is nothing else
to be had, the waiter incontinently takes the dishes
lying near you and sets them before him, whispering to
you in an undertone—“You are one of us, you know.”
‘Yes, and when dinner is half through and they carve

standing near him who sits above you, until he has got
his filland allows it to pass on to the next, while it
hurries by you with such speed—why, what free man
would submit to it, even though he isno more susceptible of anger than are deer? And here’s another thing
I have not yet mentioned. While the rest are drinking
very sweet wine that has been kept many years, you

them with fat. Upon Zeus exitiolaing the manner in which he had made the

shame you slink away and lie hid in a retired corner of

lament and commiserate yourself and blame fortune,

popular they are. Yes, you would submit to it, even
if it should be necessary to play the part of a wizard or

disagreeable, and well-nigh worthy of being avoided;

<p>By the way, I’ve no scruples about relating to
you that incident which Thesmopolis, our Stoic friend
here, told me happened to him. Right laughable it
was, too, and I’ll take my oath not at all unlikely to
occur again to some one else—the very same thing.
Well, he once lived in the house of a wealthy woman
of luxury, in fact, one of the distinguished ladies of the
city. She had occasion once to takea journey from
home for the first time, when, he told me, he had the
following most laughable experience. Although he was
himself a philosopher, a sort of lewd fellow was given
a seat near him, a smooth-shaven man, one of those
chaps who pride themselves upon their effeminacy.
She, as you might expect, held him in honor; and
Thesmopolis told me the name of the gay Lothario—he
said it was Chelidonion. Now, you can well imagine,
to begin with, what a grotesque effect it had, that beside an old gentleman with an air of melancholy and a
venerable beard—for you know what a heavy and imposing beard Thesmopolis had—there should be seated a
fellow bedizened with rouge and painted underneath
the eyelids, unsteady in look and with neck bent double
—nota swallow,<ref n="44"/> in sooth, but a sort of vulture, with



<note n="44"/> Not a swallow: <foreign>χελιδόνα</foreign>, a play upon his name, Chelidonion, which means
“little swallow.” The effeminate fellow had received a name common among
the hetaerae. See Dial. of Gods, 20, note 11.
<pb n="p.338"/>

the feathers of his beard all plucked off; and indeed
Thesmopolis assured me, that if he himself hadn’t earnestly begged of him not to do it, he would have sat
there with a woman’s coiffure upon his head. As for
the rest, Thesmopolis told me that during the entire
journey he had to put up with countless annoyances. The
fellow sang and whistled, and had not my friend himself checked him, he would perhaps have even danced
right there in the wagon. 

</p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="34">
<p>However, this wasn’t all; but, according to
Thesmopolis’ account, the following extraordinary duty
was assigned him. Her ladyship calling him to her—
“My dear Thesmopolis,” says she, “I have a great
favor to ask—please grant it! Now, don’t refuse me
anything, I entreat, nor wait until I’m in still greater
need of your services—so may God bless you!” Upon
his promising to do anything and everything for her—
which indeed was quite natural under the circumstances
—she continued :-—“ Well, this is what I want of you.
I have noticed how trusty you are and attentive and
affectionate. You know my dog, Myrrhina. Now I
want you to take her up with you into the wagon, and
look out for her and see to it that she lacks for nothing.
She’s in great pain, poor thing! and in fact very near
her accouchement. But those accursed disobedient
servants of mine don’t trouble themselves much about
her, or about myself, for that matter, while we are traveling. Do not, then, imagine that it is only a trifling
favor you will confer upon me by carefully watching
over my pet dog—the little creature is awful sweet, you
know, and much sought after.” She pleaded so earnestly, all but with tears even, that Thesmopolis promised her. It was too funny for anything. There was
the diminutive dog just peeping out of the philosopher’s
cloak from beneath his beard, yelping every now and
then, and—though Thesmopolis didn’t add this—barking with her weak little voice, for that’s the way with
Maltese lap-dogs, and licking the philosopher’s beard,
especially if any of his yesterday’s soup had got mixed
in with it. And indeed his companion, the gay fellow, who was in the habit—and not without genuine
wit—of poking fun at the other guests present at the
<pb n="p.339"/>

dinner table, said, when on a subsequent occasion he
made merry at the expense of poor Thesmopolis—“I
have,” said he, “this only to say concerning our
friend, Thesmopolis here; instead of a Stoic he has
lately become a Cynic.”<ref n="45"/>  At all events, I learned that
the lap dog had actually brought forth a litter of puppies in the cloak of Thesmopolis.</p>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="35">
<p>Thus they mock at, or rather insult, the scholars
who live with the great, and by their wanton insolence
gradually make them submissive. I know also a rhetorician, one of the satirical sort, who at the dinner referred to was called upon to speak, and who had gotten
up a speech, which, upon my oath, showed no lack of
education, but was exceedingly clear and pithy. At
all events, he was applauded right in the midst of the
drinking, and the length of time he was speaking was
determined not in the ordinary way, by the use of the
water-clock,<ref n="46"/> but by the time it took to dispose of a jar

approbation. Then, again, there are those who wish to
be admired for beauty, and these ought to hear themselves called Adonises<ref n="48"/>  and Hyacinthuses, though they

him to the king of Corinth, who reared him as his own son. As the boy came to
manhood, he was seized with misgivings as to his origin. Consulting the oracle
at Delphi, he was told not to return home, else he would kill his father and
marry his mother. Lest this should come to pass, he resolved never to go back

the sketch merely, which I will give you to the best of
my ability. Well, here it is.</p>

<p>Picture to yourself a lofty gateway, overlaid with
gold, and situated, not down upon the level ground, but
up above the earth, on the crest of a hill, the approach
to which is long, steep and slippery, so that many a
one who hoped to be soon at the summit, misses his
footing and plunges headlong into destruction. Within
let Plutus<ref n="65"/>  himself be seated, to all appearance made
entirely of gold, exceeding fair of form and lovely.
And his devoted lover, who has toiled his way up and
at last has reached the gate, shall stand in blank astonishment as he gazes at the gold. Hope, herself, also
fair of face and dressed in broidered garments, shall
take him by the hand and conduct him within, while
his astonishment increases with every step of his progress, Thenceforth Hope shall ever go first and lead
the way, while other women, Guile and Servitude,
receiving him in their turn, shall deliver him over to
Toil, who after giving the poor wretch plenty of hard
work, shall intrust him at last to Old Age, by this
time rather sickly, and his complexion, alas! how
altered! Then, last of all, let Contumely seize and
hail him before Despair; and Hope shall take wing,
unseen from this time on. The poor lover shall now be
thrust out, not through the golden portal by which he
came in, but out of some hidden back door, a naked,
pot-bellied, pale old man, with his left hand covering
his shame, and with the right tightly compressing his
throat. As he goes forth, let Repentance meet him,
weeping unavailingly and fairly killing the miserable
man besides. Such shall be the closing scene in my
painting.</p>

<p>I adjure you, then, my dear Timocles, to carefully examine for yourself these considerations in detail and
reflect here and now whether it is well for you to enter
the palace of Plutus by this portal, as in the painting,
only to be thus ignominiously driven out by that rear
door. But whatever you do, remember what the wise
man says:

significance and instability of all things human—I
mean riches, official station, and power—I despised
them, and recognizing that the effort spent upon these
objects left no leisure for those which are really worth
one’s serious attention, I essayed to lift up my head and
command a view of the universe. And right here at
the outset this cosmos itself, as it is called by the philosophers, occasioned me not a little bewilderment.
For I was unable to discover either how it came into
being, or its maker, its origin, or what the consummation of itis. And then, on looking at it piecemeal, I
was forced into much greater perplexity. For I saw
the stars ‘scattered at haphazard in the heavens, and I
longed to know what in the world the sun itself really
was. But especially the phenomena pertaining to the
moon appeared to me extraordinary and altogether paradoxical, and I reached the conclusion that the cause of
the variety in her phases was quite inscrutable. Nay,
more, lightning, darting athwart the sky, and thunder,
bursting forth, rain, snow or hail descending—these too,
were all hard to make out and inexplicable.</p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="5">
<p rend="merge">Accordingly, since I was in such a state of ignorance, I
assumed that the best thing to do was to get a complete
explanation of each one of these phenomena from the
philosophers here. For I thought, that they at least
would be able to tell me all the facts in the case.
Having picked out the best of them, so far indeed as it
was possible to judge by sadness of countenance,<ref n="11"/> sallowness of skin and length of beard—for these men at
the moment seemed to me sort of grandiloquent and
able to interpret the heavens—I put myself into their
hands, with considerable cash, paying part of it down
on the spot and agreeing to pay the rest afterward in
return for the sum and substance of their wisdom. I
then demanded to be trained as a star-gazer and to understand the orderly arrangement of the universe.
But, after all, so far were they from ridding me of my
former ignorance, that they quickly plunged me into
even greater perplexities, showering daily upon me first

principles, final canses, atoms, vacuums, matters and
archetypes. But what to me at least seemed most embarrassing of all was this—although there was no consistency in what they said the one to the other, but all
their teachings were at loggerheads and contradictory,
nevertheless they expected me to obey them and endeavored to bring me over each to his own view.</p>

<p><label>Friend</label> That’s an extraordinary statement of yours
that, notwithstanding their wisdom, they were at odds
among themselves respecting these teachings, and did
not entertain the same opinions concerning the same
things.</p>

<p><label>Menippus</label> Nay, more, my friend, you will laugh
when you hear of their quackery and the love of the
marvelous that characterizes their teachings. Yor, in
the first place, although they walk upon the earth and
in no respect overtop us who go upon the ground—no,
not even possessing a keener sight than their neighbor,
while some of them are purblind through old age or
laziness, nevertheless they would affirm that they clearly
discerned the limits of heaven, and they would measure
the circumference of the sun, and take their stand upon
the regions above the moon; and as though they had
come down from the stars, they would describe in detail
their dimensions and phases; and often, should there be
occasion for it, although they didn’t know even the exact distance from Megara<ref n="12"/>  to Athens, they would have
the presumption to tell how many cubits long was the
space between the moon and the sun, measuring off the
heights of the air, the depths of the sea, and the circuits
of the earth. Moreover, by drawing circles and forming triangles upon squares and a sort of complex arrangement of revolving spheres,<ref n="13"/> they would, forsooth,
measure heaven itself! 7%. In the second place, this
also is assuredly nonsensical and absolutely crazy on
their part—the fact that when speaking of things so
obscure, they state no opinion as a mere conjecture,

of asphere inscribed in a cylinder was placed upon his tomb. Posidonius, a
contemporary of Cicero, also constructed a planetary machine.

but both go to all lengths in their assertions, and leave
to the others no opportunity to get ahead of them.
They all but declare on oath, that the sun is a red-hot
mass of metal,<ref n="14"/> that the moon is inhabited, that the
stars imbibe water, and the sun draws up the moisture
from the sea, as it were, with a kind of well rope, and
distributes the drink to them all equally one after
another.</p>

<p rend="merge">Now, it isan easy matter to discern how
great contrariety there is in their teachings. And pray,
consider whether their dogmas are of like kind and not

respecting the gods, since in the view of some, number
was the very deity,<ref n="21"/> while others were wont to swear by

universe to one alone,<ref n="23"/> so that I actually felt somewhat

Others, again, in their extravagance, would represent
them as numerous, and making distinctions among
them, they would call some particular one the first god,<ref n="24"/>

keeping everything in a constant state of flux and warring motion and change.
Ultimately all things return to and are absorbed again in this fire.

<note n="21"/> Number was the very deity: The Pythagoreans regarded number as the
original pre by means of which the ene and constitution of the universe
were to be explained, just as other systems of philosophy found the explanation
in fire, earth, air or water. In their view, according to Aristotle, number is the
essence of all things; numbers are the cause of the existence of all other things,
including the changes to which they are liable and their permanent conditions,
and are even things themselves.

school, held to the unity of the deity.

<note n="24"/> The first god: Plato and the Stoics taught that there was one supreme deity,
eternal and unchangeable, with other subordinate deities, destitute of these
attributes. Perhaps Lucian had in mind the teachings of a contemporary philosopher, Numenius, of Apamia in Syria, who distinguished a first god, existng absolutely, in and by himself, apart from the universe, a second god, whose
Sphere is creation and who keeps matter together. This second one is again
differentiated into a third.

makes heaven accessible by means of eagles and beetles,

to me that I myself could never by any contrivance
grow wings. But if I should put on the wings of a vulture or an eagle—for evidently these alone would correspond to the size of a man’s body—I imagined I
could perhaps succeed in my attempt. And what is
more, I caught the birds and cut off the right wing of
the one and the other of the vulture. I then bound
them around me right firmly and fastened them to my
shoulders with strong leathern straps; and at the tips of
the long quill feathers I arranged sort of hafts for my
hands. And at first I put my powers to the test by
jumping up in the air and rowing with my hands just
behind and by raising myself up, near the ground still,

Don’t be surprised! For when I cast myself heels over

dew. Accordingly, I’ve come to release you from your

already that when I came up here, I didn’t take out
my own and substitute for them the eagle’s two eyes.

only half an outfit, and not equipped in all respects

possess right off one of the king’s eyes. For if you’ll
rise up a little and without moving the vulture’s wing,
will flap the other only, you’ll become sharp-sighted in
your right eye, according to the law of that wing. For
the other eye, because it belongs to the inferior side,
cannot possibly avoid being very dull of sight.”,—“It
will suffice,” said I, “though only the right one should
see in eagle fashion. For I should be no worse off than
the carpenters. I think I’ve often seen them adjust
timbers to the levels to better advantage with one eye.”

slowly dissolved in smoke, 15. The very moment I
flapped the wing, an exceeding great light shone around
me, and the objects which had meanwhile lain concealed, all came in plain sight. Anyway, as I stooped
down toward the earth, I beheld clearly the cities, the
men, and what was going on—not only what people
were doing under the open sky, but what they were

Poulos times that followed his death the work was abandoned. Two centuries later King Antiochus Epiphanes of Syria resumed the work, but his death
again interrupted it; anda century afterward Sulia carried off the columns to
adorn the temple of Capitoline Jove at Rome. In the time of Augustus a number of kings and men of wealth undertook to finishit. But the work dragged
along, and the temple was not dedicated until A. D. 129, the necessary means for
its completion having been supplied by the Emperor Hadrian, a great admirer
of Athens. It had thus been about 650 years in building. No wonder Zeus began
to question whether it ever would be finished. The temple was of the dipteral
class, with over one hundred and twenty Corinthian columns, each about six and
a half feet in diameter and sixty feet in height; sixteen are still standing. Hadrian placed in the cella a magnificent gold and ivory statue of Zeus.

heaven, since the Sun is always present there, and
participates in the feasting?—Then I dropped off into a

“The coming of this stranger yesterday has furnished
the occasion for calling you together. I long ago
wanted to take counsel with you concerning the philosophers; and influenced above all by the Moon and the
things whereof she complains, I have resolved not to
postpone any longer the thorough investigation demanded. For there has lately come to the surface of
human life a class of men, indolent, quarrelsome, conceited, hot-tempered, somewhat lickerish, rather silly,
a lot of cranks and choke-full of impudence and, to use
Homer’s phrase,

and of the times and seasons, when they should bedone. For Pindar see Dream,

they have assumed the august name of ‘virtue’ and go

despicable morals, They bear the most striking resemblance to those actors of tragedy, of whom, if one

upon the hackneyed topic of ‘virtue,’ and indoctrinate
them in the subtleties of argument. In the presence of
their pupils they are all the time sounding the praises
of patience and sobriety, and spitting upon wealth and
pleasure. But how can one adequately describe the gluttony and sensuality in which they indulge when alone
and all by themselves, and how they lick off the dirt
from the obols? And, worst of all, while they accomplish nothing themselves, either for the common welfare or that of the individual, but are good for nothing
and useless,

<head>THE BANQUET; OR, THE LAPITHAE.</head>

<head>INTERLOCUTORS.</head>

<head><label>Philo</label>, a friend, and <label>Lucian</label> himself.</head>

<p>Introduction: The second title of the Dialogue is humorously
derived from the celebrated fight between the Lapithz and the
Centaurs at the marriage feast of Pirithoiis and Hippodamia,
with which Lucian not inaptly compares the banquet here
described. The Lapithz and Centaurs were Thessalian tribes.
According to Homer, the latter were a fierce and savage people
of giant strength, occupying the higher mountain lands. The
conception of them as half horse and half man is of later origin,
coming into vogue after the time of Pindar (500 B. C.). It arose
perhaps from their splendid horsemanship and the habit of spending most of their lives on horseback. Pirithoiis, one of the
Lapithe, invited the chief Centaurs to his wedding feast, where
one of them, becoming heated with wine, undertook to carry off
the bride. A desperate battle ensued in which Theseus and
Nestor participated as friends of Pirithotis, At last, after great
losses on both sides, the Centaurs were completely defeated.
The incidents of this fight, which was regarded, as a symbol of
the long and severe struggle between Greek civilization and
Pelasgic barbarism, formed a favorite subject in Greek temple
art. They are represented with extraordinary spirit and life in
the splendid reliefs of the metopes of the Parthenon at Athens,
the finest of which, called the Elgin Marbles, are now one of the
choicest treasures of the British Museum.</p>

<p>Philo, his curiosity having been aroused by current
reports as to what took place at a certain grand
dinner at which Lycinus was present, interviews him, in order to ascertain the facts.</p>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="1">
    <p><label>Philo</label> All manner of sport, Lycinus, they say
you people had yesterday at the dinner in the house of
Aristeenetus. Unless Charinus misrepresented the
facts, certain philosophers present indulged in some
remarks, over which a quarrel arose of no small propor-
<pb n="p.375"/>

tions; the affair proceeded as far as wounds, and finally
the company broke up in a bloody row.</p>

<p><label>Lycinus</label> And where did Charinus get this information, Philo? He didn’t dine with us.</p>

<p><label>Philo</label> He said he yot it from Dr. Dionicus. The
doctor, too, was himself, I think, one of the company.</p>

<p><label>Lycinus</label> Certainly! He was not, however, present in
person during the whole affair from the very beginning. But he came in late, when the scrimmage was
already about in midcourse, just before they came to
blows. Accordingly, 1 wonder that he was able to give
a clear account at all, as he was not cognizant of the
occurrences that led to the bloody brawl, in which their
love of strife culminated.</p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="2">
<p><label>Philo</label> Yes, Lycinus! And it was on this account
that Charinus himself bade us come to you, if we wanted
to learn the facts, and how everything went off. For he
said that Dionicus himself acknowledged that he
wasn’t present in person during the whole affair, but
that you knew exactly what took place, and could tell
the very words which caused the trouble, inasmuch as
you are not a careless listener to such things, but pay
close attention. So make haste and regale us with this
most delightful entertainment. I don’t know that there
could beany more delightful one—to me at least—especially, as we are going to feast, none the worse for liquor, and in peace and quiet, without shedding any
blood, and out of reach of any missile. Nay, I know
of none more delightful, whether it were graybeards
who played some drunken tricks at the dinner, or
young men, who, under the influence of strong drink,
said and did things which they ought not to at all.</p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="3">
<p><label>Lycinus</label> So you expect me, Philo, to disclose to all
the world and his wife these indiscretions which are
more suited to youth, and to describe in detail matters
which took place under the influence of wine and strong
drink, when we ought to consign them to oblivion, and
regard them all as deeds of the god Dionysus,<ref n="1"/> who
for aught I know permitted one of his own orgies<ref n="2"/>  to

<note n="1"/> Dionysus: God of wine. See Council of Gods, note 3.

<note n="2"/> His own orgies: The secret rites, or worship, practiced by the initiated alone;
used of the mysteries of Demeter, but more commonly of the rites of Dionysus,
or Bacchus, as he was also called. These were characterized by boisterous merriment, feasting and drinking and unrestrained license.

come to a premature close and turn out a joyless affair.
Take care, then, lest it betoken in your case a malicious
sort of person, to be prying into such things, which it
is well to leave behind in the banquet hall, when one
departs. For, as also the saying of the poet has it, “I
hate a guest with a good memory.” No, it wasn’t
right of Dr. Dionicus to divulge these things to Charinus and discharge the dregs of stale stories in a flood
upon men who belong to the guild of philosophers. Get
along with you! I wouldn’t be guilty of telling any
such stuff.</p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="4">
<p><label>Philo</label> This reluctance of yours is all affectation,
Lycinus. But you ought by no means to act so toward
me; for I know to a certainty that you are itching to tell,
far more than I am to hear. Yes, you look to me just as
though, should you be ata loss for hearers, you would
be delighted to goto some pillar or statue and pour
forth the whole story, without pausing or closing your
mouth. Anyhow, should I want to leave now, you’ll
not let me go without hearing it. Rather, you’ll hold
me fast, follow after me, and beg me to stay. And I,
in my turn, will be coy and prudish toward you. Yes,
and if I think fit, Pll go off and get the details from
somebody else—you needn’t tell me.</p>

<p><label>Lycinus</label> Well, you needn’t lose your temper. I'll
give you an account of the affair, seeing you’ve set
your heart upon itso; but be sure and not circulate
the story.</p>

<p><label>Philo</label> No, not unless I’m utterly oblivious of Lycinus! You yourself will do it better than I, and get
the start of me in telling everybody. Accordingly,
there’ll be no need of my saying anything.</p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="5">
<p rend="merge">Well,
then, to proceed, tell me this first! Was it upon the
marriage of his son Zenon that Aristznetus entertained you?</p>

<p><label>Lycinus</label> No! He was giving his own daughter, Cleanthis, in marriage to a philosopher by profession, the
son of the money-lender,<ref n="3"/> Eucritus.</p>

<p><label>Philosopher A</label> right handsome youth, ’pon my word!

<note n="3"/> A Money-lender: Or private banker, a class who made a business of moneychanging and loaning. They acquired great credit and had business connections
in the principal towns of Greece.

<pb n="p.377"/>

Only he’s still quite young and not at all of suitable
age to get married.</p>

<p><label>Lycinus</label> Well, he didn’t find any other more suitable
match for his daughter, I presume. The young man,
however, seemed to be well-behaved and had a liking
for philosophy. And, besides, he was the only son
Eucritus had—a man, by the way, of large means—and
so out of the whole lot of suitors Aristaenetus chose
him as bridegroom.<ref n="4"/> </p>

<p><label>Philo</label> The fact you speak of, that Eucritus is rich,
was, to be sure, no trifling inducement. But who were
the guests, Lycinus?</p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="6">
<p><label>Lycinus</label> As for the rest, why should I name them to
you? Bvt among the philosophers and learned men
whom, I presume, you want to hear about most of all,
there were present the old gentleman, Zenothemis,<ref n="5"/> from
the Porch,<ref n="6"/> and along with him Diphilus—yclept the
Labyrinthine—who was tutor to Zenon, Aristeenetus’
son. Of the Peripatetics there was Cleodemus—you
know the loquacious fellow, fond of cross-questioning
people. His pupils dub him a sword and cleaver.
Yes, and the Epicurean, Hermon, was there. As he
came in the Stoics eyed him askance, and turned away,
and evidently loathed him as though he were a parricide and accurst. These gentlemen were invited to the
dinner because they were friends and acquaintances of
Aristenetus himself, and with them Histiaus, the
grammarian,<ref n="7"/> and the rhetorician, Dionysodorus. 7.
For the sake of Chzereas, the bridegroom, Ion, the Platonist, his tutor, sat with them at the festive board.
He was a sort of dignified looking gentleman—you
might have taken him for a god—and wore upon his
face a decorous air that was truly remarkable. At all

events the multitude, in recognition of the correctness
of his judgment, style him the “Canon.”<ref n="8"/>  As he
passed, they all rose and made room for him, and
greeted him as one of the better class. In a word, the
affair looked as though a god had arrived when Jon,
the admirable, put in an appearance.</p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="8">
<p rend="merge">At length
the time came for the guests—about all of whom
were now present—to take their places at table.<ref n="9"/>  The
ladies, of whom there were not a few, came in upon
the right and occupied the entire divan on that side;
and among them was tho bride, quite closely veiled,
and surrounded by the women. The rest of the crowd
took their places on the side facing the door, according to each one’s rank.</p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="9">
<p rend="merge">Directly opposite the
ladies, first in order sat Kucritus, and next was Aristeenetus. Then a question arose as to which should
have the precedence, Zenothemis, the Stoic, on the
score of his age, or Hermon, the Epicurean; for the
latter was priest of the Dioscuri<ref n="10"/>  and belonged to the
first family in the city. But Zenothemis solved the
difficulty at once.—“ Aristeenetus,”? says he, “if you
consider me inferior to this Epicurean here—to say
nothing else that’s bad about him—I’1] retire, and you
can have your dinner all to yourself.” At the same
time he called his servant and made as if he were going. Then Hermon spoke up. “Take the first place,
Zenothemis! Yet, even if for no other reason, it were
meet for you to give place to one who is, at all events,
a priest, although you have utterly despised Epicurus.”
—“T can’t help laughing,” replied Zenothemis; “ha!
ha! ha! an Epicurean a priest!’"—With these words
he took the seat, and Hermon, for all that, sat next to
him. Then came Cleodemus, the Peripatetic; then
Ion, and next below him the bridegroom. I sat next,
and by my side Diphilus, and below him Zenon, his
pupil, and then came the rhetorician, Dionysodorus,
and Histizwus, the grammarian.

<p><label>Philo</label> Bless me, Lycinus! The banquet you
are describing seems to have been a sort of “Museum,”
or school of philosophers—the most of them. I for my
part highly commend Aristaenetus, because in celebrating the festival that is most longed for, he thought
fit to entertain the wisest in preference to the rest, and
—what indeed was most remarkable—culled the best
from every sect, not those from this school, or from
that, but all promiscuously.</p>

<p><label>Lycinus</label> Of course he did, my friend. For he isn’t one
of the common herd of rich folks, but in fact takes an
interest in education and passes the most of his life in
the company of the cultured.</p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="11">
<p rend="merge">Well, then, to proceed—during the first part of the entertainment there
was general silence, for a varied menu had been provided. However, I needn’t, I presume, enumerate the
viands also—the sauces, sweetmeats and savory dishes
—for there was a plenty of everything. Meanwhile
Cleodemus, bending over toward Ion, said: “D’ye see
that old man”—meaning Zenothemis, for I was listening—“how he is stuffing himself with the dainties, and
has spilled the soup al! over his clothes, and what
things he is helping his servant to, who stands behind
him—thinking that the rest don’t notice it, and all unmindful of those next to him? Call the attention of
Lycinus also to it, so that he can see the performance.”
But I didn’t need Ion to point it out to me, for I had
observed it long before from the high place I occupied.</p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="12">
<p>No sooner had Cleodemus said this, when the
Cynic,<ref n="11"/> Alcidamas, burst unbidden into the room,
quoting as a good joke the stock phrase:

<note n="11"/> The Cynic: This school was founded by Antisthenes (see Dial. of Dead, 27,
N.2). The great name of the sect was his pupil, Diogenes of Sinopé (see Dial. of
Dead, 1. N. 1), who was succeeded by Crates (see Dial. of Dead, 27, N, 3). aoe

us, a favorite character of Lucian's, was of this sect (see Dial. of Dead, 1, N. 3).

he dictum, ‘Live according to nature,” they made the foundation principle of
their philosophy. Accordingly, all external circumsta) an diti such
as food, clothing and lodging, were regarded with indifference. They preached
contentment with what one had, no matter how little it might be-_the less the
better. Pleasure as an object in life they utterly despised. “Rather go mad
than take pleasure in anything,” said Antisthenes. ith them the ideal condition was to have no wants or desires, or the fewest possible. They practiced
absolute independence, freedom, the utmost frankness of speech, contempt for
all social arrangements and conventionalities, and lived apart, mingling with
their fellow-men only to treat them with scornful reprobation. Cf. Auction of
Philosophers, 8 ff.

Aristaenetus, after a word of compliment, bade him
take a seat and sit down by the side of Histizus and
Dionysodorus.—“Get along with you!” cried he. “It’s

bid me upon a chair or a sofa, in the way you folks are

During the rest of the entertainment Alcidamas made

act of eating he kept rattling on about virtue and vice
and flouting at the gold and silver plate. Anyhow, he
persisted in asking Aristaenetus what he wanted of so
many and such big drinking cups, when earthen ones
would answer just as well. At last he became such a
nuisance that Aristaenetus squelched him for the time
being by beckoning to the waiter to give him a huge
cup of wine with less water in it. In doing this he
seemed to have had the best of intentions, for he didn’t
realize what a source of mischief that cup was to be.
As Alcidamas took it, he held his tongue for a little,
and, throwing himself upon the floor, lay there, as he
had threatened, half-naked, and supporting himself
upon his left elbow, at the same time holding the cup
in his right hand, just as the painters represent Heracles

smiling a little—for I suppose I ought to tell you the
minor incidents of the entertainment, especially whatever happened that was uncommonly funny—and I at
once watched very narrowly to see just what it was
that made him smile. After a little the boy approached
for the purpose of receiving the wine-glass from Cleodemus, who thereat squeezed his finger tightly, and I

The boy, on his finger being squeezed, smiled again, but
I presume did not at the same time notice the money.
Accordingly, as he didn’t get them in his hand, the
two drachmas fell to the floor and made something of
a noise; whereupon both parties turned red in the face
very perceptibly. Those near by were in doubt as to
who was the owner of the coins, as the boy declared he
hadn’t dropped them; while Cleodemus, near whom
the noise occurred, made as if he wasn’t responsible for
letting the coins fall. However, the matter passed unheeded, and was hardly noticed, as very few saw it—
Aristaenetus was almost the only one, so it seemed to
me. For he shortly afterward removed the boy on the
sly, without its being observed, and beckoned some
one of the grown-up servants, a great strapping fellow—
some muleteer or hostler—to wait upon Cleodemus. The
affair would have resulted in bringing great disgrace
upon Cleodemus, had it become generally known sooner
and not been suppressed at once, for Aristeenetus showed
great tact in dealing with his drunken behavior. </p>

that not even this space of time should be wanting in
pleasure or empty. He directed the jester to vome in,

be put in still better humor. An ungainly-looking
fellow entered, with his head shaven, except a few hairs
sticking up straight upon the top, and danced, bending

boxing match, and declared that, if the fellow refused,
he would give him the benefit of his club. So then the
ill-starred Satyrion—for that was the jester’s name—
engaged in aset-to with him. The affair was entertaining beyond measure—a professional philosopher grappling with a buffoon, giving blows and receiving them

soon after the contest was over. He had been detained,
he alleged, in attendance upon Polyprepon, the flute
player, who had been attacked with inflammation of
the brain. It was just a bit laughable—the story the
doctor told. He said he entered Polyprepon’s chamber
without knowing that he was already suffering from
this disease. The patient instantly rose up, closed the
door, and drawing a dagger, handed him his flutes and
bade him play upon them, And then, when he couldn’t
do that, the fellow struck him with a whip upon the

blows. And first he himself played abeminably. Next,
handing the flutes to his companion, he received from
him the whip and the dagger, and quick as a flash
flung them through the window into the open court.
After this, grappling with the fellow, with more safety
now, he called the neighbors to his aid, who broke open
the door and rescued him. He exhibited marks of the
blows and some scratches upon his face. Dr. Dionicus,

it may not be true, as many claim, that those who pore
over books only and the thoughts contained therein,
learning deprives of sound sense. At any rate, among
so many philosophers present, it was impossible to find
even one who had the good fortune to be without a single failing, but some did disgraceful things, while others said things more disgraceful. For I could no longer

said this, he essayed to draw aside the linen garment
which the attendant of Zenothemis wore. It proved to
be full of all manner of meats. He succeeded in loosening it and was about to throw the contents upon the

them stoutly.</p>

yet expect to enjoy themselves more than anybody else.”
“Nay!”? replied Zenothemis, “but do you, Cleodemus,
tell us why you regard wealth as not a matter of indifference.” “Nay, not so! but you must answer me,” the
latter replied. And so it went on for some time until
Ion, bending forward so as to be seen the better, exclaimed: “Come, have done with this! If agreeable,
I will propose for general discussion a topic appropriate
to the present feast. And on your part, you must speak
and listen with no disposition to pick a quarrel—in the

our Plato, where dialectics<ref n="40"/>  afforded the most entertainment.’? All present assented, especially Aristaenetus
and Eucritus, with those near them, in the hope at
least that in this way they might get out of the unpleasant predicament. Thinking that peace was now
established, Aristzonetus returned to his own place.</p>

And at the same time there was brought in for us what
is called the entire dinner<ref n="41"/> —for each guest a fowl, a
roast of boar, a hare, and a fish right out of the frying
pan, sesame cakes and relishes. These articles it was
permissible to take away with one. Each guest was
not given a separate dish, but Aristenetus and Eucritus had one in common upon one table, from which
each was to take his own share. In like manner Zenothemis, the Stoic, and Hermon, the Epicurean, had
theirs in common; next in order, Cleodemus and Ion,

Plato, in whose hands it was a remarkably effective instrument.

<p><label>Lycinus</label> Well, to proceed. “If agreeable,’ said
Ion, “I will lead off.”? And then, after a moment’s
pause, he went on to say: “In the presence of such men
as are before me, perhaps I ought to discourse about
archetypes<ref n="42"/>  and things incorporeal and the immortality
of the soul. But that I may not antagonize those who
pursue a different method in philosophy, I will set forth
some reasonable views concerning marriage. The ideal
condition<ref n="43"/> of things would be to forego marriage altogether, and follow the teachings of Plato and Socrates.
At any rate, only such persons can attain to perfection
in virtue. But if one must marry, according to the
doctrines of Plato, our wives should be had in common, so as to avoid jealousy (<foreign>ζῆλος</foreign>).” </p>

Dionysodorus cried out: “Let us have no more of this

what author can we find the word <foreign>ζῆλος</foreign><ref n="44"/> used in the
sense of jealousy?’ “What! do you presume to open
your mouth, you good-for-nothing?” Ion replied. Dionysodorus, also, I believe, returned his abuse in good

<p>Well, after we had had, naturally enough, a good
laugh over this poetic effusion, the next thing on the
program was for each one to carry away the viands
that were set before him. Aristznetus and Eucritus

portion placed before himself, and I mine, and Chereas whatever was set for him. So also did Ion and
Cleodemus. But Diphilug claimed the right to take
also the share of Zenon, who had departed a while before. He insisted that the whole had been provided for

banquet—Zenothemis, I say, leaving the chicken near
himself, seized the one in front of Hermon, which, as
I remarked, was fatter. The latter caught hold of it
on the other side and wasn’t going to permit himself to
be cheated out of it. Then there was shouting, and
they came to blows, and struck each other in the face
with the chickens themselves. Yes, and they seized
one another by the beard and called upon their friends
to help them—Hermon upon Cleodemus, and Zenothemis upon Alcidamas and Diphilus. Some of the company rallied to the support of the latter, others to the
support of the former, with the sole exception of Ion,

distinguished himself as an ally of Zenothemis. He
hit Cleodemus over the head with his club, crushed
Hermon’s jaw, and severely wounded some of the servants who tried to help them. However, they didn’t
give up the struggle, but Cleodemus with his finger

especially do you claim to know?

</p>

<p><label>Chrysippus</label> Well, the art of weaving word-nets, with
which I entangle those who converse with me, and
hedge them about and reduce them to silence by simply
putting a muzzle on them. The famous syllogism<ref n="43"/> —
that’s the name they give this art.</p>

<p><label>Customer</label> Zounds! A pretty irresistible and powerful
weapon that, according to your account!</p>

<p><label>Chrysippus</label> Well, take this for an illustration. Have
you a little child?</p>

<p><label>Customer</label> Of course!</p>

<p><label>Chrysippus</label> Now, suppose a crocodile,<ref n="44"/> finding the child
roaming about by the river’s side, should perchance
seize it and then promise to restore it to you, provided
you state correctly what he has made up his mind to do
about giving up the brat—what would you say was his
intention in the matter?</p>

<p><label>Customer</label> Your question is a poser. For I’m ata loss
what to say first, go as to insure the recovery of the
child. But, for Heaven’s sake, do you make answer
and rescue me the little fellow, lest the monster be too
quick for me, and eat him up.</p>

<p><label>Chrysippus</label> Oh, don’t be alarmed! There are other
things I’ll teach you, yet more wonderful.</p>

<p><label>Customer</label> What are they?</p>

<p><label>Chrysippus</label> Well, there’s the syllogism of the “Reaper,”<ref n="45"/> 

<note n="43"/> The famous syllogism: The Sorites, of which he wasthe inventor. It was a
heap of syllogisms, in which the conclusion of one forms the premise of the next.</p>

<p>and the ion from all ts the predicate of the last with the subject of
the first proposition.

<note n="45"/> Syllogism of the reaper: A philosopher says to a farmer who is thinking of
cutting his corn, “I will prove to you that you will not cut your corn, and what
is more, that it is impossible that you should ever cut it.”</p>

<p>"Indeed, I should like to hear the demonstration,” says the farmer.</p>

<p>“Well, attend!’ replies the philosopher. “You will either cut your corn, or
not cut it, is it not so?”</p>

<p><label>Farmer</label> "Yes, one or the other.”</p>

<p><label>Philosopher</label> “In the first case (if you will cut it), will you not, therefore, either cut,
or not cut it, but you will cut it!”</p>

<p><label>Farmer</label>  "That's clear.”</p>

<p><label>Philosopher</label> "In the other case (if you will not cut it), will you not likewise either
cut, or not cut it, but you will not cut it?”</p>

<p><label>Farmer</label>  "That's to be supposed.” </p>

<p><label>Philosopher</label> "Therefore, is it not true, that you will either cut, or not cut it, but you
cannot cut it at all?”</p>

<p>The farmer made no reply, but went out to his field and cut his corn clean off;
and therefore he had to be sure cut the philosopher's knot, but had not untied
it.—Wieland.

that of the “master,” and above all, the “Electra,” and
that of the “veiled” person.<ref n="46"/> </p>

<p><label>Customer</label>  What do you mean by that of the “veiled”
person, or by the “Hlectra”?</p>

<p><label>Chrysippus</label> Why, I refer to the famous Electra,<ref n="47"/>
daughter of Agamemnon—who at one and the same
time both knows and does not know the very same
things. For when Orestes, whom as yet she does not
recognize, stands by her side, she is aware that Orestes
is her brother, but she doesn’t know that the person
near her is Orestes. As for the “veiled” syllogism,
you shall hear what that is, and a very wonderful
thing it is, too. Now answer me this—do you know
your own father?</p>

<p><label>Customer</label> Yes.</p>

<p><label>Chrysippus</label> Very well! Now suppose I place beside
you somebody with a veil on, and ask—do you know
this person? What will you say?</p>

<p><label>Customer</label> Why, of course, that I don’t know him.</p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="23">
<p><label>Chrysippus</label> But as a matter of fact, this very person was your father. Therefore, if you fail to recognize him, it is plain you don’t know your father.</p>

<p><label>Customer</label> Nay, not so! But if you take the veil off
I shall know the real state of the case. However,
be that as it may, what is the consummation of your
wisdom? Or what will you do when you have arrived
at virtue’s summit?</p>

<p><label>Chrysippus</label> Well, I shall then be occupied about those
things, which according to nature are of the first account—I mean health, wealth and such things. But
first, it is needful to obtain many things by previous
labor, sharpening one’s vision upon parchments, written with small letters, making marginal annotations<ref n="48"/> 

<note n="46"/> The syllogism of the “veiled” person: A veiled person is shown, and one of
his acquaintances is asked whether he knows him. he says yes, he says what
is untrue, for he cannot know who is hidden behind the veil. If he says no, he
equally utters an untruth, for as a matter of fact he does know the veiled person. - Zeller.

<note n="47"/> The Electra: Upon the murder of Agamemnon by Atgisthus and Clyteemnestra, to save the young Orestes from a like fate, his sister, Electra, sent him to
king Strophius in Phocis, by whom the boy was brought up. When he reached
manhood, she reminded him of his duty to avenge his father. Accordingly, he
agreed to meet her at their father's grave, having placed thereon a lock of hair
as a sign that he was near. They had been so long separated, that she did not
recognize him as her brother, until he made himself known.

<note n="48"/> Making marginal annotations, etc.: A thrust at the narrow-minded pedantry
of so many philosophers and scholars, who passed their time in poring over manuscripts written in flne characters, making notes in the margin, delighting in
variations from current usages in language, and attending to the “mint, anise

and cummin,” to the neglect of weightier matters.—Hellebore, a plant to which
the ancients attributed valuable medicinal qualities, especially in mental diseases.
<pb n="p.415"/>

and taking one’s fillof solecisms and odd phrases.
And last and chief of all, you cannot become wise
unless you drink three times in succession of hellebore.</p>

<p><label>Customer</label> That’sa fine programme of yours and exceeding manly. But as to being a skinflint and calculating interest<ref n="49"/>  to a fraction—for I observe that these
also are characteristics of yours—shall we pronounce
them attributes of a man who has already drank the
hellebore and attained perfection in virtue?</p>

<p><label>Chrysippus</label> Yes! Anyhow, it’s only the wiseman who
can with propriety put his money out at usury. For,
as drawing conclusions from premises is his special
business, and money lending and calculating the interest seem to be akin to drawing conclusions, hence the
latter, just like the former, would belong to the good
man only—yes, and it would be his privilege to take
not merely simple interest, as the rest do, but also
compound, You arenot unaware, are you, that one kind
of interest is simple or primary, while the other is compound or secondary—so-called, because it is, as it were,
the offspring of the former? Of course, you see how
the syllogism puts it—if a person receives the simple ivterest, he will receive the compound also; now, as a
matter of fact, he does receive the simple; ergo, he will
also receive the compound.</p>

fees<ref n="50"/>  you take from the young for your wisdom, and

pay for his virtue?</p>

<p><label>Chrysippus</label> Yes, you understand the situation. Not on
my own account do I take pay, but for the sake of him
who gives it. For as one is a sort of spendthrift and
another is grasping, myself I train to be grasping, but
my pupil to be a spendthrift.</p>

two, Apollo and Artemis, and forbade the Thebans to sacrifice to her. This so
angered Apollo and Artemis, that they slew all of them. Niobe then returned

invented to correspond with the latter, which he uses in the phrase of <foreign>οἱ λόγοι ἐξωτερικοί</foreign>, in the sense, probably, of popular arguments, reasonings common among men and hence capable of ready and full comprehension. On the

<head>THE ANGLER; OR, THE RESURRECTION.

<note><p>Introduction: The following dialogue is properly a sequel to
the preceding. In that dialogue the most celebrated names in
philosophy, some of them founders of various schools, had been
subjected to the outrage of being sold at auction in the slave
market at Athens, and their doctrines had been ruthlessly caricatured. Naturally enough—and so Lucian represents it—all
this had aroused a storm of indignation among the professional
philosophers and their adherents. To defend himself he wrote
the present dialogue, and perhaps because he was conscious of
having gone too far and taken liberties, which even the license
of the satirist would scarcely justify. He declares that it was
not so much these venerated names that he had in view, as their
degenerate and unworthy successors, who no longer represented
the spirit of the great masters, or even the letter of their teachings, and yet assumed the prestige and authority of their names.</p>

<p>I may, not unreasonably, accept this explanation, as being
more in harmony with Lucian’s real character and temper as
exhibited in the whole body of his writings. In artistic finish
the Angler is one of his most admirable works; and its tone from
beginning to end reveals the man at his best.</p></note></head>

Theban women were driven mad by the god, and in their Bacchic frenzy mistook
Pentheus for a wild boar, and tore him in pieces.—Orpheus was an early Thracian bard, who, failing to render due honor to Dionysus, was, at his instigation,
torn in pieces by female Bacchanals. According to another version of the
legend, he met this fate while wandering over the Thracian mountains in despair,
because of the loss of his wife, Eurydice.

them known unto men. And they praise while they
recognize each flower, where I picked it, from whom

nosegay, but, in fact, you and your meadow, who have
put forth such varied flowers, so manifold in their hues,
for any one to use who should know how to pluck and
twine them together and arrange them so as to harmonize with each other. Is there, then, aman who after
receiving such benefits from you would set to work to
speak ill of the benefactors, by whose help he came to
be regarded as somebody? Certainly not, unless indeed
he were similar in his nature to Thamyris,<ref n="19"/> who essayed
to rival the Muses, from whom he had received the gift
of song, or like Hurytus, who undertook to cope with
Apollo in the use of the bow, notwithstanding the latter

set before yourself this one aim—namely, to speak ill

you for spreading out before you that meadow, and freely
permitting you to cull the flowers for yourself and to

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="8">
<p><label>Lucian</label>  See here, gentlemen! You are listening
in the heat of passion, and accordingly not one of the
things that are just and right do you assent to. And
yet I never should have imagined that anger could
reach Plato, Chrysippus, or Aristotle, or the rest of you;
on the contrary you seemed to me to be indeed the only
ones far removed from such an influence. Albeit, do
not put meto death without trial, at least, excellent sirs,
or before sentence. Anyhow, this, too, was a maxim
of yours that we should not use force in our relations
as citizens, nor act on the principle that might makes
right, but should settle our differences by arbitration,
granting and receiving, each in his turn, the right of
speech. Choose, therefore, a judge, and bring in your
indictment, either all of you at once, or let him whom
you may appoint to speak for all. I will then make
my defense against the charges; and if I am proved
guilty, and the court comes to this decision concerning
me, I will, of course, submit to be punished as I deserve. But don’t you undertake to use any violence. If, on the other hand, after rendering up my account, I
am found clear of guilt and not open to censure on
your part, the jury shall set me free; but as for you,

say you are a rhetorician, pretty well versed in pleading and clever in speech. But whom do you want to
have as umpire? Is it some one whom you will not
wrongfully influence by bribery to vote for you?—you
are often up to such tricks, you know.</p>

<p><label>Lucian</label>  Have no fears on that score at least! No
such questionable or suspicious character would I expect to be appointed arbitrator, nor one who will sell me
his vote. At all events, seehere! Philosophy herself,

man’s defense. It isnot our way, you know, to punish
a man before he is tried. That would be highly unprofessional and characteristic of men in the heat of passion,
and of those who base their right upon club Jaw. If
we then stone a man to death without his having ha

Such a course is better and more in accordance with

You’ll need them by and by in the courtroom. But
where can one find Philosophy? For I don’t know
where she lives. And yet 1 wandered about a long
time in search of her abode, that I might hold converse
with her. Accordingly, falling in with certain persons
clad in coarse cloaks<ref n="22"/>  and with long flowing beards,
who said they had come from her very presence, and
thinking that they knew, I would question them. But
they, a good deal more ignorant than I, either made me
no answer at all, lest they should betray their own lack
of knowledge, or they pointed out to me one door after
another. At all events, from that day to this, I have
not been able to find her dwelling.</p>

coming out, all of them of sad countenance, neatly
dressed and of thoughtful mien. Accordingly, wedged
in the crowd, I myself also entered with them. And
then I used to seea rather insignificant woman, with
nothing artless about her, though she tried to order herself with especial reference to looking plain and unadorned; but I observed at once that not even the apparently loose arrangement of her hair had she left
without ornament, nor was the way she wore her
mantle even without affectation. It was evident that
she resorted for adornment to these artifices, while to
enhance her good looks she also puton this négligé
air. There were some indications upon her face of

which her lovers paid her for her beauty. And if anybody gave her something, she made no bones of accepting it. The wealthier ones she let sit down by her
side, while she had not so much as a glance for the poor
among her lovers. Many a time, too, when she uncovered her neck as though by accident, I saw necklaces of
gold larger than any dog collar. Well, I at once retired backwards from her presence, with a pitying look,
of course, for the poor wretches whom she was leading
around, not by the nose, but by the beard, and who, like

<p><label>Lucian</label>  Very true! At all events, you see to how
many people I am an object of hatred and how I am
in peril because of it. Yet, in spite of this, I have a
very precise knowledge of the opposite sentiment also—
I mean that which is described by such expressions as
begin with love. For I’m a lover of truth, a lover of
beauty, and a lover of simplicity, and whatever else has
to do with loving. Albeit, very few are worthy of this
profession. While those ranged under the opposite
head and _ better suited to be objects of one’s hate, are
legion. I am, therefore, in danger of soon forgetting
the former art for want of practice, but am likely to
attain a thorough understanding of this latter.

    <stage>Scene III. Vestibule of the temple. The trial.</stage>

<p><label>Diogenes</label> What sort of men we were during our
life, Philosophy, you know quite accurately, and I need
say nothing on that point. For, to keep silence as respects myself, yet, as for this Pythagoras here, and
Plato, Aristotle, Chrysippus and the rest—who does
not know how much that is noble they brought with
them into the world? But I will state at once what
insults this thrice-accursed Mr. Free-speaker here has
heaped upon us, notwithstanding we are men of such
high character. According to his story, he is a sort of
rhetorician, having abandoned the courts and his notable achievements therein; and whatever force or vigor
he had acquired in public speech, all this he has arrayed
against us; and he does not cease speaking ill of us,
stigmatizing us as quacks and cheats, and persuading
the multitude to mock at and despise us, as though we
were of no account. Nay, more, he has already caused
ourselves and you, Philosophy, to be hated also by the
majority of people, characterizing your principles as
stuff aud nonsense, and detailing, with intent to ridicule, the most weighty of the doctrines in which you
trained us. And the result has been that he is clapped
and applauded by the spectators, while we are treated
despitefully. For such is the nature of the great mass
of people, that they take pleasure in listening to raillery
and abuse, especially whenever the things that are regarded as most sacred are pulled to pieces—just as in
fact, they used to relish it of old also, when Aristophanes<ref n="40"/>  and Eupolis brought forward upon the boards

caricatured him in the rather outrageous comedies they
put upon the stage. Those men, however, ventured to
use such language about one person and in the theater
of Dionysus,<ref n="41"/> when it was allowable todo so. The jest
seemed a part of the festival itself, and maybe the god
enjoyed it, for, you know, he’s sort of fond of laughing.</p>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="26">
<p>But this fellow, after long reflection and preparation and having entered some slanders in a thick
note-book, calls together the leading men, and with his
voice pitched high, defames Plato, Pythagoras, Aristotle, Chrysippus yonder, and me—yes, all philosophers generally—though there is no feast approaching,
and he has not been personally wronged by us. The
affair would have admitted of some excuse for him,
had he acted in self-defense and not been himself the
aggressor. Yes, and the claverest trick of all is, that,
in doing these things, he even assumes your name,
Philosophy, and having entrapped Dialogue<ref n="42"/>  a relative
of ours, he makes use of him as a performer to help in
attacking us. And besides, he has persuaded Menippus,<ref n="43"/> a pupil of mine, to aid him in caricaturing us for
the most part—the only one who is absent and does not
join with us in the prosecution, but has proved a traitor
to the common cause, 27. For all this the respondent
deserves to pay the penalty. Yes, for what could he
say before so many witnesses, after ridiculing the most
sacred things? At any rate, it would have a salutary
effect upon them also, should they see him punished, in
order that no one else might hereafter hold philosophy
in contempt; since indeed to keep quiet and, when insulted, to put up with it would reasonably be regarded
as an indication not of moderation, but of a want of
manhood, and a mark of simplicity. For who could

<p rend="merge">And ever
since I obtained a glimpse merely into your realm, I
have regarded you with admiration—as, indeed, I
couldn’t help doing—and all these gentlemen, too. For
they make the laws that pertain to the best life, and
reach out a helping hand to those who are striving
after it, and give them the best and most serviceable
counsel. And such it will prove, if a person does not
transgress this advice or lose his footing, but, keeping
his eye intently fixed upon the principles that you gentlemen have prescribed, orders and governs his own
life according to them. Upon my word, that’s the
very thing few do, even among our own contemporaries.</p>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="31">
<p>But when I saw that many were possessed by a
love, not for philosophy, but only for the honor they
could get out of the thing, and that they bore a striking
resemblance to good men merely in matters that are
external and common, such as every one can easily
imitate—I mean the cut of the beard, the gait, and the
way of wearing one’s cloak—while in their life and
actions they belied their looks, practiced the opposite of
what you enjoin and blasted the reputation of the profession—when I saw all this, I wasindignant. And the
case appeared to me much the same as if an actor of
tragedy, who is personally soft and effeminate, should
play the part of Achilles,<ref n="45"/> Theseus, or even of Heracles
himself, without having either the port or the voice of
a hero, but giving himself airs under so big a mask,
that even Helen<ref n="46"/>  or Polyxena would never put up with
it, notwithstanding it looks a dea] like them, much less
Heracles, the hero of many a glorious victory. Nay,
he, I fancy, would crush in a trice such a fellow, mask
and all, with a blow from his club, for having treated
him with such disrespect as to make a woman of him.</p>

him a good beating with such sticks as were haudy.
But, Philosophy, what appeared to me most dreadful
was this. When men saw one of these people practicing anything base, shameful or outrageous, there
wasn’t a person, who didn’t forthwith blame Philosophy
herself and Chrysippus, Plato, or Pythagoras, or the one
after whom the reprobate was in the habit of calling
himself and whose system of doctrine he imitated; and
from his evil course of life they drew unfavorable conclusions concerning you, who have been dead this long
time. For there was no opportunity to compare him
with you while you were alive, but you were out of the
way—whereas he used to practice abominable indecencies in plain sight of all men, so that you shared by

<p rend="merge">And furthermore, oddest of all, the mass of
them make a very thorough study of your works, but
live just as though they read and conned them over
merely with a view to practicing the opposite. Everything they say—for instance, that one should despise
money and glory, and regard nothing as good but what
is morally beautiful, that one should be incapable of
anger, hold in contempt those who make a brilliant
show and converse with them as their equal—all this,
ye gods, is noble, wise, and really very admirable.
But these very doctrines, even, they teach for hire.
They are lost in admiration for the rich and are all
agape after their money. They are more irritable than
any little cur, more cowardly than any hare, more
fawning than any monkey. In grossness they outdo
any ass, in thievishness any cat, and any cock in fondness for fighting. Accordingly they make a laughingstock of themselves, as they jostle one another about
the doors of the rich in the scramble for what they have
to bestow, regale themselves with dinners of many
covers, and right then and there indulge in vulgar
praise of the host, and stuff themselves beyond all propriety. Yes, and they wear an air of discontent and
discuss over their cups doleful subjects out of harmony
with the occasion, and cannot abide the undiluted wine
they drink. While the unprofessional guests who
drink with them, laugh, of course, and spit upon philosophy, to think that she breeds such worthless fellows.</p>

Why, it’s just as if somebody in royal attire, wearing

receiving something, there’s lots of talk about the duty
of sharing with others, and how that wealth is neither
good nor bad, and—“ Why, what is gold or silver coin?
nothing different from the pebbles on the seashore.”
But :when some old confrére and friend, in need of aid,
approaches and begs for a little from their abundance,
then they are dumb and at a loss what to say, profess
they don’t know the man and retract their theories and
shift to the contrary ground. As for the most of those
doctrines of theirs concerning friendship, and their virtue and moral beauty—well, they’ve all taken to flight

at random in their daily discussions, as though they
were fighting shadows.</p>

left behind, and virtue has taken to flight. Dogs, you
know, behave in much the same way. Whenever a
person casts a bone among them, they spring up and
bite one another and snarl at the one that seizes the
bone first. Once upon a time a certain Kgyptian king,
so the story goes, taught monkeys to dance a kind of
war dance. The creatures—they are, you know, very

became proficient and were in the habit of dancing, clad
in purple robes and with masks on. Fora while the
show was in high favor, until a waggish spectator,
who had some nuts in his pocket, threw them into the

the dancing, and instead of Pyrrhic<ref n="51"/>  dancers, they became monkeys again—that’s what they really were—
smashed their masks, tore their clothing to shreds, and
fought with each other for the possession of the fruit.

and take a peep into the city, and summon also the
philosophers.</p>

bring five syllogisms. For without these a man can’t

pass unnoticed. Anyhow, this is the strangest thing

<head>THE CHOICE OF HERACLES. <ref n="1"/></head>

<p>In this allegory, which was probably part of a larger
work entitled “Horae,” Prodicus represents Heracles
as having just come of age, when it was necessary for
him to determine what path he would follow for life,
that of virtue, or that of vice. He retires into some
sequestered spot on Mount Cithzeron and there sits
down, “at a loss whither to turn.” Then two stately
women seem to approach, one fair to look upon, noble
in outward form, her person adorned with purity, her
eyes with modesty, chaste of mien and dressed in white;
the other pampered into obesity and effeminacy, her
face beautified with cosmetics, that she might seem
fairer and more ruddy than she really was, and carrying herself in such wise as to appear more erect than
she was by nature; her eyes she kept wide open, and
she was dressed in such fashion as to show off her
youthful beauty to the best advantage. She casts
many a glance at herself and looks around to see if anybody else is watching her, and often also gazes at her
own shadow.</p>

<p>As they drew nearer to Heracles, the first mentioned
advanced at the same pace as before, but the latter,
wishing to be first, ran up to him and said: “I observe,
my dear Heracles, that you are at a loss what path to
follow for life. If now you make me your friend, I
will conduct you along the pleasantest and easiest road,
and there is not one of all the pleasures of life that you
shall fail to taste of, and you shall live in entire ignorance of its stern realities, In the first place, you will
have no occasion to trouble yourself about wars or
affairs of state, but it shall be the one object of your life

Lifer Luctan, a translation of Which is included in the Introduction to this
work,

to consider what delicacies you can discover in the way
of food or drink; what sight or sound may afford you
delight; what things you may get pleasure from through
the sense of smell or touch, and what favorites you
may find the most enjoyment in associating with, how
you can sleep most softly and bow yon can obtain all
these things with the least possible labor. And if ever
there should be any suspicion of a failure in the supply
of these things, you will have no occasion to fear that I
shall put you under the necessity of procuring them by
toil and suffering hardship in body or soul; but you
shall enjoy the fruits of the labors of others and keep
your hands off nothing from which you can derive
some advantage. For to those who company with me,
I give the power of receiving benefit from every quarter.”</p>

<p>On hearing these things, Heracles said: ‘Woman,
what is thy name?”

“My friends,” she replied, “call me Good-fortune,
while they who hate me nickname me, Vice.”</p>

<p>In the meantime the other woman approached and
said: “I, too, have come unto you, my dear Heracles,
for I knew your parents and carefully observed your
disposition while you were being educated. Hence I
anticipate that if you direct your steps in the path
which leads to me, you will become a very good workman in all that is beautiful and noble, while I shall
appear yet more honored and more distinguished for
good deeds. I shall not try to beguile you with promises of pleasure. But I will truthfully recount to you
the facts just as the gods have ordered them. For of
all the good and beautiful things that exist, the gods
bestow nothing upon men without toiland diligence.
But if you wish the gods to be propitious to you, you
must serve the gods; or if you would have the love of
your friends, you must show kindness to your friends;
or if you have your heart set upon being honored by
some city, you must render the city some service; or if
you aspire to be admired by all Greece on the score of
goodness, you must endeavor to confer some benefit
upon Greece; or if you desire your land to bear bountiful crops, you must cultivate the soil; or if you think
<pb n="p.459"/>

you ought to grow rich from your flocks and herds, you
must look after your live stock; or if you are eager to
become great by means of war, and wish to be able to
set free your friends and subdue your enemies, you
must learn the theory itself of war from those who
understand it, and must put it in practice; and especially if you would have a powerful physique, you must
accustom your body to be subordinate to your will, and
must exercise it with the aid of labors and sweat.”</p>

<p>Then Vice interrupting, said—according to the account of Prodicus: “Do you reflect, my dear Heracles,
how difficult and long is the path which this woman
describes to you as leading to her delights? Whereas,
I will conduct you by an easy and short road to the
good-fortune which I offer.”</p>

<p>Then Virtue said: “You wretch! What good thing
have you? Or what pleasures do you know, when
you are unwilling to do anything to get them?—you who
do not even wait for the desire for pleasures, but before
desire comes, take your fill of everything, eat before
you are hungry, drink before you are thirsty, and that
you may find delight in eating, procuring for yourself
skilled cooks—yes, you who provide costly wines, that
you may drink with relish, and insummer run about in
search of snow with which to cool them; and that you
may enjoy sleep, provide not only soft beds, but couches
and rockers for the couches. For you desire slumber
not on account of toil, but because you have nothing
whatever todo. You provoke sensual indulgence before there is occasion for it, resorting to all manner of
devices. Yes, you educate your own friends to these
things, at night running riot, and sleeping the best
part of the day. Though immortal, you are an outcast
from the society of the gods and held in contempt by
good men. The sweetest strain the ear takes in, your
own praise, you never hear, and the most charming
sight the eye can see you never behold, for never have
you beheld a noble deed of your own doing. Who
would believe anything you said? And who would
shure anything with you when in need? And who in
his right mind would venture to make one of your company? The young among your companions are weakly
<pb n="p.460"/>

in body, while the old are become silly in mind, during
youth supported in affluence and without toil, but passing old age in servile labor and in want, disgraced by
what they have done and weighed down by what they
are now doing, having exhausted their pleasures in
youth and stored up sufferings for age.</p>

<p>“But I live with the gods; I live with good men.
No good deed, either divine or human; takes place
without my help. I am honored above all, both with
gods and with men, with whom it is meet that I should
be. I am a beloved fellow workman with artisans, for
masters a faithful sentinel over their houses, a welldisposed assistant to house-s'aves, a worthy sharer in
the labors of peace and a staunch ally in the operations
of war, and a most excellent partner in friendship.
My friends have sweet enjoyment of food and drink,
with no care to disturb. They patiently wait until they
have an appetite for them. Sleep is at their command,
sweeter than that which they have who are strangers to
toil, and they are neither weighed down when deprived
of it, nor for the sake of it do they omit to attend to
their duties. The young rejoice in the praises of their
elders, while their elders exulJt in the honors paid them
by the young, and delight to recall the deeds of olden
times, and take pleasure in doing well the deeds of the
present; through me they are friends of the gods and
beloved by their friends and bonored each in his own
country. And when the end appointed by fate
comes, they lie not down unhonored and forgotten, but
are remembered in all time to come and flourish in
song and story. By going through such labors, my
dear Heracles, child of noble parents, it is within your
power to have the most blessed good-fortune.”</p>

<p>Such substantially is the account that Prodicus gives
of the education of Heracles by Virtue. He, however,
clothed his thoughts in far more splendid language
than I now do. It, therefore, becomes you, Aristippus,
to lay these things to heart and to endeavor in some
measure to take thought also for the coming years of

your life.

<head>APPENDIX II.</head>

<p>PEREGRINUS, §§ 11-13. At this time also he made
himself proficient in the marvelous wisdom of the
Christians by keeping company, around about Palestine, with their priests and scribes. Yes, and would
you believe it?—in a short time he made them out to be
mere children in comparison with himself, who united
in his own person alone the offices of prophet, master of
ceremonies, head of the synagogue, and everything.
And of their books he explained and interpreted some,
and many he himself also wrote, and they came to look
upon him as a god, made him their law-giver and chose
him as their patron. At all events, they still worship
that extraordinary man, who was crucified in Palestine
for introducing into the world this new religious sect.</p>

<p>Just about this time Peregrinus Proteus was seized
on this account and thrown into prison, which very
circumstance procured for him no small honor during
his subsequent career and the reputation for wonderful
powers, and the popularity of which he was passionately fond. However, now that he had been put in
bonds, the Christians, looking upon the thing as a misfortune, left no stone unturned in their efforts to secure
his release. Then, when thia proved to be impracticable, they all the time zealously rendered him ministries
of every other sort. From earliest dawn aged widows
and orphan children were to be seen waiting at the
door of the prison; and men of rank among them even
obtained the privilege of sleeping with him within by
bribing the prison guards. Then they were wont to bring
in all manner of viands and read their sacred Scriptures, and our most excellent Peregrinus—for that was
still his name—was dubbed by them a new Socrates.</p>

<p>Moreover, there came certain even from the cities of
Asia, sent by the Christians at the common charge, to
<pb n="p.462"/>

help the man, and advocate his cause, and comfort
him. They exhibit extraordinary activity, whenever
some such thing occurs affecting their common interest.
In short, they are lavish of everything. And what is
more, on the pretext of his imprisonment, many contributions of money from them came to Peregrinus at
that time, and he made no little income out of it.
Why, these poor wretches have persuaded themselves
that they are going to be every whit immortal and live
forever; wherefore they both despise death and voluntarily devote themselves to it—the most of them.
Moreover, their first law-giver persuaded them that they
all are brethren one of another, when once they come
out and reject the gods of the Greeks, and worship that
crucified sophist and live according to his requirements,
Therefore they esteem all things alike as of small account, and regard their property as common, having received such ideas from others, without any adequate
basis for their faith. If, then, any cheat came among
them and a trickster able to manage things, in a very
short time he got ever so rich, laughing in his sleeve at
these unsophisticated folk.
