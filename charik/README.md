## Towards a Digital Charikles

This directory contains the first steps towards a digital version of the 1877 edition of Wilhelm Becker's Charikles, a novelized description of daily life in Ancient Greece with 44,000 words of text, 77,000 words of footnotes and more than 200,000 words of appendices. I created OCR-generated textual versions of all three volumes. I also completed a first pass at tagging the structure and the citations in volumes 1 and 2.

Students, with no knowledge of Greek or Latin were able to cut and paste the untranslated Greek and Latin source texts into Large Language Models such as Claude, Bard and ChatGPT. They were able to make very effective use of the primary sources. Several students focused their final projects on comparing the output of multiple LLMs. They were very much able to determine which translation was superior when one was incorrect.
